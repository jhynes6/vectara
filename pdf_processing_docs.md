How to parse PDF docs for RAGTopicsAboutAPI docsSourceToggle themeToggle themeSep 29, 2024How to parse PDF docs for RAGKatia Gil Guzman(OpenAI), Mitch Welzen(OpenAI)Open in GitHubView as MarkdownData preparationRetrieval-augmented generationWrapping upThis notebook shows how to leverage GPT-4o to turn rich PDF documents such as slide decks or exports from web pages into usable content for your RAG application.
This technique can be used if you have a lot of unstructured data containing valuable information that you want to be able to retrieve as part of your RAG pipeline.
For example, you could build a Knowledge Assistant that could answer user queries about your company or product based on information contained in PDF documents.
The example documents used in this notebook are located at data/example_pdfs. They are related to OpenAI's APIs and various techniques that can be used as part of LLM projects.Data preparation
In this section, we will process our input data to prepare it for retrieval.
We will do this in 2 ways:
Extracting text with pdfminer
Converting the PDF pages to images to analyze them with GPT-4o
You can skip the 1st method if you want to only use the content inferred from the image analysis.Setup
We need to install a few libraries to convert the PDF to images and extract the text (optional).
Note: You need to install poppler on your machine for the pdf2image library to work. You can follow the instructions to install it here.%pip install pdf2image -q

You will be provided with an image of a PDF page or a slide. Your goal is to deliver a detailed and engaging presentation about the content you see, using clear and accessible language suitable for a 101-level audience.
If there is an identifiable title, start by stating the title to provide context for your audience.
Describe visual elements in detail:
- **Diagrams**: Explain each component and how they interact. For example, "The process begins with X, which then leads to Y and results in Z."
- **Tables**: Break down the information logically. For instance, "Product A costs X dollars, while Product B is priced at Y dollars."
Focus on the content itself rather than the format:
- **DO NOT** include terms referring to the content format.
- **DO NOT** mention the content type. Instead, directly discuss the information presented.
Keep your explanation comprehensive yet concise:
- Be exhaustive in describing the content, as your audience cannot see the image.
- Exclude irrelevant details such as page numbers or the position of elements on the image.
Use clear and accessible language:
- Explain technical terms or concepts in simple language appropriate for a 101-level audience.
Engage with the content:
- Interpret and analyze the information where appropriate, offering insights to help the audience understand its significance.

Fine-tuning is a process where a pre-existing model, known as a public model, is trained using specific training
data. This involves providing the model with a set of input/output examples to learn from. The goal is to adjust
the model so that it can respond accurately to similar inputs in the future.
The diagram illustrates this process: starting with a public model, training data is used in a training phase to
produce a fine-tuned model. This refined model is better equipped to handle specific tasks or datasets.
For effective fine-tuning, it is recommended to use between 50 to 100 examples, although the minimum requirement is
10 examples. This ensures the model has enough data to learn from and improve its performance.

Before embedding the content, we will chunk it logically by page.
For real-world scenarios, you could explore more advanced ways to chunk the content:
Cutting it into smaller pieces
Adding data - such as the slide title, deck title and/or the doc description - at the beginning of each piece of content. That way, each independent chunk can be in context
For the sake of brevity, we will use a very simple chunking strategy and rely on separators to split the text by page.# Chunking content by page and merging together slides text & description if applicable

RAG stands for "Retrieve information to Augment the model’s knowledge and Generate the output." This process
involves using a language model (LLM) to enhance its responses by accessing external information sources.
Here's how it works:
1. **User Query**: A user asks a question, such as "What is your return policy?"
2. **LLM Processing**: The language model receives the question and initiates a search for relevant information.
3. **Information Retrieval**: The LLM accesses a knowledge base or external sources to find the necessary details.
In this example, the information retrieved includes:
- Total refunds available from 0 to 14 days.
- 50% value vouchers for returns between 14 to 30 days.
- A $5 discount on the next order for returns after 30 days.
4. **Response Generation**: The LLM uses the retrieved information to generate a coherent response for the user.
For instance, it might say, "You can get a full refund up to 14 days after the purchase, then up to 30 days you
would get a voucher for half the value of your order."
This method allows the model to provide accurate and up-to-date answers by leveraging external data sources.

**Good for:**
- **Introducing new information to the model:** RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is effective for updating a
model's knowledge by incorporating new data.
- **Reducing hallucinations by controlling content:** While RAG can help minimize hallucinations, it's important to
note that they can still occur.
**Not good for:**
- **Teaching the model a specific format, style, or language:** For these tasks, it's better to use fine-tuning or
custom models.

Technical patterns
Data preparation: chunking
Why chunking?
If your system doesn’t require
entire documents to provide
relevant answers, you can
chunk them into multiple pieces
for easier consumption (reduced
cost & latency).
Other approaches: graphs or
map-reduce
Things to consider
●
Overlap:
○
○
Should chunks be independent or overlap one
another?
If they overlap, by how much?
●
Size of chunks:
○ What is the optimal chunk size for my use case?
○
Do I want to include a lot in the context window or
just the minimum?
● Where to chunk:
○
○
Should I chunk every N tokens or use speciﬁc
separators?
Is there a logical way to split the context that would
help the retrieval process?
● What to return:
○
○
Should I return chunks across multiple documents
or top chunks within the same doc?
Should chunks be linked together with metadata to
indicate common properties?

-------------------------------
Technical patterns
Data preparation: embeddings
What to embed?
Depending on your use case
you might not want just to
embed the text in the
documents but metadata as well
- anything that will make it easier
to surface this speciﬁc chunk or
document when performing a
search
Examples
Embedding Q&A posts in a forum
You might want to embed the title of the posts,
the text of the original question and the content of
the top answers.
Additionally, if the posts are tagged by topic or
with keywords, you can embed those too.
Embedding product specs
In additional to embedding the text contained in
documents describing the products, you might
want to add metadata that you have on the
product such as the color, size, etc. in your
embeddings.

-------------------------------
Technical patterns
Data preparation: augmenting content
What does “Augmenting
content” mean?
Augmenting content refers to
modiﬁcations of the original content
to make it more digestible for a
system relying on RAG. The
modiﬁcations could be a change in
format, wording, or adding
descriptive content such as
summaries or keywords.
Example approaches
Make it a guide*
Reformat the content to look more like
a step-by-step guide with clear
headings and bullet-points, as this
format is more easily understandable
by an LLM.
Add descriptive metadata*
Consider adding keywords or text that
users might search for when thinking
of a speciﬁc product or service.
Multimodality
Leverage models
such as Whisper or
GPT-4V to
transform audio or
visual content into
text.
For example, you
can use GPT-4V to
generate tags for
images or to
describe slides.
* GPT-4 can do this for you with the right prompt

-------------------------------
Technical patterns
Input processing: input augmentation
What is input augmentation?
Example approaches
Augmenting the input means turning
it into something diﬀerent, either
rephrasing it, splitting it in several
inputs or expanding it.
This helps boost performance as
the LLM might understand better
the user intent.

-------------------------------
Technical patterns
Input processing: NER
Why use NER?
Using NER (Named Entity
Recognition) allows to extract
relevant entities from the input, that
can then be used for more
deterministic search queries.
This can be useful when the scope
is very constrained.
Example
Searching for movies
If you have a structured database containing
metadata on movies, you can extract genre,
actors or directors names, etc. from the user
query and use this to search the database
Note: You can use exact values or embeddings after
having extracted the relevant entities

Retrieval: search
How to search?
Semantic search
Keyword search
Search query
There are many diﬀerent
approaches to search depending on
the use case and the existing
system.
Using embeddings, you
can perform semantic
searches. You can
compare embeddings
with what is in your
database and ﬁnd the
most similar.
If you have extracted
speciﬁc entities or
keywords to search for,
you can search for these
in your database.
Based on the extracted
entities you have or the
user input as is, you can
construct search queries
(SQL, cypher…) and use
these queries to search
your database.
You can use a hybrid approach and combine several of these.
You can perform multiple searches in parallel or in sequence, or
search for keywords with their embeddings for example.
15
-------------------------------
Technical patterns
Retrieval: multi-step retrieval
What is multi-step retrieval?
In some cases, there might be
several actions to be performed to
get the required information to
generate an answer.
Things to consider
●
Framework to be used:
○ When there are multiple steps to perform,
consider whether you want to handle this
yourself or use a framework to make it easier
●
Cost & Latency:
○
○
Performing multiple steps at the retrieval
stage can increase latency and cost
signiﬁcantly
Consider performing actions in parallel to
reduce latency
●
Chain of Thought:
○
○
Guide the assistant with the chain of thought
approach: break down instructions into
several steps, with clear guidelines on
whether to continue, stop or do something
else.
This is more appropriate when tasks need to
be performed sequentially - for example: “if
this didn’t work, then do this”
16
-------------------------------
Technical patterns
Retrieval: re-ranking
What is re-ranking?
Example approaches
Re-ranking means re-ordering the
results of the retrieval process to
surface more relevant results.
This is particularly important when
doing semantic searches.
Rule-based re-ranking
You can use metadata to rank results by relevance. For
example, you can look at the recency of the documents, at
tags, speciﬁc keywords in the title, etc.
Re-ranking algorithms
There are several existing algorithms/approaches you can use
based on your use case: BERT-based re-rankers,
cross-encoder re-ranking, TF-IDF algorithms…

Answer Generation: context window
How to manage context?
Depending on your use case, there are
several things to consider when
including retrieved content into the
context window to generate an answer.
Things to consider
●
Context window max size:
○
○
There is a maximum size, so putting too
much content is not ideal
In conversation use cases, the
conversation will be part of the context
as well and will add to that size
●
Cost & Latency vs Accuracy:
○ More context results in increased
latency and additional costs since there
will be more input tokens
Less context might also result in
decreased accuracy
○
●
“Lost in the middle” problem:
○ When there is too much context, LLMs
tend to forget the text “in the middle” of
the content and might look over some
important information.

How to optimise?
There are a few diﬀerent
methods to consider when
optimising a RAG application.
Try them from left to right, and

approaches if needed.
Prompt Engineering
Few-shot examples
Fine-tuning
At each point of the
process, experiment with
diﬀerent prompts to get
the expected input format
or generate a relevant
output.
Try guiding the model if
the process to get to the
ﬁnal outcome contains
several steps.
If the model doesn’t
behave as expected,
provide examples of what
you want e.g. provide
example user inputs and
the expected processing
format.
If giving a few examples
isn’t enough, consider
ﬁne-tuning a model with
more examples for each
step of the process: you
can ﬁne-tune to get a
speciﬁc input processing
or output format.

Technical patterns
Answer Generation: safety checks
Why include safety checks?
Just because you provide the model
with (supposedly) relevant context
doesn’t mean the answer will
systematically be truthful or on-point.
Depending on the use case, you
might want to double-check.

**Technical Patterns**
This image outlines four key technical patterns involved in data processing and answer generation:
1. **Data Preparation**
- **Chunking**: Breaking down data into smaller, manageable pieces.
- **Embeddings**: Converting data into numerical formats that can be easily processed by machine learning
models.
- **Augmenting Content**: Enhancing data with additional information to improve its quality or usefulness.
2. **Input Processing**
- **Input Augmentation**: Adding extra data or features to the input to improve model performance.
- **NER (Named Entity Recognition)**: Identifying and classifying key entities in the text, such as names,
dates, and locations.
- **Embeddings**: Similar to data preparation, embeddings are used here to represent input data in a format
suitable for processing.
3. **Retrieval**
- **Search**: Locating relevant information from a dataset.
- **Multi-step Retrieval**: Using multiple steps or methods to refine the search process and improve accuracy.
- **Re-ranking**: Adjusting the order of retrieved results based on relevance or other criteria.
4. **Answer Generation**
- **Context Window**: Using a specific portion of data to generate relevant answers.
- **Optimisation**: Improving the efficiency and accuracy of the answer generation process.
- **Safety Checks**: Ensuring that the generated answers are safe and appropriate for use.
-------------------------------
**Technical Patterns: Data Preparation**
This presentation focuses on the process of preparing data for easier consumption by large language models (LLMs).
1. **Content Chunking**:
- Documents are divided into smaller, manageable pieces. This makes it easier for LLMs to process the
information.
2. **Embeddings**:
- Each chunk of content is converted into embeddings, which are numerical representations (e.g., 0.983, 0.123,
0.289) that capture the semantic meaning of the text. These embeddings are then stored in a knowledge base.
3. **Augmenting Content**:
- Content can be enhanced using LLMs. For example, GPT-4 can be used to rephrase, summarize, and generate bullet
points from the text.
4. **Best Practices**:
- Pre-process content for LLM consumption by adding summaries and headers for each part.
- Curate relevant data sources to ensure quality and relevance.
5. **Common Pitfalls**:
- Avoid having too much low-quality content.
- Ensure documents are not too large, as this can hinder processing efficiency.
This approach helps in organizing and optimizing data for better performance and understanding by LLMs.
-------------------------------
**Technical Patterns: Data Preparation - Chunking**
**Why Chunking?**
Chunking is a technique used when your system doesn't need entire documents to provide relevant answers. By
breaking documents into smaller pieces, you can make data easier to process, which reduces cost and latency. This
approach is beneficial for systems that need to handle large volumes of data efficiently. Other methods for data
preparation include using graphs or map-reduce.
**Things to Consider**
1. **Overlap:**
- Should chunks be independent or overlap with one another?
- If they overlap, by how much should they do so?
2. **Size of Chunks:**
- What is the optimal chunk size for your specific use case?
- Do you want to include a lot of information in the context window, or just the minimum necessary?
3. **Where to Chunk:**
- Should you chunk every N tokens or use specific separators?
- Is there a logical way to split the context that would aid the retrieval process?
4. **What to Return:**
- Should you return chunks across multiple documents or focus on top chunks within the same document?
- Should chunks be linked together with metadata to indicate common properties?
These considerations help in designing an efficient chunking strategy that aligns with your system's requirements
and goals.
-------------------------------
# Technical Patterns: Data Preparation - Embeddings
## What to Embed?
When preparing data for embedding, it's important to consider not just the text but also the metadata. This
approach can enhance the searchability and relevance of the data. Here are some examples:
### Examples
1. **Embedding Q&A Posts in a Forum**
- You might want to include the title of the posts, the original question, and the top answers.
- Additionally, if the posts are tagged by topic or keywords, these can be embedded as well.
2. **Embedding Product Specs**
- Besides embedding the text from product descriptions, you can add metadata such as color, size, and other
specifications to your embeddings.
By embedding both text and metadata, you can improve the ability to surface specific chunks or documents during a
search.
-------------------------------
**Technical Patterns: Data Preparation - Augmenting Content**
**What does “Augmenting content” mean?**
Augmenting content involves modifying the original material to make it more accessible and understandable for
systems that rely on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). These modifications can include changes in format,
wording, or the addition of descriptive elements like summaries or keywords.
**Example Approaches:**
1. **Make it a Guide:**
- Reformat the content into a step-by-step guide with clear headings and bullet points. This structure is more
easily understood by a Language Learning Model (LLM). GPT-4 can assist with this transformation using the right
prompts.
2. **Add Descriptive Metadata:**
- Incorporate keywords or text that users might search for when considering a specific product or service. This
helps in making the content more searchable and relevant.
3. **Multimodality:**
- Utilize models like Whisper or GPT-4V to convert audio or visual content into text. For instance, GPT-4V can
generate tags for images or describe slides, enhancing the content's accessibility and utility.
-------------------------------
**Technical Patterns: Input Processing**
This slide discusses methods for processing input data according to specific tasks, focusing on three main areas:
Q&A, content search, and database (DB) search.
1. **Q&A**:
- Uses a technique called HyDE, where a large language model (LLM) is asked to hypothetically answer a question.
This answer is then used to search the knowledge base (KB).
2. **Content Search**:
- Involves prompting the LLM to rephrase the input and optionally add more context to improve search results.
3. **DB Search**:
- Utilizes Named Entity Recognition (NER) to find relevant entities. These entities are then used for keyword
searches or to construct a search query.
The slide also highlights different output formats:
- **Embeddings**: Numerical representations of data, such as vectors (e.g., 0.983, 0.123, 0.289).
- **Query**: SQL-like statements for database searches (e.g., SELECT * from items).
- **Keywords**: Specific terms extracted from the input (e.g., "red," "summer").
**Best Practices**:
- Transform the input to match the content in the database.
- Use metadata to enhance user input.
**Common Pitfalls**:
- Avoid directly comparing input to the database without considering the specific requirements of the task.
-------------------------------
**Technical Patterns: Input Processing - Input Augmentation**
**What is input augmentation?**
Input augmentation involves transforming the input into something different, such as rephrasing it, splitting it
into several inputs, or expanding it. This process enhances performance by helping the language model (LLM) better
understand the user's intent.
**Example Approaches:**
1. **Query Expansion**
- Rephrase the query to make it more descriptive. This helps the LLM grasp the context and details more
effectively.
2. **HyDE**
- Hypothetically answer the question and use that answer to search the knowledge base (KB). This approach can
provide more relevant results by anticipating possible answers.
3. **Splitting a Query in N**
- When a user query contains multiple questions or intents, consider dividing it into several queries. This
ensures each part is addressed thoroughly.
4. **Fallback**
- Implement a flow where the LLM can ask for clarification if the original query lacks sufficient information.
This is particularly useful when using tools that require precise input.
*Note: GPT-4 can perform these tasks with the appropriate prompt.*
-------------------------------
Technical Patterns: Input Processing - NER
**Why use NER?**
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a technique used to extract relevant entities from input data. This process is
beneficial for creating more deterministic search queries, especially when the scope is very constrained. By
identifying specific entities, such as names, dates, or locations, NER helps in refining and improving the accuracy
of searches.
**Example: Searching for Movies**
Consider a structured database containing metadata on movies. By using NER, you can extract specific entities like
genre, actors, or directors' names from a user's query. This information can then be used to search the database
more effectively.
**Note:** After extracting the relevant entities, you can use exact values or embeddings to enhance the search
process.
-------------------------------
Technical Patterns: Retrieval
This diagram illustrates a retrieval process using technical patterns. The process begins with three types of
input: embeddings, queries, and keywords.
1. **Embeddings**: These are numerical representations (e.g., 0.983, 0.123, 0.289) used for semantic search. They
are processed through a vector database (vector DB).
2. **Query**: This involves structured queries (e.g., "SELECT * from items...") that interact with a relational or
NoSQL database.
3. **Keywords**: Simple search terms like "red" and "summer" are also used with the relational or NoSQL database.
The results from both the vector and relational/NoSQL databases are combined. The initial results undergo a
re-ranking process to ensure accuracy and relevance, leading to the final result, which is then used to generate
output.
**Best Practices**:
- Combine semantic search with deterministic queries for more effective retrieval.
- Cache outputs where possible to improve efficiency.
**Common Pitfalls**:
- Incorrect element comparison during text similarity checks can occur, highlighting the importance of re-ranking
to ensure accurate results.
-------------------------------
Technical Patterns: Retrieval - Search
**How to search?**
There are various approaches to searching, which depend on the use case and the existing system. Here are three
main methods:
1. **Semantic Search**:
- This method uses embeddings to perform searches.
- By comparing embeddings with the data in your database, you can find the most similar matches.
2. **Keyword Search**:
- If you have specific entities or keywords extracted, you can search for these directly in your database.
3. **Search Query**:
- Based on extracted entities or direct user input, you can construct search queries (such as SQL or Cypher) to
search your database.
Additionally, you can use a hybrid approach by combining several methods. This can involve performing multiple
searches in parallel or in sequence, or searching for keywords along with their embeddings.
-------------------------------
**Technical Patterns: Retrieval - Multi-step Retrieval**
**What is multi-step retrieval?**
Multi-step retrieval involves performing several actions to obtain the necessary information to generate an answer.
This approach is useful when a single step is insufficient to gather all required data.
**Things to Consider**
1. **Framework to be Used:**
- When multiple steps are needed, decide whether to manage this process yourself or use a framework to simplify
the task.
2. **Cost & Latency:**
- Performing multiple steps can significantly increase both latency and cost.
- To mitigate latency, consider executing actions in parallel.
3. **Chain of Thought:**
- Use a chain of thought approach to guide the process. Break down instructions into clear steps, providing
guidelines on whether to continue, stop, or take alternative actions.
- This method is particularly useful for tasks that must be performed sequentially, such as "if this didn’t
work, then do this."
-------------------------------
**Technical Patterns: Retrieval - Re-ranking**
**What is re-ranking?**
Re-ranking involves re-ordering the results of a retrieval process to highlight more relevant outcomes. This is
especially crucial in semantic searches, where understanding the context and meaning of queries is important.
**Example Approaches**
1. **Rule-based Re-ranking**
- This approach uses metadata to rank results by relevance. For instance, you might consider the recency of
documents, tags, or specific keywords in the title to determine their importance.
2. **Re-ranking Algorithms**
- There are various algorithms available for re-ranking based on specific use cases. Examples include BERT-based
re-rankers, cross-encoder re-ranking, and TF-IDF algorithms. These methods apply different techniques to assess and
order the relevance of search results.
-------------------------------
**Technical Patterns: Answer Generation**
This diagram illustrates the process of generating answers using a language model (LLM). Here's a breakdown of the
components and concepts:
1. **Process Flow:**
- A piece of content is retrieved and used to create a prompt.
- This prompt is fed into the LLM, which processes it to generate a final result.
- The user then sees this final result.
2. **Best Practices:**
- It's important to evaluate performance after each experiment. This helps determine if exploring other methods
is beneficial.
- Implementing guardrails can be useful to ensure the model's outputs are safe and reliable.
3. **Common Pitfalls:**
- Avoid jumping straight to fine-tuning the model without considering other approaches that might be more
effective or efficient.
- Pay close attention to how the model is prompted, as this can significantly impact the quality of the output.
By following these guidelines, you can optimize the use of LLMs for generating accurate and useful answers.
-------------------------------
# Technical Patterns: Answer Generation - Context Window
## How to Manage Context?
When generating answers using a context window, it's important to consider several factors based on your specific
use case. Here are key points to keep in mind:
### Things to Consider
- **Context Window Max Size:**
- The context window has a maximum size, so overloading it with too much content is not ideal.
- In conversational scenarios, the conversation itself becomes part of the context, contributing to the overall
size.
- **Cost & Latency vs. Accuracy:**
- Including more context can lead to increased latency and higher costs due to the additional input tokens
required.
- Conversely, using less context might reduce accuracy.
- **"Lost in the Middle" Problem:**
- When the context is too extensive, language models may overlook or forget information that is "in the middle"
of the content, potentially missing important details.
-------------------------------
**Technical Patterns: Answer Generation Optimisation**
**How to optimise?**
When optimising a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application, there are several methods to consider. These
methods should be tried sequentially from left to right, and multiple approaches can be iterated if necessary.
1. **Prompt Engineering**
- Experiment with different prompts at each stage of the process to achieve the desired input format or generate
relevant output.
- Guide the model through multiple steps to reach the final outcome.
2. **Few-shot Examples**
- If the model's behavior is not as expected, provide examples of the desired outcome.
- Include sample user inputs and the expected processing format to guide the model.
3. **Fine-tuning**
- If a few examples are insufficient, consider fine-tuning the model with more examples for each process step.
- Fine-tuning can help achieve a specific input processing or output format.
-------------------------------
Technical Patterns: Answer Generation - Safety Checks
**Why include safety checks?**
Safety checks are crucial because providing a model with supposedly relevant context does not guarantee that the
generated answer will be truthful or accurate. Depending on the use case, it is important to double-check the
information to ensure reliability.
**RAGAS Score Evaluation Framework**
The RAGAS score is an evaluation framework that assesses both the generation and retrieval aspects of answer
generation:
- **Generation:**
- **Faithfulness:** This measures how factually accurate the generated answer is.
- **Answer Relevancy:** This evaluates how relevant the generated answer is to the question.
- **Retrieval:**
- **Context Precision:** This assesses the signal-to-noise ratio of the retrieved context, ensuring that the
information is precise.
- **Context Recall:** This checks if all relevant information required to answer the question is retrieved.
By using this framework, one can systematically evaluate and improve the quality of generated answers.

Overview
Evaluation is the process of validating
and testing the outputs that your LLM
applications are producing. Having
strong evaluations (“evals”) will mean a
more stable, reliable application which is
resilient to code and model changes.
Example use cases
- Quantify a solution’s reliability
- Monitor application performance in
production
Test for regressions

An evaluation, or "eval," involves a question and a correct answer, known as the ground truth. In this example, the
question posed is, "What is the population of Canada?"
The process begins with a person asking this question. The language model (LLM) initially does not know the answer
and decides to use a tool to find it. The LLM takes the action of searching, with the input being the question
about Canada's population.
The search tool then provides the answer: "The current population of Canada is 39,566,248 as of Tuesday, May 23,
2023." This result matches the actual result expected, which is that there are 39,566,248 people in Canada as of
2023.
This example illustrates how evaluations are used to verify the accuracy of information provided by a language
model.
This slide provides an example of an evaluation process, often referred to as "evals." The purpose of evals is to
compare a predicted answer to a known correct answer, called the "ground truth," to determine if they match.
In this example, the question posed is: "What is the population of Canada?" The ground truth states that the
population of Canada in 2023 is 39,566,248 people. The predicted answer is: "There are 39,566,248 people in Canada
as of 2023."
Since the predicted answer matches the ground truth, the evaluation is successful, as indicated by a checkmark.
This process is crucial for verifying the accuracy of predictions in various applications.

Subjective evaluations
Building up a good scorecard for automated testing beneﬁts from a few rounds of detailed human
review so we can learn what is valuable.
A policy of “show rather than tell” is also advised for GPT-4, so include examples of what a 1, 3 and
8 out of 10 look like so the model can appreciate the spread.
Example
scorecard
You are a helpful evaluation assistant who grades how well the Assistant has answered the customer’s query.
You will assess each submission against these metrics, please think through these step by step:
-
relevance: Grade how relevant the search content is to the question from 1 to 5 // 5 being highly relevant and 1
being
not relevant at all.
- credibility: Grade how credible the sources provided are from 1 to 5 // 5 being an established newspaper,
-
government agency or large company and 1 being unreferenced.
result: Assess whether the question is correct given only the content returned from the search and the user’s
question // acceptable values are “correct” or “incorrect”
You will output this as a JSON document: {relevance: integer, credibility: integer, result: string}
User: What is the population of Canada?
Assistant: Canada's population was estimated at 39,858,480 on April 1, 2023 by Statistics Canada.
Evaluation: {relevance: 5, credibility: 5, result: correct}

-------------------------------
Example framework
Your evaluations can be grouped up into test suites called runs and executed in a batch to test
the eﬀectiveness of your system.
Each run should have its contents logged and stored at the most granular level possible
(“tracing”) so you can investigate failure reasons, make tweaks and then rerun your evals.

This diagram illustrates a framework for processing a return request using a language model (LLM) system. Here's a
breakdown of the process:
1. **User Input**: The user wants to return a T-shirt purchased on Amazon on March 3rd.
2. **Router**: The initial input is processed by a router LLM, which determines the nature of the request. The
expected and predicted outcomes are both "return," and the process passes this evaluation.
3. **Return Assistant**: The request is then handled by a return assistant LLM. It interacts with a knowledge base
to verify the return policy.
4. **Knowledge Base**: The system checks the return policy, confirming that the item is eligible for return within
14 days of purchase. The expected and predicted outcomes are "return_policy," and this step also passes.
5. **Response to User**: The system responds to the user, confirming that the return can be processed because it is
within the 14-day window.
6. **Evaluation**: The response is evaluated for adherence to guidelines, scoring 5 for politeness, 4 for
coherence, and 4 for relevancy, resulting in a pass.
The framework uses both component evaluations (red dashed lines) and subjective evaluations (orange dashed lines)
to ensure the process is accurate and user-friendly.

Best practices
Log everything
●
Evals need test cases - log everything as you develop so you can mine your logs for good eval cases
Create a feedback loop
●
●
Build evals into your application so you can quickly run them, iterate and rerun to see the impact
Evals also provide a useful structure for few-shot or ﬁne-tuning examples when optimizing
Employ expert labellers who know the process
● Use experts to help create your eval cases - these need to be as lifelike as possible
Evaluate early and often
●
Evals are something you should build as soon as you have your ﬁrst functioning prompt - you won’t be
able to optimize without this baseline, so build it early
● Making evals early also forces you to engage with what a good response looks like
1. **Log Everything**
- It's important to log all test cases during development. This allows you to mine your logs for effective
evaluation cases.
2. **Create a Feedback Loop**
- Integrate evaluations into your application to quickly run, iterate, and rerun them to observe impacts.
- Evaluations provide a useful structure for few-shot or fine-tuning examples during optimization.
3. **Employ Expert Labelers Who Know the Process**
- Use experts to help create evaluation cases, ensuring they are as realistic as possible.
4. **Evaluate Early and Often**
- Build evaluations as soon as you have a functioning prompt. This baseline is crucial for optimization.
- Early evaluations help you understand what a good response looks like, facilitating better engagement.

## Overview
Evaluation is the process of validating and testing the outputs that your Large Language Model (LLM) applications
are producing. Strong evaluations, referred to as "evals," contribute to creating a more stable and reliable
application that can withstand changes in code and model updates.
### Example Use Cases
- **Quantify a solution’s reliability**: Measure how dependable your application is.
- **Monitor application performance in production**: Keep track of how well your application performs in real-world
scenarios.
- **Test for regressions**: Ensure that new updates do not negatively impact existing functionality.
### What We’ll Cover
- **What are evals**: Understanding the concept and importance of evaluations.
- **Technical patterns**: Exploring common methods and strategies used in evaluations.
- **Example framework**: Providing a structured approach to implementing evaluations.
- **Best practices**: Sharing tips and guidelines for effective evaluations.
- **Resources**: Offering additional materials for further learning and exploration.
-------------------------------
**Technical Patterns**
This slide outlines three types of evaluation methods used in technical assessments:
1. **Metric-based Evaluations**:
- These evaluations use comparison metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE.
- They provide a score that helps in filtering and ranking results, making it easier to assess the quality of
outputs quantitatively.
2. **Component Evaluations**:
- This method involves comparing the ground truth to predictions.
- It results in a simple Pass/Fail outcome, which is useful for determining whether specific components meet the
required standards.
3. **Subjective Evaluations**:
- These evaluations rely on a scorecard to assess outputs subjectively.
- The scorecard can also include a Pass/Fail option, allowing for a more nuanced evaluation that considers
qualitative aspects.

ROUGE is a common metric for evaluating machine summarizations of text. It is specifically used to assess the
quality of summaries by comparing them to reference summaries. The slide provides an example of how ROUGE is
applied:
- **Original Text**: This is a detailed description of OpenAI's mission, emphasizing the development of artificial
general intelligence (AGI) that benefits humanity. It highlights the importance of safety, broad distribution of
benefits, and avoiding harmful uses or power concentration.
- **Machine Summary**: This is a condensed version of the original text. It focuses on ensuring AGI is safe and
accessible, avoiding harm and power concentration, and promoting research and collaboration in AI.
- **ROUGE Score**: The score given is 0.51162, which quantifies the similarity between the machine-generated
summary and the original text. A higher score indicates a closer match to the reference summary.
Overall, ROUGE helps in evaluating how well a machine-generated summary captures the essence of the original text.
-------------------------------
# Technical Patterns: Metric-based Evaluations
The slide discusses the BLEU score, a standard metric used to evaluate machine translation tasks. BLEU stands for
Bilingual Evaluation Understudy and is a method for assessing the quality of text that has been machine-translated
from one language to another.
### Key Elements:
- **BLEU**: This is a metric specifically designed for evaluating translation tasks. It compares the
machine-generated translation to one or more reference translations.
- **Original Text**: The example given is in Welsh: "Y gwir oedd doedden nhw ddim yn dweud celwyddau wedi'r cwbl."
- **Reference Translation**: This is the human-generated translation used as a standard for comparison: "The truth
was they were not telling lies after all."
- **Predicted Translation**: This is the translation produced by the machine: "The truth was they weren't telling
lies after all."
- **BLEU Score**: The score for this translation is 0.39938. This score indicates how closely the machine
translation matches the reference translation, with a higher score representing a closer match.
The BLEU score is widely used in the field of natural language processing to provide a quantitative measure of
translation quality.

Technical Patterns: Metric-based Evaluations
**What they’re good for:**
- **Starting Point**: They provide a good starting point for evaluating a new solution, helping to establish
initial benchmarks.
- **Automated Testing**: These evaluations serve as a useful yardstick for automated testing, particularly in
determining if a change has caused a significant performance shift.
- **Cost-Effective**: They are cheap and fast, making them accessible for quick assessments.
**What to be aware of:**
- **Context Specificity**: These evaluations are not tailored to specific contexts, which can limit their
effectiveness in certain situations.
- **Sophistication Needs**: Most customers require more sophisticated evaluations before moving to production,
indicating that metric-based evaluations might not be sufficient on their own for final decision-making.
-------------------------------
**Technical Patterns: Component Evaluations**
Component evaluations, also known as "unit tests," focus on assessing a single input/output of an application. The
goal is to verify that each component functions correctly in isolation by comparing the input to a predefined ideal
result, known as the ground truth.
**Process Overview:**
1. **Input Question:**
- The process begins with a question: "What is the population of Canada?"
2. **Agent's Role:**
- The agent receives the question and processes it. The agent's thought process is: "I don’t know. I should use
a tool."
- The agent decides on an action: "Search."
- The action input is the original question: "What is the population of Canada?"
3. **Search Component:**
- The search component is tasked with finding the answer. It retrieves the information: "The current population
of Canada is 39,566,248 as of Tuesday, May 23, 2023…."
4. **Evaluation Steps:**
- **Correct Action Check:** Is the agent's decision to search the correct action?
- **Exact Match Comparison:** Does the retrieved answer match the expected result exactly?
- **Contextual Relevance:** Does the answer use the context provided in the question?
- **Number Extraction and Comparison:** Extract numbers from both the expected and retrieved answers and compare
them for accuracy.
5. **Final Output:**
- The final output is the verified answer: "There are 39,566,248 people in Canada as of 2023."
This process ensures that each component of the application is functioning correctly and producing accurate results
by systematically evaluating each step against the ground truth.
-------------------------------
**Technical Patterns: Subjective Evaluations**
Building an effective scorecard for automated testing is enhanced by incorporating detailed human reviews. This
process helps identify what is truly valuable. The approach of "show rather than tell" is recommended for GPT-4,
meaning that examples of scores like 1, 3, and 8 out of 10 should be provided to help the model understand the
range.
**Example Scorecard:**
- **Role**: You are an evaluation assistant assessing how well the Assistant has answered a customer's query.
- **Metrics for Assessment**:
- **Relevance**: Rate the relevance of the search content to the question on a scale from 1 to 5, where 5 is
highly relevant and 1 is not relevant at all.
- **Credibility**: Rate the credibility of the sources from 1 to 5, where 5 is an established newspaper,
government agency, or large company, and 1 is unreferenced.
- **Result**: Determine if the question is answered correctly based on the search content and the user's
question. Acceptable values are "correct" or "incorrect."
- **Output Format**: Provide the evaluation as a JSON document with fields for relevance, credibility, and result.
**Example Evaluation**:
- **User Query**: "What is the population of Canada?"
- **Assistant's Response**: "Canada's population was estimated at 39,858,480 on April 1, 2023, by Statistics
Canada."
- **Evaluation**: `{relevance: 5, credibility: 5, result: correct}`
This structured approach ensures clarity and consistency in evaluating the performance of automated systems.
-------------------------------
**Example Framework**
This framework outlines a method for evaluating the effectiveness of a system by grouping evaluations into test
suites called "runs." These runs are executed in batches, and each run's contents are logged and stored at a
detailed level, known as "tracing." This allows for investigation of failures, making adjustments, and rerunning
evaluations.
The table provides a summary of different runs:
- **Run ID 1**:
- Model: gpt-3.5-turbo
- Score: 28/50
- Annotation Feedback: 18 incorrect with correct search results, 4 incorrect searches
- Changes: N/A
- **Run ID 2**:
- Model: gpt-4
- Score: 36/50
- Annotation Feedback: 10 incorrect with correct search results, 4 incorrect searches
- Changes: Model updated to GPT-4
- **Run ID 3**:
- Model: gpt-3.5-turbo
- Score: 34/50
- Annotation Feedback: 12 incorrect with correct search results, 4 incorrect searches
- Changes: Added few-shot examples
- **Run ID 4**:
- Model: gpt-3.5-turbo
- Score: 42/50
- Annotation Feedback: 8 incorrect with correct search results
- Changes: Added metadata to search, Prompt engineering for Answer step
- **Run ID 5**:
- Model: gpt-3.5-turbo
- Score: 48/50
- Annotation Feedback: 2 incorrect with correct search results
- Changes: Prompt engineering to Answer step
This framework emphasizes the importance of detailed logging and iterative improvements to enhance system
performance.

model
Fine-tuning a model consists of training the
model to follow a set of given input/output
examples.
This will teach the model to behave in a
certain way when confronted with a similar
input in the future.
We recommend using 50-100 examples
even if the minimum is 10.

Fine-tuning is a process in machine learning where a pre-existing model, known as a public model, is further
trained using specific training data. This involves adjusting the model to follow a set of given input/output
examples. The goal is to teach the model to respond in a particular way when it encounters similar inputs in the
future.
The diagram illustrates this process: starting with a public model, training data is used in a training phase to
produce a fine-tuned model. This refined model is better suited to specific tasks or datasets.
It is recommended to use 50-100 examples for effective fine-tuning, although the minimum requirement is 10
examples. This ensures the model learns adequately from the examples provided.

-------------------------------
Best practices
Curate examples carefully
Datasets can be diﬃcult to build, start
small and invest intentionally.
Optimize for fewer high-quality
training examples.
● Consider “prompt baking”, or using a basic
prompt to generate your initial examples
● If your conversations are multi-turn, ensure
your examples are representative
● Collect examples to target issues detected
in evaluation
● Consider the balance & diversity of data
● Make sure your examples contain all the
information needed in the response
Iterate on hyperparameters
Establish a baseline
Start with the defaults and adjust
based on performance.
● If the model does not appear to converge,
increase the learning rate multiplier
● If the model does not follow the training
data as much as expected increase the
number of epochs
● If the model becomes less diverse than
expected decrease the # of epochs by 1-2
Automate your feedback
pipeline
Introduce automated evaluations to
highlight potential problem cases to
clean up and use as training data.
Consider the G-Eval approach of
using GPT-4 to perform automated
testing using a scorecard.
Often users start with a
zero-shot or few-shot prompt to
build a baseline evaluation

**Epochs**
- An epoch refers to one complete cycle through the training dataset.
- For datasets with hundreds of thousands of examples, it is recommended to use fewer epochs (one or two) to
prevent overfitting.
- Default setting is auto, with a standard of 4 epochs.
**Batch Size**
- This is the number of training examples used to train in a single forward and backward pass.
- Larger batch sizes are generally more effective for larger datasets.
- The default batch size is approximately 0.2% of the total number of training examples (N), with a maximum of 256.
**Learning Rate Multiplier**
- This is a scaling factor for the original learning rate.
- Experimentation with values between 0.02 and 0.2 is recommended.
- Larger learning rates often yield better results with larger batch sizes.
- Default values are 0.05, 0.1, or 0.2, depending on the final batch size.

**Overview**
Fine-tuning involves adjusting the parameters of pre-trained models on a specific dataset or task. This process
enhances the model's ability to generate more accurate and relevant responses for the given context by adapting it
to the nuances and specific requirements of the task at hand.
**Example Use Cases:**
- Generate output in a consistent format.
- Process input by following specific instructions.

-------------------------------
When to Fine-Tune
**Good for:**
- **Following a given format or tone for the output:** Fine-tuning is effective when you need the model to adhere
to a specific style or structure in its responses.
- **Processing the input following specific, complex instructions:** It helps in handling detailed and intricate
instructions accurately.
- **Improving latency:** Fine-tuning can enhance the speed of the model's responses.
- **Reducing token usage:** It can optimize the model to use fewer tokens, making it more efficient.
**Not good for:**
- **Teaching the model new knowledge:** Fine-tuning is not suitable for adding new information to the model.
Instead, use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or custom models.
- **Performing well at multiple, unrelated tasks:** For diverse tasks, it's better to use prompt engineering or
create multiple fine-tuned models.
- **Including up-to-date content in responses:** Fine-tuning is not ideal for ensuring the model has the latest
information. RAG is recommended for this purpose.
-------------------------------
**Preparing the Dataset**
This slide provides guidance on preparing a dataset for training a chatbot model. It includes an example format
using JSONL (JSON Lines) to structure the data. The example shows a conversation with three roles:
1. **System**: Sets the context by describing the chatbot as "Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."
2. **User**: Asks a question, "What's the capital of France?"
3. **Assistant**: Responds with a sarcastic answer, "Paris, as if everyone doesn't know that already."
Key recommendations for dataset preparation include:
- Use a set of instructions and prompts that have proven effective for the model before fine-tuning. These should
be included in every training example.
- If you choose to shorten instructions or prompts, be aware that more training examples may be needed to achieve
good results.
- It is recommended to use 50-100 examples, even though the minimum required is 10.
-------------------------------
**Best Practices**
1. **Curate Examples Carefully**
- Building datasets can be challenging, so start small and focus on high-quality examples.
- Use "prompt baking" to generate initial examples.
- Ensure multi-turn conversations are well-represented.
- Collect examples to address issues found during evaluation.
- Balance and diversify your data.
- Ensure examples contain all necessary information for responses.
2. **Iterate on Hyperparameters**
- Begin with default settings and adjust based on performance.
- Increase the learning rate multiplier if the model doesn't converge.
- Increase the number of epochs if the model doesn't follow training data closely.
- Decrease the number of epochs by 1-2 if the model becomes less diverse.
3. **Establish a Baseline**
- Start with zero-shot or few-shot prompts to create a baseline before fine-tuning.
4. **Automate Your Feedback Pipeline**
- Use automated evaluations to identify and clean up problem cases for training data.
- Consider using the G-Eval approach with GPT-4 for automated testing with a scorecard.
5. **Optimize for Latency and Token Efficiency**
- After establishing a baseline, consider fine-tuning with GPT-3.5 for similar performance at lower cost and
latency.
- Experiment with reducing or removing system instructions in subsequent fine-tuned versions.

value of your order”
KnowledgeBase / Externalsources
RAG stands for "Retrieve information to Augment the model’s knowledge and Generate the output." This process
involves using a language model (LLM) to enhance its responses by accessing external information sources.
Here's how it works:
. **User Query**: A user asks a question, such as "What is your return policy?"
. **LLM Processing**: The language model receives the question and initiates a search for relevant information.
. **Information Retrieval**: The LLM accesses a knowledge base or external sources to find the necessary details.
In this example, the information retrieved includes:
- Total refunds available from 0 to 14 days.
- 50% value vouchers for returns between 14 to 30 days.
- A $5 discount on the next order for returns after 30 days.
. **Response Generation**: The LLM uses the retrieved information to generate a coherent response for the user. For
instance, it might say, "You can get a full refund up to 14 days after the purchase, then up to 30 days you would
get a voucher for half the value of your order."
This method allows the model to provide accurate and up-to-date answers by leveraging external data sources.

What to embed?
Depending on your use caseyou might not want just toembed the text in thedocuments but metadata as well- anything
that will make it easierto surface this speciﬁc chunk ordocument when performing asearch
Examples
Embedding Q&A posts in a forum
You might want to embed the title of the posts,the text of the original question and the content ofthe top answers.
Additionally, if the posts are tagged by topic orwith keywords, you can embed those too.
Embedding product specs
In additional to embedding the text contained indocuments describing the products, you mightwant to add metadata
that you have on theproduct such as the color, size, etc. in yourembeddings.

keywords.
Example approaches
Make it a guide*

What is multi-step retrieval?
In some cases, there might beseveral actions to be performed toget the required information togenerate an answer.
Things to consider
●
Framework to be used:
○ When there are multiple steps to perform,consider whether you want to handle thisyourself or use a framework to
make it easier
●

○
○
Performing multiple steps at the retrievalstage can increase latency and costsigniﬁcantly
Consider performing actions in parallel toreduce latency
●
Chain of Thought:
○
○
Guide the assistant with the chain of thoughtapproach: break down instructions intoseveral steps, with clear
guidelines onwhether to continue, stop or do somethingelse.This is more appropriate when tasks need tobe performed
sequentially - for example: “ifthis didn’t work, then do this”

Technical patterns
Retrieval: re-ranking
What is re-ranking?
Example approaches
Re-ranking means re-ordering theresults of the retrieval process tosurface more relevant results.
This is particularly important whendoing semantic searches.
Rule-based re-ranking
You can use metadata to rank results by relevance. Forexample, you can look at the recency of the documents,
attags, speciﬁc keywords in the title, etc.

How to manage context?
Depending on your use case, there areseveral things to consider whenincluding retrieved content into thecontext
window to generate an answer.
Things to consider
●
Context window max size:
○
○
There is a maximum size, so putting toomuch content is not ideal
In conversation use cases, theconversation will be part of the contextas well and will add to that size
●
Cost & Latency vs Accuracy:
○ More context results in increased
latency and additional costs since therewill be more input tokens
Less context might also result indecreased accuracy

○ When there is too much context, LLMstend to forget the text “in the middle” ofthe content and might look over
someimportant information.

Depending on the use case, youmight want to double-check.
Example evaluation framework: RAGAS
-------------------------------
-------------------------------
**Overview**
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language models by integrating them with a retrieval system. This
combination allows the model to access external knowledge sources, resulting in more accurate and contextually
relevant responses.
**Example Use Cases:**
- Providing answers with up-to-date information
- Generating contextual responses
**What We’ll Cover:**
- Technical patterns
- Best practices
- Common pitfalls
- Resources
-------------------------------
**Technical Patterns**
This image outlines four key technical patterns involved in data processing and answer generation:
. **Data Preparation**
- **Chunking**: Breaking down data into smaller, manageable pieces.
- **Embeddings**: Converting data into numerical formats that can be easily processed by machine learning
models.
- **Augmenting Content**: Enhancing data with additional information to improve its quality or usefulness.
. **Input Processing**
- **Input Augmentation**: Adding extra data or features to the input to improve model performance.
- **NER (Named Entity Recognition)**: Identifying and classifying key entities in the text, such as names,
dates, and locations.
- **Embeddings**: Similar to data preparation, embeddings are used here to represent input data in a format
suitable for processing.
. **Retrieval**
- **Search**: Locating relevant information from a dataset.
- **Multi-step Retrieval**: Using multiple steps or methods to refine the search process and improve accuracy.
- **Re-ranking**: Adjusting the order of retrieved results based on relevance or other criteria.
. **Answer Generation**
- **Context Window**: Using a specific portion of data to generate relevant answers.
- **Optimisation**: Improving the efficiency and accuracy of the answer generation process.
- **Safety Checks**: Ensuring that the generated answers are safe and appropriate for use.
-------------------------------
**Technical Patterns: Data Preparation**
This presentation focuses on the process of preparing data for easier consumption by large language models (LLMs).
. **Content Chunking**:
- Documents are divided into smaller, manageable pieces. This makes it easier for LLMs to
process the information.
. **Embeddings**:
- Each chunk of content is converted into embeddings, which are numerical representations (e.g., 0.983, 0.123,
0.289) that capture the semantic meaning of the text. These embeddings are then stored in a knowledge base.
. **Augmenting Content**:
- Content can be enhanced using LLMs. For example, GPT-4 can be used to rephrase, summarize, and generate bullet
points from the text.
. **Best Practices**:
- Pre-process content for LLM consumption by adding summaries and headers for each part.
- Curate relevant data sources to ensure quality and relevance.
. **Common Pitfalls**:
- Avoid having too much low-quality content.
- Ensure documents are not too large, as this can hinder processing efficiency.
This approach helps in organizing and optimizing data for better performance and understanding by LLMs.
-------------------------------
**Technical Patterns: Data Preparation - Chunking**
**Why Chunking?**
Chunking is a technique used when your system doesn't need entire documents to provide relevant answers. By
breaking documents into smaller pieces, you can make data easier to process, which reduces cost and latency. This
approach is beneficial for systems that need to handle large volumes of data efficiently. Other methods for data
preparation include using graphs or map-reduce.
**Things to Consider**
. **Overlap:**
- Should chunks be independent or overlap with one another?
- If they overlap, by how much should they do so?
. **Size of Chunks:**
- What is the optimal chunk size for your specific use case?
- Do you want to include a lot of information in the context window, or just the minimum necessary?
. **Where to Chunk:**
- Should you chunk every N tokens or use specific separators?
- Is there a logical way to split the context that would aid the retrieval process?
. **What to Return:**
- Should you return chunks across multiple documents or focus on top chunks within the same document?
- Should chunks be linked together with metadata to indicate common properties?
These considerations help in designing an efficient chunking strategy that aligns with your system's requirements
and goals.
-------------------------------
# Technical Patterns: Data Preparation - Embeddings
## What to Embed?
When preparing data for embedding, it's important to consider not just the text but also the metadata. This
approach can enhance the searchability and relevance of the data. Here are some examples:
### Examples
. **Embedding Q&A Posts in a Forum**
- You might want to include the title of the posts, the original question, and the top answers.
- Additionally, if the posts are tagged by topic or keywords, these can be embedded as well.
. **Embedding Product Specs**
- Besides embedding the text from product descriptions, you can add metadata such as color, size, and other
specifications to your embeddings.
By embedding both text and metadata, you can improve the ability to surface specific chunks or documents during a
search.
-------------------------------
**Technical Patterns: Data Preparation - Augmenting Content**
**What does “Augmenting content” mean?**
Augmenting content involves modifying the original material to make it more accessible and understandable for
systems that rely on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). These modifications can include changes in format,
wording, or the addition of descriptive elements like summaries or keywords.
**Example Approaches:**
. **Make it a Guide:**
- Reformat the content into a step-by-step guide with clear headings and bullet points. This structure is more
easily understood by a Language Learning Model (LLM). GPT-4 can assist with this transformation using the right
prompts.
. **Add Descriptive Metadata:**
- Incorporate keywords or text that users might search for when considering a specific product or service. This
helps in making the content more searchable and relevant.
. **Multimodality:**
- Utilize models like Whisper or GPT-4V to convert audio or visual content into text. For instance, GPT-4V can
generate tags for images or describe slides, enhancing the content's accessibility and utility.
-------------------------------
**Technical Patterns: Input Processing**
methods for processing input data according to specific tasks, focusing on three main areas: Q&A, content search,
and database (DB) search.
. **Q&A**:
- Uses a technique called HyDE, where a large language model (LLM) is asked to hypothetically answer a
question. This answer is then used to search the knowledge base (KB).
. **Content Search**:
- Involves prompting the LLM to rephrase the input and optionally add more context to improve search results.
. **DB Search**:
- Utilizes Named Entity Recognition (NER) to find relevant entities. These entities are then used for keyword
searches or to construct a search query.
highlights different output formats:
- **Embeddings**: Numerical representations of data, such as vectors (e.g., 0.983, 0.123, 0.289).
- **Query**: SQL-like statements for database searches (e.g., SELECT * from items).
- **Keywords**: Specific terms extracted from the input (e.g., "red," "summer").
**Best Practices**:
- Transform the input to match the content in the database.
- Use metadata to enhance user input.
**Common Pitfalls**:
- Avoid directly comparing input to the database without considering the specific requirements of the task.
-------------------------------
**Technical Patterns: Input Processing - Input Augmentation**
**What is input augmentation?**
Input augmentation involves transforming the input into something different, such as rephrasing it, splitting it
into several inputs, or expanding it. This process enhances performance by helping the language model (LLM) better
understand the user's intent.
**Example Approaches:**
. **Query Expansion**
- Rephrase the query to make it more descriptive. This helps the LLM grasp the context and details more
effectively.
. **HyDE**
- Hypothetically answer the question and use that answer to search the knowledge base (KB). This approach can
provide more relevant results by anticipating possible answers.
. **Splitting a Query in N**
- When a user query contains multiple questions or intents, consider dividing it into several queries. This
ensures each part is addressed thoroughly.
. **Fallback**
- Implement a flow where the LLM can ask for clarification if the original query lacks sufficient information.
This is particularly useful when using tools that require precise input.
*Note: GPT-4 can perform these tasks with the appropriate prompt.*
-------------------------------
Technical Patterns: Input Processing - NER
**Why use NER?**
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a technique used to extract relevant entities from input data. This process is
beneficial for creating more deterministic search queries, especially when the scope is very constrained. By
identifying specific entities, such as names, dates, or locations, NER helps in refining and improving the accuracy
of searches.
**Example: Searching for Movies**
Consider a structured database containing metadata on movies. By using NER, you can extract specific entities like
genre, actors, or directors' names from a user's query. This information can then be used to search the database
more effectively.
**Note:** After extracting the relevant entities, you can use exact values or embeddings to enhance the search
process.
-------------------------------
Technical Patterns: Retrieval
This diagram illustrates a retrieval process using technical patterns. The process begins with three types of
input: embeddings, queries, and keywords.
. **Embeddings**: These are numerical representations (e.g., 0.983, 0.123, 0.289) used for semantic search. They
are processed through a vector database (vector DB).
. **Query**: This involves structured queries (e.g., "SELECT * from items...") that interact with a relational or
NoSQL database.
. **Keywords**: Simple search terms like "red" and "summer" are also used with the relational or NoSQL database.
The results from both the vector and relational/NoSQL databases are combined. The initial results undergo a
re-ranking process to ensure accuracy and relevance, leading to the final result, which is then used to generate
output.
**Best Practices**:
- Combine semantic search with deterministic queries for more effective retrieval.
- Cache outputs where possible to improve efficiency.
**Common Pitfalls**:
- Incorrect element comparison during text similarity checks can occur, highlighting the importance of re-ranking
to ensure accurate results.
-------------------------------
Technical Patterns: Retrieval - Search
**How to search?**
There are various approaches to searching, which depend on the use case and the existing system. Here are three
main methods:
. **Semantic Search**:
- This method uses embeddings to perform searches.
- By comparing embeddings with the data in your database,
you can find the most similar matches.
. **Keyword Search**:
- If you have specific entities or keywords extracted, you can search for these directly in your database.
. **Search Query**:
- Based on extracted entities or direct user input, you can construct search queries (such as SQL or Cypher) to
search your database.
Additionally, you can use a hybrid approach by combining several methods. This can involve performing multiple
searches in parallel or in sequence, or searching for keywords along with their embeddings.
-------------------------------
**Technical Patterns: Retrieval - Multi-step Retrieval**
**What is multi-step retrieval?**
Multi-step retrieval involves performing several actions to obtain the necessary information to generate an answer.
This approach is useful when a single step is insufficient to gather all required data.
**Things to Consider**
. **Framework to be Used:**
- When multiple steps are needed, decide whether to manage this process yourself or use a framework to simplify
the task.
. **Cost & Latency:**
- Performing multiple steps can significantly increase both latency and cost.
- To mitigate latency, consider executing actions in parallel.
. **Chain of Thought:**
- Use a chain of thought approach to guide the process. Break down instructions into clear steps, providing
guidelines on whether to continue, stop, or take alternative actions.
- This method is particularly useful for tasks that must be performed sequentially, such as "if this didn’t
work, then do this."
-------------------------------
**Technical Patterns: Retrieval - Re-ranking**
**What is re-ranking?**
Re-ranking involves re-ordering the results of a retrieval process to highlight more relevant outcomes. This is
especially crucial in semantic searches, where understanding the context and meaning of queries is important.
**Example Approaches**
. **Rule-based Re-ranking**
- This approach uses metadata to rank results by relevance. For instance, you might consider the recency of
documents, tags, or specific keywords in the title to determine their importance.
. **Re-ranking Algorithms**
- There are various algorithms available for re-ranking based on specific use cases. Examples include BERT-based
re-rankers, cross-encoder re-ranking, and TF-IDF algorithms. These methods apply different techniques to assess and
order the relevance of search results.
-------------------------------
**Technical Patterns: Answer Generation**
This diagram illustrates the process of generating answers using a language model (LLM). Here's a breakdown of the
components and concepts:
. **Process Flow:**
- A piece of content is retrieved and used to create a prompt.
- This prompt is fed into the LLM, which processes it to generate a final result.
- The user then sees this final result.
. **Best Practices:**
- It's important to evaluate performance after each experiment. This helps determine if exploring other methods
is beneficial.
- Implementing guardrails can be useful to ensure the model's outputs are safe and reliable.
. **Common Pitfalls:**
- Avoid jumping straight to fine-tuning the model without considering other approaches that might be more
effective or efficient.
- Pay close attention to how the model is prompted, as this can significantly impact the quality of the output.
By following these guidelines, you can optimize the use of LLMs for generating accurate and useful answers.
-------------------------------
# Technical Patterns: Answer Generation - Context Window
## How to Manage Context?
When generating answers using a context window, it's important to consider several factors based on your specific
use case. Here are key points to keep in mind:
### Things to Consider
- **Context Window Max Size:**
- The context window has a maximum size, so overloading it with too much content is not ideal.
- In conversational scenarios, the conversation itself becomes part of the context, contributing to the overall
size.
- **Cost & Latency vs. Accuracy:**
- Including more context can lead to increased latency and higher costs due to the additional input tokens
required.
- Conversely, using less context might reduce accuracy.
- **"Lost in the Middle" Problem:**
- When the context is too extensive, language models may overlook or forget information that is "in the middle"
of the content, potentially missing important details.
-------------------------------
**Technical Patterns: Answer Generation Optimisation**
**How to optimise?**
When optimising a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application, there are several methods to consider. These
methods should be tried sequentially from left to right, and multiple approaches can be iterated if necessary.
. **Prompt Engineering**
- Experiment with different prompts at each stage of the process to achieve the desired input format or generate
relevant output.
- Guide the model through multiple steps to reach the final outcome.
. **Few-shot Examples**
- If the model's behavior is not as expected, provide examples of the desired outcome.
- Include sample user inputs and the expected processing format to guide the model.
. **Fine-tuning**
- If a few examples are insufficient, consider fine-tuning the model with more examples for each process step.
- Fine-tuning can help achieve a specific input processing or output format.
-------------------------------
Technical Patterns: Answer Generation - Safety Checks
**Why include safety checks?**
Safety checks are crucial because providing a model with supposedly relevant context does not guarantee that the
generated answer will be truthful or accurate. Depending on the use case, it is important to double-check the
information to ensure reliability.
**RAGAS Score Evaluation Framework**
The RAGAS score is an evaluation framework that assesses both the generation and retrieval aspects of answer
generation:
- **Generation:**
- **Faithfulness:** This measures how factually accurate the generated answer is.
- **Answer Relevancy:** This evaluates how relevant the generated answer is to the question.
- **Retrieval:**
- **Context Precision:** This assesses the signal-to-noise ratio of the retrieved context, ensuring that the
information is precise.
- **Context Recall:** This checks if all relevant information required to answer the question is retrieved.
By using this framework, one can systematically evaluate and improve the quality of generated answers.

What are evals
Example
An evaluation contains a question and a correct answer. We call this the ground truth.
Question
What is the populationof Canada?
Thought: I don’t know. Ishould use a tool
Action: Search
Action Input: What is thepopulation of Canada?
LLM
Search
There are 39,566,248 peoplein Canada as of 2023.
The current population ofCanada is 39,566,248 as ofTuesday, May 23, 2023….
Actual result
An evaluation, or "eval," involves a question and a correct answer, known as the ground truth. In this example, the
question posed is, "What is the population of Canada?"
The process begins with a person asking this question. The language model (LLM) initially does not know the answer
and decides to use a tool to find it. The LLM takes the action of searching, with the input being the question
about Canada's population.
The search tool then provides the answer: "The current population of Canada is 39,566,248 as of Tuesday, May 23,
2023." This result matches the actual result expected, which is that there are 39,566,248 people in Canada as of
2023.
This example illustrates how evaluations are used to verify the accuracy of information provided by a language
model.
an example of an evaluation process, often referred to as "evals." The purpose of evals is to compare a predicted
answer to a known correct answer, called the "ground truth," to determine if they match.
In this example, the question posed is: "What is the population of Canada?" The ground truth states that the
population of Canada in 2023 is 39,566,248 people. The predicted answer is: "There are 39,566,248 people in Canada
as of 2023."
Since the predicted answer matches the ground truth, the evaluation is successful, as indicated by a checkmark.
This process is crucial for verifying the accuracy of predictions in various applications.

A policy of “show rather than tell” is also advised for GPT-4, so include examples of what a 1, 3 and8 out of 10
look like so the model can appreciate the spread.
Examplescorecard
You are a helpful evaluation assistant who grades how well the Assistant has answered the customer’s query.
You will assess each submission against these metrics, please think through these step by step:
-
relevance: Grade how relevant the search content is to the question from 1 to 5 // 5 being highly relevant and 1
beingnot relevant at all.
- credibility: Grade how credible the sources provided are from 1 to 5 // 5 being an established newspaper,
-
government agency or large company and 1 being unreferenced.
result: Assess whether the question is correct given only the content returned from the search and the
user’squestion // acceptable values are “correct” or “incorrect”
You will output this as a JSON document: {relevance: integer, credibility: integer, result: string}
User: What is the population of Canada?
Assistant: Canada's population was estimated at 39,858,480 on April 1, 2023 by Statistics Canada.
Evaluation: {relevance: 5, credibility: 5, result: correct}

Example framework
Your evaluations can be grouped up into test suites called runs and executed in a batch to testthe eﬀectiveness of
your system.
Each run should have its contents logged and stored at the most granular level possible(“tracing”) so you can
investigate failure reasons, make tweaks and then rerun your evals.

This diagram illustrates a framework for processing a return request using a language model (LLM) system. Here's a
breakdown of the process:
. **User Input**: The user wants to return a T-shirt purchased on Amazon on March 3rd.
. **Router**: The initial input is processed by a router LLM, which determines the nature of the request. The
expected and predicted outcomes are both "return," and the process passes this evaluation.
. **Return Assistant**: The request is then handled by a return assistant LLM. It interacts with a knowledge base
to verify the return policy.
. **Knowledge Base**: The system checks the return policy, confirming that the item is eligible for return within
14 days of purchase. The expected and predicted outcomes are "return_policy," and this step also passes.
. **Response to User**: The system responds to the user, confirming that the return can be processed because it is
within the 14-day window.
. **Evaluation**: The response is evaluated for adherence to guidelines, scoring 5 for politeness, 4 for coherence,
and 4 for relevancy, resulting in a pass.
The framework uses both component evaluations (red dashed lines) and subjective evaluations (orange dashed lines)
to ensure the process is accurate and user-friendly.

. **Evaluation**: The response is evaluated for adherence to guidelines, scoring 5 for politeness, 4 for coherence,
and 4 for relevancy, resulting in a pass.
The framework uses both component evaluations (red dashed lines) and subjective evaluations (orange dashed lines)
to ensure the process is accurate and user-friendly.

Best practices
Log everything
●
Evals need test cases - log everything as you develop so you can mine your logs for good eval cases
Create a feedback loop
●
●
Build evals into your application so you can quickly run them, iterate and rerun to see the impact
Evals also provide a useful structure for few-shot or ﬁne-tuning examples when optimizing
Employ expert labellers who know the process
● Use experts to help create your eval cases - these need to be as lifelike as possible
Evaluate early and often
●
Evals are something you should build as soon as you have your ﬁrst functioning prompt - you won’t beable to
optimize without this baseline, so build it early
● Making evals early also forces you to engage with what a good response looks like
. **Log Everything**
- It's important to log all test cases during development. This allows you to mine your logs for effective
evaluation cases.
. **Create a Feedback Loop**
- Integrate evaluations into your application to quickly run, iterate, and rerun them to observe impacts.
- Evaluations provide a useful structure for few-shot or fine-tuning examples during optimization.
. **Employ Expert Labelers Who Know the Process**
- Use experts to help create evaluation cases, ensuring they are as realistic as possible.
. **Evaluate Early and Often**
- Build evaluations as soon as you have a functioning prompt. This baseline is crucial for optimization.
- Early evaluations help you understand what a good response looks like, facilitating better engagement.

-------------------------------
## Overview
Evaluation is the process of validating and testing the outputs that your Large Language Model (LLM) applications
are producing. Strong evaluations, referred to as "evals," contribute to creating a more stable and reliable
application that can withstand changes in code and model updates.
### Example Use Cases
- **Quantify a solution’s reliability**: Measure how dependable your application is.
- **Monitor application performance in production**: Keep track of how well your application performs in real-world
scenarios.
- **Test for regressions**: Ensure that new updates do not negatively impact existing functionality.
### What We’ll Cover
- **What are evals**: Understanding the concept and importance of evaluations.
- **Technical patterns**: Exploring common methods and strategies used in evaluations.
- **Example framework**: Providing a structured approach to implementing evaluations.
- **Best practices**: Sharing tips and guidelines for effective evaluations.
- **Resources**: Offering additional materials for further learning and exploration.
-------------------------------
**Technical Patterns**
three types of evaluation methods used in technical assessments:
. **Metric-based Evaluations**:
- These evaluations use comparison metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE.
- They provide a score that helps in
filtering and ranking results, making it easier to assess the quality of outputs quantitatively.
. **Component Evaluations**:
- This method involves comparing the ground truth to predictions.
- It results in a simple Pass/Fail outcome, which is useful for determining whether specific components meet the
required standards.
. **Subjective Evaluations**:
- These evaluations rely on a scorecard to assess outputs subjectively.
- The scorecard can also include a Pass/Fail option, allowing for a more nuanced evaluation that considers
qualitative aspects.
-------------------------------
Technical Patterns: Metric-based Evaluations
ROUGE is a common metric for evaluating machine summarizations of text. It is specifically used to assess the
quality of summaries by comparing them to reference summaries.
an example of how ROUGE is applied:
- **Original Text**: This is a detailed description of OpenAI's mission, emphasizing the development of artificial
general intelligence (AGI) that benefits humanity. It highlights the importance of safety, broad distribution of
benefits, and avoiding harmful uses or power concentration.
- **Machine Summary**: This is a condensed version of the original text. It focuses on ensuring AGI is safe and
accessible, avoiding harm and power concentration, and promoting research and collaboration in AI.
- **ROUGE Score**: The score given is 0.51162, which quantifies the similarity between the machine-generated
summary and the original text. A higher score indicates a closer match to the reference summary.
Overall, ROUGE helps in evaluating how well a machine-generated summary captures the essence of the original text.
-------------------------------
# Technical Patterns: Metric-based Evaluations
the BLEU score, a standard metric used to evaluate machine translation tasks. BLEU stands for Bilingual Evaluation
Understudy and is a method for assessing the quality of text that has been machine-translated from one language to
another.
### Key Elements:
- **BLEU**: This is a metric specifically designed for evaluating translation tasks. It compares the
machine-generated translation to one or more reference translations.
- **Original Text**: The example given is in Welsh: "Y gwir oedd doedden nhw ddim yn dweud celwyddau wedi'r cwbl."
- **Reference Translation**: This is the human-generated translation used as a standard for comparison: "The truth
was they were not telling lies after all."
- **Predicted Translation**: This is the translation produced by the machine: "The truth was they weren't telling
lies after all."
- **BLEU Score**: The score for this translation is 0.39938. This score indicates how closely the machine
translation matches the reference translation, with a higher score representing a closer match.
The BLEU score is widely used in the field of natural language processing to provide a quantitative measure of
translation quality.
-------------------------------
Technical Patterns: Metric-based Evaluations
**What they’re good for:**
- **Starting Point**: They provide a good starting point for evaluating a new solution, helping to establish
initial benchmarks.
- **Automated Testing**: These evaluations serve as a useful yardstick for automated testing, particularly in
determining if a change has caused a significant performance shift.
- **Cost-Effective**: They are cheap and fast, making them accessible for quick assessments.
**What to be aware of:**
- **Context Specificity**: These evaluations are not tailored to specific contexts, which can limit their
effectiveness in certain situations.
- **Sophistication Needs**: Most customers require more sophisticated evaluations before moving to production,
indicating that metric-based evaluations might not be sufficient on their own for final decision-making.
-------------------------------
**Technical Patterns: Component Evaluations**
Component evaluations, also known as "unit tests," focus on assessing a single input/output of an application. The
goal is to verify that each component functions correctly in isolation by comparing the input to a predefined ideal
result, known as the ground truth.
**Process Overview:**
. **Input Question:**
- The process begins with a question: "What is the population of Canada?"
. **Agent's Role:**
- The agent receives the question and processes it. The agent's thought process is: "I don’t know. I should use
a tool."
- The agent decides on an action: "Search."
- The action input is the original question: "What is the population of Canada?"
. **Search Component:**
- The search component is tasked with finding the answer. It retrieves the information: "The current population
of Canada is 39,566,248 as of Tuesday, May 23, 2023…."
. **Evaluation Steps:**
- **Correct Action Check:** Is the agent's decision to search the correct action?
- **Exact Match Comparison:** Does the retrieved answer match the expected result exactly?
- **Contextual Relevance:** Does the answer use the context provided in the question?
- **Number Extraction and Comparison:** Extract numbers from both the expected and retrieved answers and compare
them for accuracy.
. **Final Output:**
- The final output is the verified answer: "There are 39,566,248 people in Canada as of 2023."
This process ensures that each component of the application is functioning correctly and producing accurate results
by systematically evaluating each step against the ground truth.
-------------------------------
**Technical Patterns: Subjective Evaluations**
Building an effective scorecard for automated testing is enhanced by incorporating detailed human reviews. This
process helps identify what is truly valuable. The approach of "show rather than tell" is recommended for GPT-4,
meaning that examples of scores like 1, 3, and 8 out of 10 should be provided to help the model understand the
range.
**Example Scorecard:**
- **Role**: You are an evaluation assistant assessing how well the Assistant has answered a customer's query.
- **Metrics for Assessment**:
- **Relevance**: Rate the relevance of the search content to the question on a scale from 1 to 5, where 5 is
highly relevant and 1 is not relevant at all.
- **Credibility**: Rate the credibility of the sources from 1 to 5, where 5 is an established newspaper,
government agency, or large company, and 1 is unreferenced.
- **Result**: Determine if the question is answered correctly based on the search content and the user's
question. Acceptable values are "correct" or "incorrect."
- **Output Format**: Provide the evaluation as a JSON document with fields for relevance, credibility, and result.
**Example Evaluation**:
- **User Query**: "What is the population of Canada?"
- **Assistant's Response**: "Canada's population was estimated at 39,858,480 on April 1, 2023, by Statistics
Canada."
- **Evaluation**: `{relevance: 5, credibility: 5, result: correct}`
This structured approach ensures clarity and consistency in evaluating the performance of automated systems.
-------------------------------
**Example Framework**
This framework outlines a method for evaluating the effectiveness of a system by grouping evaluations into test
suites called "runs." These runs are executed in batches, and each run's contents are logged and stored at a
detailed level, known as "tracing." This allows for investigation of failures, making adjustments, and rerunning
evaluations.
The table provides a summary of different runs:
- **Run ID 1**:
- Model: gpt-3.5-turbo
- Score: 28/50
- Annotation Feedback: 18 incorrect with correct search results, 4 incorrect searches
- Changes: N/A
- **Run ID 2**:
- Model: gpt-4
- Score: 36/50
- Annotation Feedback: 10 incorrect with correct search results, 4 incorrect searches
- Changes: Model updated to GPT-4
- **Run ID 3**:
- Model: gpt-3.5-turbo
- Score: 34/50
- Annotation Feedback: 12 incorrect with correct search results, 4 incorrect searches
- Changes: Added few-shot examples
- **Run ID 4**:
- Model: gpt-3.5-turbo
- Score: 42/50
- Annotation Feedback: 8 incorrect with correct search results
- Changes: Added metadata to search, Prompt engineering for Answer step
- **Run ID 5**:
- Model: gpt-3.5-turbo
- Score: 48/50
- Annotation Feedback: 2 incorrect with correct search results
- Changes: Prompt engineering to Answer step
This framework emphasizes the importance of detailed logging and iterative improvements to enhance system
performance.

We recommend using 50-100 examples
even if the minimum is 10.
Fine-tuning is a process in machine learning where a pre-existing model, known as a public model, is further
trained using specific training data. This involves adjusting the model to follow a set of given input/output
examples. The goal is to teach the model to respond in a particular way when it encounters similar inputs in the
future.
The diagram illustrates this process: starting with a public model, training data is used in a training phase to
produce a fine-tuned model. This refined model is better suited to specific tasks or datasets.
It is recommended to use 50-100 examples for effective fine-tuning, although the minimum requirement is 10
examples. This ensures the model learns adequately from the examples provided.

**Epochs**
- An epoch refers to one complete cycle through the training dataset.
- For datasets with hundreds of thousands of examples, it is recommended to use fewer epochs (one or two) to
prevent overfitting.
- Default setting is auto, with a standard of 4 epochs.
**Batch Size**
- This is the number of training examples used to train in a single forward and backward pass.
- Larger batch sizes are generally more effective for larger datasets.
- The default batch size is approximately 0.2% of the total number of training examples (N), with a maximum of 256.
**Learning Rate Multiplier**
- This is a scaling factor for the original learning rate.
- Experimentation with values between 0.02 and 0.2 is recommended.
- Larger learning rates often yield better results with larger batch sizes.
- Default values are 0.05, 0.1, or 0.2, depending on the final batch size.

**Overview**
Fine-tuning involves adjusting the parameters of pre-trained models on a specific dataset or task. This process
enhances the model's ability to generate more accurate and relevant responses for the given context by adapting it
to the nuances and specific requirements of the task at hand.
**Example Use Cases:**
- Generate output in a consistent format.
- Process input by following specific instructions.
**What We’ll Cover:**
- When to fine-tune
- Preparing the dataset
- Best practices
- Hyperparameters
- Fine-tuning advances
- Resources
-------------------------------
When to Fine-Tune
**Good for:**
- **Following a given format or tone for the output:** Fine-tuning is effective when you need the model to adhere
to a specific style or structure in its responses.
- **Processing the input following specific, complex instructions:** It helps in handling detailed and intricate
instructions accurately.
- **Improving latency:** Fine-tuning can enhance the speed of the model's responses.
- **Reducing token usage:** It can optimize the model to use fewer tokens, making it more efficient.
**Not good for:**
- **Teaching the model new knowledge:** Fine-tuning is not suitable for adding new information to the model.
Instead, use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or custom models.
- **Performing well at multiple, unrelated tasks:** For diverse tasks, it's better to use prompt engineering or
create multiple fine-tuned models.
- **Including up-to-date content in responses:** Fine-tuning is not ideal for ensuring the model has the latest
information. RAG is recommended for this purpose.
-------------------------------
**Preparing the Dataset**
guidance on preparing a dataset for training a chatbot model. It includes an example format using JSONL (JSON
Lines) to structure the data. The example shows a conversation with three roles:
. **System**: Sets the context by describing the chatbot as "Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."
. **User**: Asks a question, "What's the capital of France?"
. **Assistant**: Responds with a sarcastic answer, "Paris, as if everyone doesn't know that already."
Key recommendations for dataset preparation include:
- Use a set of instructions and prompts that have proven effective for the model before fine-tuning. These should
be included in every training example.
- If you choose to shorten instructions or prompts, be aware that more training examples may be needed to achieve
good results.
- It is recommended to use 50-100 examples, even though the minimum required is 10.
-------------------------------
**Best Practices**
. **Curate Examples Carefully**
- Building datasets can be challenging, so start small and focus on high-quality examples.
- Use "prompt baking" to generate initial examples.
- Ensure multi-turn conversations are well-represented.
- Collect examples to address issues found during evaluation.
- Balance and diversify your data.
- Ensure examples contain all necessary information for responses.
. **Iterate on Hyperparameters**
- Begin with default settings and adjust based on performance.
- Increase the learning rate multiplier if the model doesn't converge.
- Increase the number of epochs if the model doesn't follow training data closely.
- Decrease the number of epochs by 1-2 if the model becomes less diverse.
. **Establish a Baseline**
- Start with zero-shot or few-shot prompts to create a baseline before fine-tuning.
. **Automate Your Feedback Pipeline**
- Use automated evaluations to identify and clean up problem cases for training data.
- Consider using the G-Eval approach with GPT-4 for automated testing with a scorecard.
. **Optimize for Latency and Token Efficiency**
- After establishing a baseline, consider fine-tuning with GPT-3.5 for similar performance at lower cost and
latency.
- Experiment with reducing or removing system instructions in subsequent fine-tuned versions.

10 examples.

You can use the ROUGE metric to evaluate a summarization task. ROUGE assesses the quality of summaries by comparing
them to reference summaries, quantifying how well a machine-generated summary captures the essence of the original
text.

An example of an evaluation process where we look for a clear answer to compare to a ground truth is when
determining the population of a country. In this case, the question is "What is the population of Canada?" The
ground truth, or correct answer, is that the population of Canada in 2023 is 39,566,248 people. The predicted
answer, obtained through a search tool, is "There are 39,566,248 people in Canada as of 2023." Since the predicted
answer matches the ground truth, the evaluation is successful. This process is used to verify the accuracy of
information provided by a language model or other predictive tools.

Wrapping up
In this notebook, we have learned how to develop a basic RAG pipeline based on PDF documents. This includes:
How to parse pdf documents, taking slide decks and an export from an HTML page as examples, using a python library as well as GPT-4o to interpret the visuals
How to process the extracted content, clean it and chunk it into several pieces
How to embed the processed content using OpenAI embeddings
How to retrieve content that is relevant to an input query
How to use GPT-4o to generate an answer using the retrieved content as context
If you want to explore further, consider these optimisations:
Playing around with the prompts provided as examples
Chunking the content further and adding metadata as context to each chunk
Adding rule-based filtering on the retrieval results or re-ranking results to surface to most relevant content
You can apply the techniques covered in this notebook to multiple use cases, such as assistants that can access your proprietary data, customer service or FAQ bots that can read from your internal policies, or anything that requires leveraging rich documents that would be better understood as images....
