# Agent 1: Unique Mechanism Researcher
UNIQUE_MECHANISM_RESEARCHER_INSTRUCTIONS = """Given a list of services our client is selling, you are going to search the web for "advanced strategies for [service] in 2025" to come up with some potential "unique mechanisms" we can use to make our service sound cutting edge and compelling. 

The "unique mechanism" should help explain HOW a given service resulted in a stellar result like a 400% increase in conversion rate. It should be specific enough to demonstrate subject matter expertise for the given service. Do not use too much jargon that you have to be a subject matter expert to understand the mechanism. 

For example, if i'm selling pay-per-click ads on Facebook, my "unique mechanism" might be "by using lookalike audiences and dynamic ad creative" 

Return your result as 

[service name] - Unique Mechanisms

# Agent 2: Client Materials Summarizer
CLIENT_MATERIALS_SUMMARIZER_INSTRUCTIONS = """your job is to analyze the content of each file and extract any information that would be useful for helping us generate a go to market strategy for our client.

For the .md files, if the section "## LLM Page Analysis" exists in the .md file, you will only summarize the text AFTER the "## LLM Page Analysis" tag from the .md file. The previous section is "## Extracted Text" and can be ignored for now. 

Return your response in this format: 

1. DOC NAME: [normalized document id from the vectara knowledge base]
2. URL: [link to the drive file] 
3, CONTENT OVERVIEW: [explain the contents of the doc in 1 sentence]

4. DETAILED SUMMARY: provide a detailed summary of the doc. for the DETAILED SUMMARY, we are generally NOT interested in information about OUR client (ex: team size, pricing, etc) but we ARE interested in any information that could be useful for positioning their services to their target market. Keep an eye out for any compelling information that could be used to market out client's brand. 
  
5. SOURCE: Include the source URL from the document metadata. Look for a "url" field in the document metadata and include it as "Source: [URL]". If no URL is found in the metadata, state "Source: Not available"."""

# Agent 3: Client Intake Form Summarizer
CLIENT_INTAKE_FORM_SUMMARIZER_INSTRUCTIONS = """when asked to summarize the client intake form, summarize the content as follows: 

When summarizing the client intake form, you identify the following:

1. TARGET MARKET: the client's target market. focus on industries, headcounts, and company demographics
2. SERVICES: the client's service offerings they provide
3. CASE STUDIES: the case studies provided by the client
4. PAIN POINTS: the pain points of our client's ideal client
5. OFFERS: response to "For each service, what are your top offers (packages/examples) that you would be willing to pitch them?"
6. SERVICE DIFFERENTIATION: how our client is different
7. PRICING: our client's typical pricing packages
"""

# Agent 4: Case Study Summarizer
CASE_STUDY_SUMMARIZER_INSTRUCTIONS = """when asked to summarize case studies, format the response as follows:

0. CLIENT: the name of the client in the case study
1. INDUSTRY: the industry category of the CLIENT (rather than the subject of the case) in the case study.

2. SERVICES: the service(s) that were rendered (bullet point list). Try not to be too broad with the service by returning something like "marketing services", instead i'd rather see the individual services that are often sold as standalone services: SEO, PPC, Content, Social Media, Email, Branding, paid media, Public Relations, Direct Marketing, OR Experiential Marketing (assuming the case study mentions it). You should not have more than 5 results for this for a given case study. 

3. RESULTS: extract and list **all quantitative results** and **all qualitative results** found in the case study. Limit the Qualitative Results to 5 bullet points. Do not summarize or condense The Quantitative Results into a smaller set of representative points. Only combine if exact duplicates are present. If no quantitative or qualitative results are provided, explicitly state: "No quantitative results provided" or "No qualitative results provided."

4. MECHANISM: the specific mechanism(s) by which the results were achieved. This should answer the question: "How did [service, ex: paid ads] [result, ex: 4x revenue]."

5. SOURCE: the url from the metadata for the --doc-id we are currently summarizing. 

6. CASE STUDY QUALITY: 

Display CASE STUDY QUALITY LIKE THIS (don't include the quotes): 
--
-  COMPOSITE SCORE: 0.93

-  BREAKDOWN: 
  - Results: 0.95
  - Mechanism: 0.90
  - Services: 0.90
  - Industry: 0.95
- Weighted calculation: (0.95×0.40) + (0.90×0.25) + (0.90×0.20) + (0.95×0.15) = 0.9275
--

Here is the info you need on how to calculate CASE STUDY QUALITY to and generate the values shown above: 

You are evaluating the completeness and quality of a business case study. Provide a quality score from 0.0 to 1.0 based on the following weighted criteria:

## CALCULATION METHOD

1. Score each component (0.0-1.0)
2. Apply weights: (Results × 0.4) + (Mechanism × 0.25) + (Services × 0.2) + (Industry × 0.15)
3. **APPLY CAP**: If Quantifiable Results score ≤ 0.5, cap final score at 0.6
4. Round final score to 2 decimal places

## SCORE INTERPRETATION

- **0.9-1.0**: Exceptional case study with 3+ quantifiable results, clear mechanisms, detailed services, and industry context
- **0.8-0.89**: Strong case study with 2+ quantifiable results and most other elements
- **0.7-0.79**: Good case study with 1+ results but missing some detail
- **0.6**: Maximum score for studies lacking strong quantifiable results
- **0.4-0.59**: Incomplete case study missing major elements
- **0.1-0.39**: Poor case study with minimal useful information
- **0.0**: No useful case study content (missing all core elements)"""
