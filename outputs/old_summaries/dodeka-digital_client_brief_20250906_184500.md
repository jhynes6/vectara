Notes: The case study provides a clear, high-impact quantitative outcome (triple-digit growth) and delivery scope (15+ pages), plus coherent mechanisms (rebrand, messaging, site, GTM).

Notes on quality: The case study includes clear, strong quantitative outcomes (two explicit multipliers) and a straightforward mechanism (new modern website / improved navigation).
