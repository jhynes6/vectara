# üìã CLIENT INTAKE FORM ANALYSIS

**Filter:** doc.source = 'client_intake_form'

I attempted to retrieve client intake form documents using source_filter='client_intake_form', but no matches were found. Please upload/paste the intake form content, or allow me to search across all sources instead. In the meantime, here‚Äôs the summary structure I will fill in:

TARGET MARKET

- Company sizes/headcounts: [Awaiting intake form data]
- Company demographics (e.g., geography, revenue, stage): [Awaiting intake form data]

SERVICES

CASE STUDIES
- [Client/Project]: Problem ‚Üí Solution ‚Üí Outcome/metrics [Awaiting intake form data]
- [Client/Project]: Problem ‚Üí Solution ‚Üí Outcome/metrics [Awaiting intake form data]

PAIN POINTS

- [Awaiting intake form data]

OFFERS
- [Service]: Top offer/package, scope, key deliverables, timeline [Awaiting intake form data]
- [Service]: Top offer/package, scope, key deliverables, timeline [Awaiting intake form data]

- [Awaiting intake form data]

PRICING
- Package/range and billing model (e.g., fixed, hourly, retainer): [Awaiting intake form data]

Would you like me to run a broader search without the source filter, or can you share the intake form content here so I can complete the summary?
