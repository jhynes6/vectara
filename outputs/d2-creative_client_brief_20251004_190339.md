## CLIENT INTAKE FORM

1. TARGET MARKET
- Primary industries: Life sciences (medical technology/device, biotech), Technology (hardware/products), FinTech, Cybersecurity / Third-Party Risk Management.  
- Company size/demographics: Companies with 50+ employees, $50M+ revenue (or commitment to spend ~$100K/year on marketing). Funded startups that fit the above profile.  
- Geography: US-only for proof-of-concept.  
- Buyer personas: Marketing decision-makers, product/launch owners, teams responsible for new product development and expanding digital/social tactics. Works with companies both with and without internal marketing teams.  
- Exclusions/limited focus: Limited B2C work; not set up for state & local government; appears to avoid/limit sales-team (pharma) engagements.

2. SERVICES
- Strategic consulting: brand/product awareness, consideration, lead generation campaigns.  
- Brand development and messaging.  
- Product launch/relaunch and new product development support.  
- Omnichannel marketing planning (audience development, targeting, tactics, timing).  
- Tactical execution: content development (written/video/graphic), SEO/SEM, social strategy & execution, websites & apps.  
- Experiential/tradeshow services including XR/VR/AR.

3. CASE STUDIES
- Case studies and thought leadership referenced as provided separately.  
- Notable client logos called out on website (name-drops): Baxter / B. Braun (Aesculap / Hayward Baxter), CooperSurgical, Sony. (Used as credibility examples.)

4. PAIN POINTS (client’s ideal client)
- Lack of internal resources and/or experience to run comprehensive marketing campaigns.  
- Over-reliance on traditional sales channels (sales reps, tradeshows) and difficulty meeting sales goals.  
- Need to grow awareness/consideration in a highly competitive and heavily regulated environment.

5. OFFERS (top offers per service the firm would pitch)
- Brand development & messaging package (core offering for positioning/product messaging).  
- Digital Campaign Development (strategic + tactical campaign build/execution).  
- Digital Presence Audit + Strategic Recommendations (diagnostic + roadmap for digital channels).  
- Flexible entry engagements / “test drive” consulting options to prove value.

6. SERVICE DIFFERENTIATION
- Deep domain experience in life sciences (often a prerequisite to win work).  
- Strong digital expertise across strategy and execution.  
- Consistent senior-level involvement: no “B-team” — the core senior team that clients meet is retained on the project.  
- Long client relationships and low internal turnover; emphasis on senior thinking and continuity.

7. PRICING
- Consulting-only engagements can start as low as $10K (excluding designed/built deliverables like content, websites, videos, print).  
- Typical first-time engagements in the past 18 months were in the $40K–$50K range when delivering both strategic and tactical services.  
- Flexible engagement models; fixed-fee options available and retainer not always required.
