## Case Study 2: case-studies.md (Score: 0.00)

I tried to load doc_id "case-studies.md" but couldn't retrieve the document or its metadata (the query tool returned "not enough information"). I can't generate the requested formatted case-study summary without the case-study content or source URL.

You can proceed in one of these ways (fastest to slowest):

1) Paste the full case study text (or the key parts) here ‚Äî I‚Äôll produce the formatted summary exactly as you instructed.  
2) Send a public URL to the case study page ‚Äî I‚Äôll fetch and summarize it.  
3) Upload the file (if your interface supports attachments) or copy/paste the document metadata + content.

If helpful, tell me how many case studies you want summarized and whether they‚Äôre all in the same file.

If you want an immediate example of the output format, say ‚Äúshow example‚Äù and I‚Äôll generate a sample summary using a fictional case study.
