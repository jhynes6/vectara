## Case Study 2: case-studies.md (Score: 0.00)

I tried to fetch "case-studies.md" but could not retrieve the document contents or metadata. The tool returned: "I do not have enough information to answer the question accurately." That means I don't have the source text or URL needed to produce the requested case study summary in the required format.

What I need from you (choose one):
- Upload or paste the contents of case-studies.md here. Include the metadata block (especially the source URL) if present.
- Or provide the public URL to the case-studies.md file (or the specific case study URL).
- Or give a corrected doc_id if "case-studies.md" is not the right identifier.

If you'd like, I can also:
- Generate a template/example case study summary (filled with placeholder/example data) so you can see the exact format I will use.
- Retry fetching if you confirm the doc_id or give permission to try other identifiers.

Tell me which option you prefer and provide the file/URL or content, and I‚Äôll produce the summary in the exact format you requested.
