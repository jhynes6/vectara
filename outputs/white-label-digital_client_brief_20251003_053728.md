# üìä CASE STUDIES ANALYSIS

**Total Case Studies Analyzed:** 3 (sorted by composite score, descending)

## Case Study 1: case_studies_wld-case-study-education.md (Score: 0.93)

"""

Notes on scoring: the case study includes clear mechanisms and well-specified services and industry context, but it provides few meaningful quantifiable outcome metrics (most numeric values are salary/cost benchmarks rather than performance outcomes), so the Results score is low and the final composite is capped at 0.60 per the scoring rules.

# üìã CLIENT INTAKE FORM ANALYSIS

**Filter:** doc.source = 'client_intake_form'

TARGET MARKET
- Small to mid-sized ad/marketing/creative/branding agencies that lack in-house paid ad resources
- Prefer agencies serving B2C advertisers (local/regional focus)
- Ideal agency headcount: 1‚Äì15 (often 2‚Äì10 people)
- Buyer titles: owners and marketing leaders
- Preference for agencies with regional ~$30k/month advertiser budgets over national ~$200k/month brands

SERVICES
- White-label paid media management for agencies with a direct-response focus
- End-to-end digital advertising strategy and execution tailored per client
- Centralized, 24/7 reporting dashboards (includes GA4 and offline data integration)
- Holistic analytics and attribution support, even for channels not directly managed
- High-touch client service, including end-client participation and Q&A

CASE STUDIES
- Broad portfolio across diverse verticals (details vary by client)
- Notable name drop: NAPA Auto Parts
- Team experience includes managing North America‚Äôs largest online advertiser in financial services (~$100M/year spend)

PAIN POINTS
- Agencies lack deep, senior paid media expertise to activate creative/web work
- Fragmented digital efforts and reporting across vendors/channels
- Limited ability to deliver 24/7, unified reporting with GA4 and offline data
- Need a white-label partner who will engage directly with end clients and answer ad hoc questions (often beyond strict scope)

OFFERS
- Highly customized, direct-response campaign builds (no fixed packages)
- White-label engagement with centralized reporting and end-client support
- Flexible scope that can accommodate small ‚Äúflights‚Äù for certain clients and scale to larger budgets as needed
- Credibility-backed proposals referencing leadership of $100M+/year ad programs in fin-serv

SERVICE DIFFERENTIATION
- Senior-only team: no interns; everyone touching ads has 10+ years‚Äô experience
- Internal, full-time staff only (no vendors or outsourced agencies)
- Operating model and rigor informed by LendingTree experience
- Lets small/mid-sized agencies ‚Äúplug into‚Äù elite expertise they wouldn‚Äôt staff in-house

PRICING
- Campaigns can start as low as $500/month (primarily feasible at scale across many small flights)
- Generally, engagements under $5k/month are too small to be profitable
- Will support smaller flights within agency relationships to enable and retain larger opportunities (e.g., $40k+/month clients)
