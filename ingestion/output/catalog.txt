## MODERN TASTE

For dining spaces that blend elegance with everyday function, our No.01 Wood Chair brings together a vintage silhouette and modern craftsmanship. The curved backrest, gently rounded legs, and padded leather seat ensure both visual appeal and lasting comfort. Built from solid walnut and finished with a hand-rubbed oil, this chair is made to stand the test of time.

Its versatility makes it a staple for both formal and casual dining areas. Whether placed around a warm wood table or contrasted with glass and chrome, it adapts effortlessly to modern interiors. Subtle details like rounded joints and a sculpted seat edge speak to a design rooted in mid-century ideals yet perfectly suited for 2025 living.

Each piece is crafted with FSC®-certified materials and fin- ished with care by our artisans. The result is a chair that not only looks stunning but also supports a more sustainable and thoughtful way of living.
