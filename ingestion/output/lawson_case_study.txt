A LAWSON HOUSE CASE STUDY

Marketing problems designers, architects, real estate agents, and contractors experience:

## Client Work Takes Priority

Managing clients, projects, and contractors takes time and energy. This means that your own business is not a priority. You would love to create passive revenue streams, produce educational content, and elevate your client experience with automation, but who has the time?

## Standing Out in the Industry \& Articulating Value

Creating a message that connects with clients and wins new business is difficult. You need a strong message that connects your entire online presence and explains the value of working with you specifically.

## Putting the Right Team Together

As an entrepreneur, you need to find a jack of all trades to outsource your marketing to. This person needs to be an amazing website developer, copywriter, creative, strategist, project manager, and sounding board. Normally, budget allows for you to hire one marketing person who has one specialty, limiting your growth.

## This is exactly why we created our retainer.

We love working with creative professionals in the interiors and real estate space. We have provided more time, income, and peace of mind for our clients by serving them through a team model. We have assembled a team of amazing creatives, so you can invest in one integrative team instead of pulling together a band of contractors who have different systems and may not work well together. Our monthly retainers allow us to take things off your plate and streamline your processes, so you can serve your customers better, without worrying about the marketing tasks you could and should be doing.

## Let's Take a Look at Past Clients

## Where We Saved a Client Time

## Uma Stewart Lifestyle \& Interiors

Uma Stewart Lifestyle \& Interiors is a thriving interior design business in NYC. Uma prides herself on managing her clients' projects from the initial concepts to the final staging.

## T H E P R O B L E M

Uma needed a way to attract new clients with reoccurring content. She tried hiring a VA and a marketing intern and tried dispersing the work among her team. This led to disjointed efforts and jumbled messaging.

## O U R S O L U T I O N

We started by creating a comprehensive messaging guide and establishing a marketing routine. Within 60 days, we were publishing bi-weekly blogs, supporting social content, sending monthly newsletters, implementing the new website wireframe and working on the customer journey. We handle all of this within our 10-hour scope.

## T H E S U C C E S S

UMA STEWART HI, FIRST NAME / FRIEND!

## Where We Saved a Client from Hiring

## Nurture Source

Nurture Source is a medium-sized renovation firm in California. They specialize in large-scale renovation projects, working with agents and sellers to increase the value of the home before it goes to market.

## THE PROBLEM

They were staring down hiring serval marketing professionals to fulfill the tasks needed. Hiring would have put them into a season of growth, rather than continuing the momentum they already have.

## OUR SOLUTION

Instead, they were able to hire our team and save on the cost of salaries and the time spent on management while getting more done. We started with writing new messaging, developing an overall content strategy, taking over all social media accounts, and creating a 6-month marketing plan.

## THE SUCCESS

Fully onboarded in 4 days
Created a comprehensive social strategy
Implemented new website messaging to improve SEO
Brought clarity and routine to their marketing schedule

## Kate Eckstein Design

Kate's team specializes in accessible design services. She offers solutions that are affordable and more DIY friendly. While she is happy to design and install a full house, her signature services are built around shopping guides for clients.

## T H E P R O B L E M

Kate has millions of ideas and tons of potential for passive revenue. What she lacks is the time to make progress on these projects. She needed a team to learn her voice and create materials for her.

## O U R S O L U T I O N

We outlined her customer journey, identifying any opportunities for automation. We revamped all her onboarding and service materials. We wrote and designed seven PDF guides in the first 45 days. Next, we started on her guides for passive revenue and her content marketing.
