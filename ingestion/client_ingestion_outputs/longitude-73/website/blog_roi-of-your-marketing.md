# How To Improve ROI of Your Marketing Through Localization

Marketers know that once a user clicks on a digital ad, they either complete a transaction or not. Then, they’re gone.

Once a paid ad campaign stops, so do the interactions. If you want to re-engage, you’ll need to spend that first dollar twice - back at square one reaching some of the same people.

But it doesn’t need to be this way. How can you make the initial experience matter more?

Let’s use an example to showcase how. How about Dick’s Sporting Goods?

When you walk into one of their locations, you’ll often see a whiteboard showing various sporting events happening that month in town. This is being done only at the store level... It’s completely offline and is limited to only those events that the store is aware of.

This is a great effort, but how could they think bigger?

Imagine if Dick’s _really_ was the “go to” guide for all things sports in all of the areas they serve, even where they don’t have physical locations?

What if they provided a run-down (pun intended) on local youth and school sports? Or community sporting events like 5Ks, walks, and golfing events? Or information on camping, hiking, and fishing?

Imagine if they shared useful content about where to enjoy those activities locally? Then supplemented that with information on any permits needed and gear checklists.

Then, conveniently enough, the gear would be available to buy right there or for pick up at their local store.

This allows Dick's go beyond the first transaction and makes them a resource to return to again and again.

Are you now seeing how a local brand presence can pay repeated dividends on your marketing ROI?
