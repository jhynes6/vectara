# The Local Brew #47: Keeping Location-Based Marketing Cool, Not Creepy

But as the number of brands engaging in geo-fencing grows, consumers may increasingly be tired of the interruptions.

Check out the rest of our Local Brew videos on our blog to learn more about how Local Content Optimization can help brands win locally!
