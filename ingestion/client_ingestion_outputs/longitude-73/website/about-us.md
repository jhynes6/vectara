## Our Story  

**School Bond Issue Sparks An Idea To Create A Digital Town Square**  
Pleasantville, New York, in 1999. It was the defeat of a local school bond issue that sparked an idea.  
The idea of creating a central website serving as a community forum that opened the doors for a new platform—a platform for a community to have their voices heard. Our digital “town-square” was born.

**Technology Enables Scaling**  
Struck by the power of this digital “town square” platform, the team at AmericanTowns began expanding.  
By 2008 the platform had expanded to 29,000 towns across the country thanks to a test and learn approach to emerging technology.

**Answering a Market Need**  
AmericanTowns’ ability to engage with communities at scale landed us our first platform client in 2012 in the form of a national brand looking to deepen the connection to their members across the United States. Seven years later, they continue to be a great client and we've partnered with numerous other top brands, providing credible and scalable local engagements across marketing channels. As a result of this success, and increased demand, we decided to launch Longitude73 in 2019, allowing us to deliver fully dedicated resources to our B2B efforts. AmericanTowns and now Longitude73 have proven to be a trusted resource for both consumers and clients alike and as our goal of keeping communities connected coincides with the needs of our Longitude73 clients present and future.
