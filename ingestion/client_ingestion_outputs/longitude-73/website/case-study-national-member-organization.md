# National Member

## Problem

### Despite claiming over 34 million members, the brand had a need to connect more deeply with local communities across the US to maintain current and drive new membership

* They wanted to highlight programs, activities and events at a local level, however across their owned channels they were fragmented and inconsistent  
* Despite attempts at local, the brand was seen as a national distant organization in their member surveys.  
* They had no way to contextualize existing national, state and town assets to where their audience was

## Solution

### Create a local digital presence, “In Your City/Town” in all 29,000+ US towns

* Integrate and localize all brand content assets (National, State and local) across web, mobile, email and social media  
* Power the IOS in-app "things to do" and "place to go geo-location"
* Provide local impact for over 70,000 brand events each month  
* Utilizing proprietary database of content and events across all US Towns, created an enhanced user experience by adding unique content channels which where segmented and tailored to their audience  
* Over 13 national programming channels were geo-targeted and localized to provide maximum support and exposure across the local town pages

“Longitude73 did something for us that we struggled with for years. They are a hungry and innovative partner.”
