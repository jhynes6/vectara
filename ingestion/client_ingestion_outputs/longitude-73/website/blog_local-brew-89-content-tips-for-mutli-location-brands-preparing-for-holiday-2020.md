# Local Brew 89: Content Tips For Mutli-Location Brands Preparing For Holiday 2020

Today we're providing content recommendations for multi-location businesses who are already beginning to prepare for a different kind of Holiday season in 2020. We talk about the need to **_inform_**, **_reassure_**, and **_inspire_** local audiences in order to drive traffic. With Covid-19 having created so much disruption new techniques and capabilities will be necessary to communicate proactively at the store-level across websites, social media, 3rd party publishers like GMB, Facebook, and Yelp, and even branded apps.

The businesses that work hardest to deliver this type of content locally, will stand to outperform their peers and make the most of a challenging situation.

Check out the rest of our Local Brew and Daily Shot videos on our blog to learn more about how Brand Localization can help brands [win locally](https://www.longitude73.com/blog/hyperlocal-presence-for-large-brands)!
