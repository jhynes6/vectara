# 3 Reasons To Add Georelevance To Your Marketing

You know how **_you_** behave online. You ask the search engine questions and then scan the results, often starting below the ads. You then evaluate the results, clicking on those that seem most relevant, toggling between the written word, image/video and shopping depending on the nature of the question. How often is there local context in those searches? Often.

[Provide your customers with exactly what they're looking for and you'll reap the benefits!](/blog/the-local-brew-26-roi-of-content)

## Here are 3 reasons to make Local Content Optimization (LCO) part of your plan:

* **Your audience wants and expects local** - If more than [85% of brand engagement by consumers is local and if Google is really](/blog/the-local-brew-50-advice-for-brands-during-peak-near-me-search-season) focusing on the end user experience by placing themselves in their user's shoes, shouldn't you take that as a sign to follow suit?  

* **On-Target vs. targeted** - Location targeting can be a useful tool to add value to your customer's life if it's relevant. Nothing new there. But what about using where they are to inspire them with geo-relevant content like this at scale?

* **Audience centric vs. Marketer centric** - It isn't about you. It's about them and how you can help them accomplish something. So consider your various sources of traffic across search, social, email, direct or referral. [Local Content Optimization (LCO)](https://www.americantownsmedia.com/product) can help you deliver a scalable geo-relevant brand experience across your channels by blending different sources of content & data into a coherent, localized presence so that when potential customers arrive at your e-door, you're welcoming them by fulfilling their desire to [learn, go, do, or buy](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/search/#?query=micromoments&page=0,0&sort_field=date&limit=12&locale=en-us&current_source=twg_site). Whether they're looking for your business listing information, seeking customer reviews before buying or want to get inspired, educated or guided, you should be there.

### How Local Content Optimization (LCO) Works  

Think about how your customers really act online and why. A big part of what they are doing is trying to improve their life. That life is taking place in some city or town where you can _be_ and _be useful_ to them and everyone else like them across the country.
