# Outdoor Sports Trade Organization

### Problem

#### How to motivate, recruit and retain new outdoor enthusiasts?

* Traditional outdoor sports content caters to experienced participants, not beginners
* National brand messaging breaks down at the local level
* Consumers lack useful and approachable resources to discover and experience the outdoors where they live

* Integrate and localize client content assets and promotions (national, state and local) across web, mobile, email and social media
* Provide local impact for thousands of outdoor events each month
* Localize millions of outdoor places, resources and things to do
* Utilizing proprietary database of content and events across all US Towns, created an enhanced user experience by adding unique content channels tailored to beginners
* Created 8 national programming channels, all geo-targeted and localized to provide maximum support and exposure across the local town pages
