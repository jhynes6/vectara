Campaign Criteria

Targeting

Describe your top three target personas (clients): 
 Financial Services Firms, Startup Tech (Seed/Series A), VC/PE
 Small-to-medium size fintech, 
 Example- ipa.com
 2-100 employee headcount
 CMO’s, directors of marketing, COO, marketing,
 Look at older companies, 

Offerings

What services do you sell to your top 3 target personas? (ex. PPC, Social Content, Email Marketing) 
 Brand identities are our most desired service that we would like to sell-in. But we do the full 360 digital experience in-house- brand identities, websites, all marketing collateral (ads, decks, print, etc). We offer services a la carte but our biggest money makers are the businesses we plug in with on a monthly retainer business to hand all digital marketing needs across the board. We usually do these monthly retainers between $10-$20K/mo.

Case Studies and Previous Customer Successes

For each service, what are case studies or recent customer successes that you use to highlight your expertise in your field?
 Reference the capabilities deck I attached in the most recent email. But we can provide everything from dramatic transformations to a businesses digital presence by way of brand identities and websites, to rethinking the strategy and doing brand refreshes for business not looking for a massive rocking of the boat

Service Differentiation

Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? What do you do to improve their business?
 Are core market is the financial services space- where we take a modern and efficient approach with only the most top end talent to make all marketing materials and messaging dynamic and sophisticated. We are the answer to the bloated, overpriced and overstaffed legacy agency. We work quickly and effectively to solve the design and digital problems that these finance companies don’t have the bandwidth or internal resources to solve for. We can quickly fill any type of roll or creative solution that would be costly for a business to manage in-house, and we do so expertly and on time, every time. The Lodge- the creative agency you would rather work with.
 Price can be a blocker for some customers
