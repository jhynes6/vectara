**Call Structure (30 Minutes)**

**1. Warm Welcome & Setting the Tone (3 min)**

💡 **Goal:** Build rapport and set expectations for a valuable, no-pressure conversation.

🔹 **Start with a friendly, confident tone:**

*“I appreciate you taking the time today. I work with GovCon business owners who are thinking about growth—whether through acquisitions, organic strategies, or setting up for a future sale. Today is just an open conversation about your business, what’s working, what’s challenging, and whether I might be a resource for you. No commitments—just a chance to explore ideas. Sound good?”*

🔹 **Acknowledge their expertise & experience:**

*“Before we dive in, I’d love to hear your story. Every business is unique, and I find that understanding where you’ve been helps me give more relevant insights.”*

**2. The Business Owner’s Journey (7 min)**

💡 **Goal:** Uncover their background, motivations, and potential gaps in knowledge without overwhelming them.

**Ask open-ended, strategic questions:**

• **“What led you to start (or acquire) your business?”** *(Helps uncover their personal investment in the company.)*

• **“Where do you see your company today versus where you envisioned it a few years ago?”** *(Reveals growth aspirations or frustrations.)*

• **“What’s working really well in your business right now?”** *(Identifies strengths and what they value most.)*

• **“What’s been your biggest challenge in growing to this point?”** *(Helps surface pain points M&A could solve.)*

🔹 **Active listening + summarizing to create trust:**

*“So it sounds like your strengths are [X], and your biggest challenges are [Y]. I imagine that creates [Z issue]. Does that sound right?”*

**3. Expanding the Vision – Strategic Growth & Potential Blind Spots (7 min)**

💡 **Goal:** Introduce strategic growth possibilities (including M&A) in a way that aligns with their goals and removes resistance.

Now that you understand their **business context**, **introduce strategic options without pitching**.

🔹 **Ask guiding questions to expand their thinking:**

• **“Do you see your business continuing to grow in its current form, or are there strategic moves you’ve considered to scale faster?”** *(Gently introduces M&A as one option.)*

• **“What would need to happen for you to hit $X revenue goal?”** *(Highlights gaps they may not see.)*

• **“Some of the business owners I work with get to this stage and realize organic growth alone isn’t enough. Have you ever looked at acquisitions or other strategic moves?”** *(Encourages discussion without pressure.)*

🔹 **Position yourself as a guide, not a seller:**

*“Many business owners I speak with don’t know much about acquisitions—or even how to prepare for an eventual exit. That’s totally normal. My role is to help owners understand their options, navigate the process, and ensure they’re making the right moves at the right time.”*

**4. How an Advisor Like You Adds Value (7 min)**

💡 **Goal:** Clarify your role, differentiate your expertise, and show why working with you is an advantage.

🔹 **Transition naturally:**

*“There’s a lot to think about when growing a GovCon firm, and that’s where I help. My clients typically work with me in one of two ways…”*

**Option 1: Strategic Growth & Acquisitions**

*“Some are actively looking to acquire companies to scale faster—whether it’s for new contract vehicles, past performance, or expanding capabilities. I help them find the right deals, structure them smartly, and avoid costly mistakes.”*

**Option 2: Exit & Value Maximization**

*“Others aren’t looking to sell now, but they want to ensure they’re building a business that will be attractive when they do exit. I help them maximize valuation and structure the business for a smooth, high-value sale down the road.”*

🔹 **Illustrate with a mini case study:**

*“For example, one client wanted to expand into cybersecurity but wasn’t sure whether to build or buy. We found a smaller firm with the right contracts, structured a deal that minimized risk, and helped them double their contract pipeline within 12 months. That kind of strategic move can change the trajectory of a business.”*

**5. Next Steps & Call to Action (5 min)**

💡 **Goal:** Create a clear next step without pressure—moving them toward a second, deeper conversation.

🔹 **Ask about timing & openness to a deeper discussion:**

*“From what we’ve discussed, does this align with your thinking about growth? Is exploring acquisitions—or preparing for an eventual sale—something you’d want to understand better?”*

🔹 **Offer a no-pressure value-add next step:**

*“The next step I typically take with business owners in your position is a deeper strategy session where we look at specific growth or exit options based on your contracts, capabilities, and market position. If that’s something you’d find valuable, we can set that up.”*

🔹 **Let them opt-in with curiosity, not pressure:**

*“No rush—whether it’s now or in the future, I’d be happy to be a resource. What would be most helpful for you at this point?”*
