ABOUT US

At Cogent Consulting Group, we aim to empower small and
mid-market  business  owners  with  strategy  and  M&A
expertise to fuel growth and create a legacy of success.

successful  exits.  With  a  strong  foundation  in  serving  both
commercial enterprises and federal clients, we understand
the  diverse  challenges  that  businesses  face  across
industries.  Our  team  knows  what  it’s  like  to  be  in  our
clients’ shoes—we’ve navigated the complexities of growth,
transitions,  and  value  creation  firsthand.  This  insight  fuels

our  commitment  to  delivering  measurable  value  and
practical  solutions  that  align  with  each  client’s  goals.  At
Cogent,  we’re  not  just  advisors;  we’re  partners  in  your

journey to sustained success.

OUR SERVICES

Strategy typically starts
simple and quickly gets
complex. We get you to
simplicity on the far side of
complexity, bringing clarity
and focus to the decisions
that matter most.

Inorganic growth can help
you leap forward as you
progress toward your goals,
often shaving years off your
timeline by adding critical
capabilities, opening new
markets, and diversifying
service offerings to
strengthen your competitive
edge.

You’ve spent years building
your company and deserve
to reap the rewards.  Sadly,
many business owners
approach their exit without
preparation and suffer from
much lower valuations than
they expected.  We work
with you to ensure your
business is ready to sell and
you receive maximum value.

MEET OUR Leadership

Michael Nelson
Founder / CEO

In 2007, I founded Cogent Consulting Group to offer clear, sustainable, and impactful strategy
and M&A advisory services. My background, interests, and education have always centered on
strategy and building businesses, and I can dive deep into both while providing our clients with
outstanding value.

I began my career as a Marine Corps officer, focusing on strategy and aviation.  I flew KC-130s
and Gulfstreams, managed logistics as a Marine Air Group Supply and Logistics Officer, and
served on the Staff of the Commandant of the Marine Corps. During my time as a Marine, I
averaged nearly 270 days a year away from home. To be a more present father and husband, I
pivoted from aviation and pursued an MBA at Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business. It was
during my time at Duke that I founded Cogent Consulting Group.

At Cogent, I’ve helped hundreds of small business owners craft and execute strategy that orients
their resources on achieving their goals while reducing the complexity of decision-making.  I’ve
also built and exited from two companies, provided transition advisory services post-acquisition,
and added M&A advisory services to help clients accelerate their growth and prepare for their
exits.

Outside of work, I am an avid reader, photographer, traveler, hiker, woodworker, and outdoor
enthusiast. My family and I share a love for travel; I’ve been fortunate to study and live abroad,
and we’ve journeyed to over 80 countries. Now that we’re empty nesters, with our sons in the
Air Force, studying for master’s degrees in the Netherlands, and at the University of Virginia, my
wife Nicole and I happily embrace any chance to visit our sons’ new locales and continue our
travel adventures.
