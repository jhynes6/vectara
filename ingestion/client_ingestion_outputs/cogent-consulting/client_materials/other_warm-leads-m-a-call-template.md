*(Designed for Business Owners Who Have Expressed Interest in Acquiring a Company and Were Pre-Qualified by Your Marketing Team)*

**📌 Purpose of the Call:**

• **Understand their strategic goals and motivations for buying.**

• **Demonstrate your expertise and how you can help them navigate M&A successfully.**

**🔹 Recommended Call Structure (30 Minutes)**

**1. Establish Connection & Set Expectations (3 min)**

💡 **Goal:** Build immediate rapport, establish credibility, and frame the conversation to create engagement.

🔹 **Start with a confident, warm tone:**

*“I appreciate you taking the time today. My team mentioned that you’re interested in acquisitions as part of your company’s growth strategy, and I’d love to hear more about what you’re looking to accomplish. The goal of this call is to understand where you are in the process, share insights based on what’s working for other GovCon firms, and see if I might be a good fit to help you navigate acquisitions. Sound good?”*

🔹 **Acknowledge their business success & expertise:**

*“Growing through acquisition is a smart move—especially in GovCon, where contract vehicles, past performance, and cleared personnel are critical. Before we dive into specifics, I’d love to hear more about your company and what’s driving your interest in acquisitions.”*

**2. Understanding Their Business & Acquisition Goals (7 min)**

💡 **Goal:** Get clarity on their **current business, motivations for acquiring, and level of experience with M&A**.

🔹 **Key questions to ask:**

• **“Tell me a little about your company—what’s working well, and where do you see the biggest growth opportunities?”** *(Identifies strengths and their overall direction.)*

• **“What’s motivating you to look at acquisitions now?”** *(Reveals urgency and deeper goals—whether it’s contracts, capabilities, or competitive positioning.)*

• **“Have you acquired a company before, or would this be your first?”** *(Helps gauge their experience and potential concerns.)*

• **“What does an ideal acquisition look like to you?”** *(Clarifies their vision—whether they have specific contract vehicles, revenue targets, or capabilities in mind.)*

• **“What’s your biggest concern or challenge when thinking about an acquisition?”** *(Surfaces fears about risk, integration, financing, or finding the right target.)*

🔹 **Active listening + summarizing to reinforce understanding:**

*“So it sounds like your company is strong in [X], and you’re looking at acquisitions to [Y]. Your biggest concerns are [Z]. Does that sound right?”*

**3. Providing Strategic Insights & Educating Without Overwhelming (7 min)**

💡 **Goal:** Position yourself as the **expert guide** who can help them avoid common pitfalls and move forward with confidence.

🔹 **Tailor this part based on their level of experience:**

🔹 **For first-time acquirers:**

*“A lot of business owners I work with are strong operators but haven’t gone through an acquisition before. The reality is, buying a company is very different from running one, and most deals fail not because of bad targets, but because of poor execution—overpaying, integration missteps, or not structuring the deal correctly. The good news is, all of that is avoidable with the right approach.”*

🔹 **For those who’ve acquired before:**

*“Since you’ve been through this before, you already know acquisitions can be game-changers—if structured correctly. I focus on ensuring deals are set up for success, from sourcing the right targets to making sure cultural and operational integration goes smoothly.”*

🔹 **Introduce the three biggest success factors:**

*“From working with GovCon firms on acquisitions, I’ve found that the best deals happen when buyers focus on three things:”*

✅ **Sourcing the right company** (off-market deals are often the best opportunities).

✅ **Structuring the deal to protect downside risk** (earn-outs, seller financing, and performance-based payouts can de-risk the transaction).

✅ **Planning for integration before closing** (acquisitions fail when post-close execution isn’t thought through).

🚀 **Example Insight:**

*“For example, one of my clients was looking to expand into cybersecurity. Instead of overpaying for a company on the market, we sourced an off-market firm, structured a deal where the seller stayed on for 12 months, and negotiated a performance-based payout to reduce risk. That approach let my client scale* ***without taking on unnecessary risk.****”*

**4. How You Work & How You Help (7 min)**

💡 **Goal:** Clearly articulate how you guide them through the process, differentiating your expertise.

🔹 **Transition naturally:**

*“Since every business is different, I work closely with GovCon owners to create an acquisition strategy tailored to their growth goals. I typically help clients in two key ways…”*

**Option 1: M&A Strategy & Target Identification**

*“For business owners just starting the acquisition process, I help define what the right deal looks like, source high-value targets, and ensure we’re looking at businesses that truly align with their goals.”*

**Option 2: Deal Structuring & Execution**

*“For owners who already have a deal in mind—or are actively negotiating—I help structure the deal, perform due diligence, and make sure the integration is set up for success so they don’t buy a business that becomes a headache instead of an asset.”*

🔹 **Illustrate with a quick case study:**

*“One client was evaluating an IT services firm that looked like a great fit—solid contracts, strong past performance, everything checked out financially. But during our review of the CIM and management calls, we uncovered a major issue: nearly 70% of their revenue was tied to a single expiring contract, with no clear recompete pathway. The seller had projected it as secured backlog, but the recompete was moving from a small-business set-aside to full-and-open, meaning they would be challenged to win the recompete. Because we caught this early, we restructured the deal—lower upfront cash, an earn-out tied to recompete success, and seller involvement post-close to transition key agency relationships. Instead of taking on unnecessary risk, my client got a deal with built-in downside protection and a clear path to long-term value.”*

**5. Defining Next Steps & Call to Action (5 min)**

💡 **Goal:** Move the conversation toward engagement while keeping it low-pressure.

🔹 **Gauge their interest level:**

*“Based on where you are in the process, does this sound like the kind of guidance you’d find valuable?”*

🔹 **Offer a logical next step based on their situation:**

• **For those early in the process:**

*“A great next step would be a strategy session where we map out your acquisition criteria, identify key opportunities, and build a game plan. Would that be valuable for you?”*

• **For those further along:**

*“If you’re actively evaluating targets, I can help you assess deals, structure terms, and avoid common pitfalls. We can set up a more detailed call to go through your current options and refine your approach.”*

🔹 **Leave the door open for follow-up:**

*“No rush on decisions—whether it’s now or down the road, I’d love to be a resource. What would be most helpful for you at this point?”*
