Campaign Criteria

Targeting

Describe your top three target personas (clients): 
 We sell to owners of $5m - $20m (revenue) government contracting companies that desire to acquire another company.
 We sell to owners of government contractors needing strategy, growth, scaling, and exit advisory services.
 We sell to founders of companies who desire to purchase a government contracting company.
 Alessio Note: QUESTION: 1. Private Equity Firms & Investment Groups, 2. Owners of Government Contracting Firms 3. Executives & Leadership Teams of Mid-Sized Government Contractors
 HC: 20+Titles: owner/founder/CEO
 Are there industries you won’t sell to? 
 (ex. Health Care, Law Firms, Franchises)
 Companies that aren’t interested in acquiring a government contractor.  For instance, dental practices, doctor practices, legal firms, accounting firms, insurance firms, plumbers, electricians, commercial retailers (clothes stores for instance), music industry, etc.

Offerings

What services do you sell to your top 3 target personas? (ex. PPC, Social Content, Email Marketing) 
 (ex: Email marketing to small business owners in the service industry)
 (ex: TikTok UGC to Marketing Decision makers at e-commerce businesses)
 (ex: PPC to founders of technology-enabled companies) 
 Mergers and acquisitions buy-side advisory services.
 Small and mid-sized business strategy advisory services to help them grow their revenue, scale, and exit.
 Organizational design for small and mid-sized government contractors who want to scale without disruption.
 For each service, what are your top offers (packages/examples) that you would be willing to pitch them?
 (ex: Guaranteed 30% more email revenue in 90 days for SMB owners)
 (ex: First 5 UGC videos for free for DTC E-Commerce Brands)
 (ex: 30 Days Free Ad Management)
 M&A advisory services to business owners seeking to acquire government contractors.
 Strategy to grow and scale effectively, leading to a successful exit for business owners.
 Organizational Blueprint to scale businesses in line with revenue growth and avoid disruption and turnover.

Cost of Services

What is your average order value? What are your “Starting At” costs for your services?
 (ex: Email Marketing: campaign strategy, design, development, automation, personalization, and analytics. Pricing is everything from one-off projects at $10-$50k to yearly agreements up to $1MM/year)
 (ex: 1000 Tik Tok Impressions/month + Content Creation= $5000 order value)
 (ex: tier 1: $2500 CPC Budget + $500 Service Fee, tier 3: $12,500 CPC Budget + $2500 Service Fee)
 M&A advisory services:  Success fee (double Lehman with 2% floor and $150,000 minimum), commitment fee at contract signing $15,000, LOI fee due at executed LOI $15,000.  Note that the commitment fee and LOI fee are credited to the success fee.
 Strategy:  1 year retainer (after 3 months, 30 days notice to end services), $10,000 for first four months, $5,000 for remaining months.
 Organizational Design:  approx $10k / month, typically 2 months.

Service Differentiation

What makes you different from your competitors? What is your “special sauce”?
 (ex: We implement 8 proprietary flows to maximally engage customers via email. 14 touch-points across a 30 day visit to our customers site has been proven to concert the highest % of site visits to paying and repeat customers)

Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? What do you do to improve their business?
 (ex: My clothing line has stopped reaching new buyers and we want to break into a new niche. Facebook keeps getting more expensive and makes it hard to target new buyers.
 Solution: Organic UGC content is the perfect mechanism to branch out to new customers. We help you find influencers who are exactly like your target audience, work with them to create videos and then use those videos to penetrate your new niche audience.)
 My clients do not typically have any experience in mergers and acquisitions nor do they know how to vet a advisor.
 Solution:  I educate quite a bit up front to help my clients (and leads) understand if an acquisition is right for them, how the process works, and lead them through the entire process.  Because I’ve built businesses, I understand how to help my clients determine the criteria for their ideal acquisition and then source the opportunities from both on and off-market companies.
 My clients think strategy is business development.
 Solution:  I educate my clients (and leads) on strategy in a simple and clear manner which they can use far beyond our engagement.  I focus on their desired end state as a business owner (legacy, retirement needs, timelines, etc.) and help craft a strategy that fits their needs and isn’t a useless fill in the blanks template or vapid target like “sell my company for $100m in 5 years.”  My strategy efforts include their goals, an organizational blueprint (to scale), and a concept of operations (framework for execution and improvement).

Case Studies and Previous Customer Successes

For each service, what are case studies or recent customer successes that you use to highlight your expertise in your field?
 (ex: generated 50k in net new sales in 30 days for a service business with a seasonal email marketing campaign)
 (ex: generated 120k in net new revenue with a GenZ-focused organic TikTok Campaign) 
 (ex: increased CTR by 240% and sign ups by 318% with Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo Campaign)
 I have worked on 10 M&A efforts in the past two years.  I can provide case studies on four successes (some are very similar).  I can also provide case studies on M&A efforts that have fallen apart in due diligence for a variety of reasons (seller misrepresentation, buyer cold feet, failure of a contract to renew, etc.)
 I can provide a few strategy cases studies too.  One on saving a business from bankruptcy and successfully selling it within 18 months and another that drove growth and exit preparation in a company whose revenue was flat for the past decade.
