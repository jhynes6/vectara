# Cogent Consulting Group Facilitates Strategic Acquisition to Strengthen Public-Sector Digital Services

Cogent Consulting Group is pleased to announce its client’s acquisition of a respected digital services firm known for its expertise in web and mobile application development, open-source content management, and human-centered design.

This acquisition enhances the client’s ability to deliver secure, accessible, and high-performing digital services for public-sector and mission-driven organizations. The integration of complementary capabilities will accelerate modernization efforts across high-visibility programs.

_“Welcoming this team expands the scale and speed at which we can modernize critical digital services.”_

“Welcoming this team expands the scale and speed at which we can modernize critical digital services,” said the managing partner of our client. “Their track record in human-centered design and open-source engineering pairs naturally with our roadmap to deliver secure, scalable tools that improve access and trust.”

“Joining this platform gives our customers a broader range of capabilities while preserving the responsiveness they value,” said the founder of the acquired firm. “By combining our engineering and design strengths with robust data and modernization expertise, we can deliver measurable outcomes from discovery through operations.”

**Strategic Integration Overview**

- Expanded delivery scope: The combined team supports full lifecycle services from discovery and design to engineering and operations, focused on improving user experience, security, and accessibility.
- Complementary expertise: The acquired firm’s strengths in open-source CMS, custom application development, and automation align with the client’s focus on modernization and analytics.
- Unified operations: Shared quality standards and secure development practices support consistent, mission-aligned delivery.
- Leadership continuity: The acquired firm’s leadership will remain in place during integration to ensure stability for customers and employees.

With this acquisition, the platform gains deeper capabilities in open-source CMS modernization (e.g., Drupal, WordPress), human-centered design, full-stack development, and data integration. These additions will help streamline workflows, scale high-traffic platforms, and meet rigorous security and compliance standards—while maintaining the responsive service clients expect.
