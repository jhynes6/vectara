“We recently engaged Cogent Consulting Group on our first M&A acquisition and it was transformative. As we aimed to diversify and step into a new industry, Cogent was not just our advisor—they became a trusted guide, combining deep expertise with an intuitive approach. They navigated us through the complexity of due diligence and valuation with clarity and patience, empowering us to make confident decisions at every turn.

Cogent’s insights and methodical assessments gave us the confidence that our valuation was fair, defendable, and ultimately accepted by the seller. They transformed a daunting process into a journey we could embrace, and they stood beside us every step of the way. We look forward to our next opportunity to work with them and would highly recommend them to anyone pursuing an acquisition.”

“Cogent Consulting Group was instrumental in our recent acquisition of a specialized Intel agency-focused firm. We were new to M&A and seeking to expand into the federal government sector. From sourcing the right opportunity to guiding us meticulously through due diligence, Mike and his team offered invaluable expertise and an attentive, hands-on approach. They helped us secure the necessary financing with lending partners, ensuring a smooth path forward.

Cogent’s support didn’t stop at the closing. They’ve stayed engaged post-acquisition, helping us monitor progress to ensure the acquisition meets our strategic goals. Their commitment and dedication have made them more than advisors—they’re trusted partners, and we’re grateful to have had them alongside us for this transformative step. We recommend Cogent Consulting Group wholeheartedly to anyone considering their own acquisition journey.”

Sales advisor testimonial:  “Without you this deal wouldn't have happened.  Your calm demeanor and expertise got us through several roadblocks!”

“We extend our deepest thanks to Cogent Consulting Group for their exceptional support in our acquisition of a defense contracting firm. Their expertise was invaluable in identifying a seller aligned with our strategic goals and introducing us to a top-tier M&A lawyer and accounting team to manage financial and tax diligence. Each partner Cogent brought on board was highly skilled and added immense value to the process.

Cogent’s ability to secure acquisition financing on favorable terms through a trusted banking partner was another crucial element of our success. Their dedication went well beyond the initial stages, staying with us throughout the journey, even after signing the LOI, to ensure a successful close. We are genuinely appreciative of all that Cogent Consulting Group has contributed to making this acquisition possible.”

### Strategy Advisory Services 

“After over two decades of building my company, I felt we hadn’t fully tapped into our potential, and I was thinking about my eventual exit. I wanted to create a lasting legacy for my family and ensure my team was rewarded for their part in building the company. Engaging Cogent Consulting Group to help us map out a strategy for this vision was one of the best decisions I’ve made for my business.

Mike and his team brought not only their expertise but a thoughtful approach that helped us refine our goals and build a robust strategy. Their guidance has been transformative—we now have a clear plan for growth, a framework that scales with us, and optimized internal systems. In just over a year, we’ve doubled in size, and I’m able to make decisions grounded in solid data.

With Cogent’s support, I feel confident that when I’m ready to exit in a few years, the value of my business will reflect our hard work and strategic direction. I wholeheartedly recommend Cogent Consulting Group to any business owner looking to elevate their company.”

“When my business experienced a sudden 400% growth from our largest contract win ever, I was thrilled—but also overwhelmed. I found myself working around the clock, trying to manage every aspect of the business and new contract to ensure our success. I realized I couldn’t do it alone and needed more than just advice; I needed a solid strategy and hands-on support.

A recommendation from my bank’s client relationship manager led me to Mike and his team at Cogent Consulting Group. From our first meeting, I was impressed by Mike’s perceptive questions and immediate grasp of my challenges. I engaged Cogent to help clarify our strategy, organize the business to handle this growth, and develop a scalable structure for hiring more staff. 

The impact has been remarkable. I now have the bandwidth to step back and actually enjoy the growth we’re experiencing. Our operations are running smoothly, decision-making has become quicker and more effective, and the team is more engaged and motivated. We’ve shifted from a state of constant firefighting to a focused, aligned approach that has already led to additional contract wins.

Thanks to Cogent, I’m excited for our future growth and feel confident it will be stress-free. I highly recommend Mike and his team to any business owner ready to elevate their company.”

“I reached out to Cogent Consulting Group during one of the toughest times my company had faced. After more than a decade in business, we were grappling with a cash crunch following an expensive proof of concept that didn’t lead to new business. I was genuinely worried that I might have to close the doors.

In our very first week together, Mike conducted a thorough assessment and immediately noticed over $400,000 in aged receivables that were adding to our financial strain. He offered to work with our accountant, and within a few days, he identified the cause and a solution. Thanks to Cogent’s quick action, those payments were collected within a month—something we hadn’t even anticipated when we engaged them but which proved critical to our survival.

From there, Mike and his team helped us establish clear goals, including my desire to exit the business within a couple of years. They guided us through creating a strategic plan focused on growth and exit preparation to ensure the company would attract a strong valuation.

I’m thrilled to say that, after 18 months, I successfully sold the business for much more than I initially expected—right within the valuation Cogent had projected. Their impact on both my company and my personal journey was immense, and I wholeheartedly recommend Cogent Consulting Group to any business owner facing challenges or preparing for the next big step.”
