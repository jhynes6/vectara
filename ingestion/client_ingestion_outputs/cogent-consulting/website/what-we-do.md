# What We Do

**Helping Business Owners Buy, Grow, and Exit with Confidence**

At Cogent, we guide small and mid-sized business owners through **strategic acquisitions, long-term growth planning, and exit preparation.** Unlike traditional advisors, we don’t just analyze numbers—we’ve built, scaled, and exited businesses ourselves, giving us a unique ability to help you make **smarter decisions at every stage.**

Whether you’re **buying a company, scaling for growth, or preparing for a future sale**, our hands-on approach ensures you move forward with **clarity, strategy, and confidence.**

**Mergers & Acquisitions**

**Buy the Right Company, The Right Way.**

Acquiring another company is a **powerful growth strategy**, but only if the deal is structured right. We help business owners:

- **Identify and evaluate acquisition targets** (on-market & off-market)
- **Navigate negotiations, due diligence, and deal structuring**
- **Integrate acquired companies successfully for long-term value**

We ensure that your **acquisition isn’t just a transaction—but a strategic move that strengthens your business.**

**Strategy & Growth Planning**

**Scale Smarter, Strengthen Your Market Position.**

A great business doesn’t grow by chance—it grows by **design.** We work with business owners to:

- **Develop a strategic growth roadmap** tailored to your industry & goals
- **Expand market share, diversify revenue, and strengthen operations**
- **Ensure your business is acquisition-ready** (whether buying or selling)

If you’re looking to **grow strategically and increase long-term value,** we help you build a plan that works.

**Exit Strategy & Business Transitions**

**Sell on Your Terms, Maximize Your Value.**

A successful exit starts **long before you sell.** We help business owners **prepare, position, and execute** a sale that achieves their financial and legacy goals. Our approach ensures:

- **Higher business valuation** through operational & financial optimization
- **A smooth transition for employees, customers, and leadership**
- **The right deal structure** for your financial and personal objectives

**Whether you’re planning an exit in the next year or the next decade, we help you maximize your outcome.**

**Take the Next Step**

Whether you’re **buying, growing, or preparing to sell**, Cogent helps you make **smarter, more strategic moves** that fuel long-term success.

Let’s turn your vision into value.
