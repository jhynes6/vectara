# The Hidden Play: The Deal No One Saw Coming

Mar 5

Written By [Michael Nelson](/news?author=64524a42f286184fcde6afba)

“GigantoGov Systems” wanted to grow through acquisition. They had their sights set on a well-known government contractor, the kind of deal that would make headlines in their niche. The problem? The target company was well-known and attractive, and multiple bidders were driving up the price, and the deal was becoming expensive fast.

That’s when they brought me in.

They were chasing the obvious deal—the one that seemed like the logical next step for their company. But obvious deals come at a premium. I told them:

“You’re looking in the wrong place. Let me show you the better play.”

**Success in M&A starts with seeing what others overlook.**

**Shifting the Focus**

Instead of battling for a name-brand acquisition, I led “GigantoGov” to a hidden gem—"MicroSprocket Solutions”—a subcontractor with deep expertise but no prime contracting experience.

It wasn’t on the market. No advisors were pitching it. No competitors were bidding on it.

But I knew the founder. He was brilliant, but frustrated—stuck in the endless cycle of chasing subcontracting work, unable to scale. He wasn’t looking to sell—until I showed him a different path.

**Results: The Power of the Unseen Deal**

·      “GigantoGov” acquired “MicroSprocket” for a fraction of what they would’ve paid in the broker-driven bidding process.

·      New prime contracting opportunities opened up overnight.

·      MicroSprocket’s founder stayed on, bringing his expertise into “GigantoGov’s” ecosystem—creating real, long-term value.

**The best deals aren’t found—they’re designed.**
