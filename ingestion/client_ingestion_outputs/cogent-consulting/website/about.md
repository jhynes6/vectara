![Mergers and Acquisitions for GovCon companies along with strategy advisory services.](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/64524a447b17a223249e2b96/1730314930053-1D3Y202NCGEN5XCMJ1AY/unsplash-image-cW4lLTavU80.jpg)

At Cogent, we don’t just advise on strategy and acquisitions—we help business owners **think bigger, execute smarter, and unlock real value** in every deal. With nearly two decades of experience in **M&A, strategy, and business operations**, we guide small and mid-sized business owners through acquisitions with **precision, insight, and a hands-on approach that most advisors simply can’t offer.**

Unlike firms that take a purely financial or transactional view, we **go beyond the numbers** to ensure every acquisition aligns with your long-term vision. Whether you’re looking to expand, increase market share, or create a lasting legacy, we bring the perspective of both **advisors and operators**—professionals who have built, scaled, and sold businesses ourselves.

Beyond acquisitions, we help business owners **develop strategic roadmaps for growth and exit planning**, ensuring that when the time comes to sell or transition, they do so from a position of strength. Whether you’re preparing for an eventual sale, succession, or a major growth initiative, we help you **define the right strategy, enhance company value, and structure your business for long-term success.**

Our expertise spans **government contracting, federal and DoD sectors, and commercial markets**, allowing us to source the right acquisition targets—both on and off the market. From initial strategy to deal execution and post-acquisition integration, **we make sure your acquisition isn’t just a transaction, but a strategic move that fuels growth.**

Let’s turn your vision into value.

## Our Founder and CEO

### A Strategic Operator with a Global Perspective

I don’t just advise on acquisitions—I’ve lived them. With nearly two decades in M&A and strategy consulting, I help small and mid-sized business owners navigate acquisitions with confidence, ensuring that each deal aligns with their long-term vision. My experience isn’t just as an advisor; I’ve built, scaled, and exited businesses myself, giving me a deep understanding of what makes an acquisition successful.

My background includes advising agency heads, the Executive Office of the President, and Fortune 500 leaders, as well as working extensively in both federal and commercial markets. I’ve successfully completed multiple acquisitions in the last two years and have been directly credited with saving deals that might have otherwise collapsed in due diligence.

Beyond M&A, my career has been defined by leadership, precision, and a global outlook. As a former Marine pilot, I accumulated 5,000 flight hours and served as the senior check pilot for all USMC and Navy VIP flight operations while on the Staff of the Commandant of the Marine Corps. I was also the world's youngest Gulfstream 5 pilot for several years and have had the honor of flying two former U.S. presidents. My travels have taken me to over 80 countries and 49 U.S. states, and I have lived in Japan for three years. In high school, I spent a year as an exchange student in Germany, and in college, I studied in the Middle East for seven months—experiences that shaped my ability to adapt, analyze, and lead in complex situations.

Outside of work, I’m an avid reader, photographer, and woodworker. I’ve been married for 34 years and have three sons who continue to inspire me every day. These personal passions and experiences shape the way I approach M&A: with focus, creativity, and a deep respect for the business owners I serve.
