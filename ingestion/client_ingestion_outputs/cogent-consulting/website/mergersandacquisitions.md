# Mergers and Acquisitions

### More Than Advisors—Strategic Operators Who Have Been in Your Shoes

Successful acquisitions don’t just happen—they are built with strategy, precision, and the right insight. At Cogent, we guide small and mid-sized business owners through the complexities of M&A, bringing the perspective of both advisors and operators who have grown, scaled, and exited businesses firsthand.

For nearly 20 years, we have helped business owners maximize their companies’ value, navigate acquisitions, and achieve their long-term goals. Unlike many advisory firms that come strictly from finance or big consulting backgrounds, we understand the acquisition process not just from the outside looking in, but from having lived it ourselves.

#### Why Work With Us?

*   **Acquisition Insiders & Strategic Operators** – We’ve built, grown, and exited government contracting businesses, so we understand what makes an acquisition truly work for a buyer.
*   **Government & Commercial Expertise** – We have advised agency heads, the Executive Office of the President, and Fortune 500 leaders on strategy.
*   **Market Knowledge & M&A Experience** – Our team has successfully completed multiple deals in the last 24 months and helped salvage deals that would have otherwise fallen apart in due diligence.
*   **A Process Built for Business Owners** – We start by understanding your goals, your company’s future, and what an acquisition needs to do for you. Then, we find and assess the right targets, both on and off the market, to ensure the best fit.

Advisors, legal teams, and accounting firms trust our approach because we understand both M&A mechanics and the realities of running a business. Whether you’re making your first acquisition or adding to an existing portfolio, we help you move beyond uncertainty and toward a clear, confident strategy.
