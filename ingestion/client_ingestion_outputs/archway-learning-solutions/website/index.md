## Non-Profit Professional Association

The Problem:

The association had an existing 2-day workshop with dated content and formatting that was not engaging to learners. Subject matter experts with highly technical engineering and chemical knowledge were needed to come together to update and improve the workshop experience.

![On-Demand Video Onboarding and Interactive Book](https://archwaylearningsolutions.com/bc/wp-content/uploads/archway-case-studies-on-demand-video-onboarding-and-interactive-book-1-1024x253.jpg)

## Regional Senior Housing Organization

Learning Need:

The CEO and Director of HR were seeing a lack of new employees understanding the company’s vision and mission and wanted to streamline a clear and consistent method of delivering the message. They needed to tell the company’s story in a way that would welcome newly hired employees and invigorate the culture within the existing teams.

## Local In-Home Adult Care Services Agency

Learning Need:

The owners had delivered in-person orientation every week for 10 years and were burned out while also considering growing the business into new territories where it would be impossible to facilitate the in- person orientation themselves.

![Micro Learning and Gamification](https://archwaylearningsolutions.com/bc/wp-content/uploads/archway-case-studies-micro-learning-and-gamification-1-1024x253.jpg)

## Live Instructor-Led Workshop for Non-Profit Professional Association

Industry: Industrial Manufacturing / Reach: International

![Live Instructor Led Workshop](https://archwaylearningsolutions.com/bc/wp-content/uploads/archway-case-studies-live-instructor-led-workshop-modal.jpg)

**Learning Need:**

The professional association had an existing 2-day workshop where learners were not engaged, the format and content was outdated, and eleven subject matter experts with highly technical engineering and chemical knowledge were needed to come together to update and improve the workshop experience.

**Learning Solution:**

ARCHway Learning Solutions analyzed what was and was not working with the current workshop and facilitated small group development meetings with the subject matter experts to determine the needed changes to improve the product and increase attendance. ARCHway created a new custom logo, brand, and presentation template to create uniformity between presentations. ARCHway’s design focused on intriguing visuals, engaging interactions, hands-on activities and competitions, useful tool kits, and real-world application examples with a careful edit of the “need to know” and “nice to know” content for the learners.

**Learning Results:**

The association saw an increase in attendance of the workshop and the board of directors was happy with the renewed product offering. Additionally, ARCHway produced the recording of the live event to offer a virtual experience online for those who could not attend live which created a second revenue source from the product for the client.

## OnDemand Video Onboarding & Interactive Book for Regional Senior Housing Organization

Industry: Healthcare / Reach: Local to City

![On-Demand Video Onboarding and Interactive Book](https://archwaylearningsolutions.com/bc/wp-content/uploads/archway-case-studies-on-demand-video-onboarding-and-interactive-book-modal.jpg)

**Learning Need:**

The CEO and Director of HR were seeing a lack of new employees understanding the company’s vision and mission and wanted to streamline a clear and consistent method of delivering the message. They needed to tell the company’s story in a way that would welcome newly hired employees and invigorate the culture within the existing teams.

**Learning Solution:**

ARCHway Learning Solutions analyzed the company’s clear voice of their vision and assisted the company to clarify their unwritten vision, mission, values, and company standards that had not yet been formalized. ARCHway produced a series of documentary style videos where staff, volunteers, and residents shared their personal story of what it meant to be proud of their connection to the organization. Additionally, ARCHway produced micro-learning explainer videos where the CEO could share the company’s vision and several stories of the company’s culture. ARCHway designed a beautiful interactive book where the videos were housed with text about the company where the consistent brand, message, and vision could be easily shared with all employees.

**Learning Results:**

The CEO and other company stakeholders were thrilled with the end product which made it easier for the Director of HR to share a clear vision. Based on the branded themes created by ARCHway, the company launched an internal campaign aimed at culture which improved employee communication. Those who participated in the videos (staff, volunteers, and residents) hosted their own Academy Awards to unveil the final interactive culture book as a kick-off celebration. The overall impact was a simple way to communicate a consistent message of staff-centered and resident-centered culture.

## Interactive eLearning Orientation for Local In-Home Adult Care Services Agency

Industry: Healthcare / Reach: Local to County

![Interactive eLearning Orientation](https://archwaylearningsolutions.com/bc/wp-content/uploads/archway-case-studies-interactive-e-learning-orientation-modal.jpg)

**Learning Need:**

The owners had delivered in-person orientation every week for 10 years and were burned out while also considering growing the business into new territories where it would be impossible to facilitate the in-person orientation themselves.

**Learning Solution:**

ARCHway Learning Solutions analyzed the best method to transfer the in-person orientation experience into an online learning with an in-person component. ARCHway developed video scripts and produced multiple short custom videos with the owner, staff, and models. Working with the subject matter expert, ARCHway developed the eLearning audio and visual scripts and capture the voice over so each eLearning course could be heard or read by the learners. The 9 eLearning courses went through a series of edits and were piloted with a sample group before finalizing the project.

**Learning Results:**

The orientation experience was significantly streamlined where employees could complete the learning remotely on their device at home or at a computer at the agency office. This increased the speed at which newly hired employees completed orientation and could begin taking shifts. The in-person component of the orientation moved from weekly to bi-monthly freeing up time for the owners to work on other aspects of growing their business and take a much-deserved long vacation.

## Micro-Learning & Gamification for Hotel Franchise Locat

Industry: Hospitality / Reach: Local to City

![Micro Learning and Gamification](https://archwaylearningsolutions.com/bc/wp-content/uploads/archway-case-studies-micro-learning-and-gamification-modal.jpg)

**Learning Need:**

The owner recently upgraded their reservations software and found that the front desk staff was having difficulty learning the new system. The owners were concerned with any training that took too much time or that was not engaging for the front desk staff.

**Learning Solution:**

ARCHway analyzed the errors occurring with the new software and found a trend of the same three errors occurring the most often causing incorrect drop numbers at the end of each shift. With the owners and front desk manager, ARCHway developed a custom micro-learning process with videos and simulations working in a sandbox account of the software so the front desk staff could watch a short video 1–2-minute video and complete the function in an interactive simulation. As the staff member completed tasks accurately and with greater speed, they earned points which they could use to play optional games within the learning platform.

**Learning Results:**

The front desk staff completed the learning modules in rapid speed and was competitive with receiving the highest points. They were able to play their earned games during their breaks and kept a scoreboard in the breakroom. The owners saw a notable decrease in the errors.

##### Patricia and Robert Winiecki

Assisting Hands
Franchise Owners and Operators

Archway Learning Solutions is our go-to when it appears there is no way we can get a task accomplished in providing education to our industry.  When we looked at the tasks ahead of us in implementing a new online LMS learning platform for our industry, we were overwhelmed by the enormity of the process.  Thankfully, Amber with Archway Learning Solutions broke it down piece by piece and walked us through every step of the way.

Archway sourced several options that could be good for us and helped us to determine pros and cons of each company, gravitating us to a decision.  Once the supplier decision was made, they walked us through each step of the implementation process and provide much needed expertise in figuring out what was best for our industry and our association resources.  They even helped with developing the logo that we would use to brand the system in our organization and industry. Once we had the system up and running, Archway worked with us to video our conference educational sessions, develop webinars working with our speakers to provide the best event and turned them into top-notch content for our new educational platform.

For a small association with stretched resources, Archway has become a part of our team for things that we can not handle inhouse, but long to provide for our industry.  They are the best partner, they listens to our ideas and struggles, and they make a way for our small association to do BIG things!

Thank you, Amber and Archway, for being a part of our team!

##### Karen McGlothlin

The Electrocoat Association
Executive Director

I feel proud of what we have created with ARCHway Learning Solutions. The elearning courses for new hire orientation are moving us in the right direction to elevate the organization. Those employees who were interviewed and included in the customized videos felt the courses were great. It was really exciting to go through the process of developing eLearning with ARCHway and I love where we ended up.

##### Jennifer Pavlik

The Villages Health
Director of Learning and Development

I am so fortunate to have met Amber and her ARCHway team.  I had a vision a couple years ago of an employee orientation program I wanted to incorporate into our company and presented the idea to Amber. That is all it took – she took it from there and created an end result that was dynamic!

The ARCHway team, negotiated with Learning Management System providers, evaluated the company’s culture, produced videos that gave a first-hand look of employee positions, and created an amazing interactive online orientation book that left our new hires with a welcoming feeling to our organization.

With a change in my career journey, I found myself wanting something similar for my new organization and I knew exactly who to call!  Once again, Amber and her team are not swayed by the complex project I am looking for and I am so excited to be working with them again knowing the final outcome will be AWESOME.

##### Karen Ketterer

Judson Senior Living and Certus Healthcare
Corporate Director of Human Resources

Working with Archway Learning Solutions has brought a new level of training opportunity to our workforce. Archway brought additional bandwidth to our Learning & Development department and because of that, we were better able to meet our sales team’s training needs. Without Archway, we are unable to offer the practicums necessary for behavior change. Even though we had a training department, we chose to work with Archway as they brought an additional perspective to our training, and we were able to extend the depth of training we offer. Archway Learning Solutions makes it possible to offer the level of training we want to provide our employees through Archway’s expertise in learning and development.

##### Cindy Ames

Senior Lifestyle
National Director of Learning and Development

ARCHway made a big improvement to our two key industry workshops. When we approached them about this big task of updating and enhancing our workshops, they responded with professionalism and confidence to navigate the complexities of working with multiple trainers with a lot of content. ARCHway used their high-level project management processes and design expertise to make the workshops more interactive and organized. We’ve received positive surveys from participants and often sell out of our workshops.

## Frequently Asked Questions

What is the method for instructional design of ARCHway’s projects?

1.  Analysis of the need, business goals, audience, performance impact and resources to determine the best learning options.
2.  Collaboration of the subject matter experts and stakeholders to determine the “need to know” and “nice to know” content that is to be included in the course that will meet the requirements.
3.  Design with a blueprint or storyboard to work through content, brand-specific requirements, interactive experiences, and visual/auditory elements.
4.  Development begins once the client approves all aspects of design. Following the learning principle to reduce on-screen text and focus more on visuals, stories, examples, and interactions, the instructional designers follow the blueprint and develop the course content to include all necessary elements.
5.  Review and revisions are needed to fine-tune to delivery of the content to ensure technical accuracy while ensuring the content remains accessible and easily understood by the target audience. Quality assurance checks for errors in spelling, grammar, and style continuity.
6.  Test group pilot is conducted to work out any final adjustments from feedback provided by all stakeholders and the target-audience.
7.  Implementation roll out delivered to the wider target audience with quality checks conducted after the first group(s) complete the learning and provide feedback. At this time, most adjustments are minor and are quickly adjusted.
8.  Evaluation is completed to ensure that the learning program met the determined needs, business goals, audience needs, and performance impact. These evaluations can include options such as survey-based audience reactions, knowledge tests, behavior change checks, business results, and ROI.

What are the costs for instructional design of an eLearning or instructor-led course?

Complexity and customization are the biggest impacts on cost for learning development. ARCHway conducts an analysis at the beginning to ensure that any training plan will meet the desired needs and that a training intervention is necessary to make impact.

Which delivers better results – eLearning or instructor-led training?

The best answer is both. Blended learning approaches spaced over time have been proven to provide the best overall results for understanding, knowledge retention, and application. This isn’t always the case depending on the desired learning outcome, but is the general rule. If it is necessary to choose between these two options, then the answer will be based on the amount of content and how the learners will have access to the learning. Both learning methods are useful to making impact.

Can ARCHway help with improving my presentation that I plan on delivering?

Yes! ARCHway can help to improve any presentation and will follow the same instructional design process to consider the best changes to be made to take the presentation to the next level and make the instructor the star at their next presentation. ARCHway can also coach on facilitation practices to improve speaking presence and training facilitation for the presenter.

My company already has a training department, so what can ARCHway do to help?

ARCHway’s specializations can make the greatest impact where additional targeted coaching, topic-specific workshops, larger scale development, or filling a gap while hiring a new training department employee. Working WITH an existing department is an important role of any third-party group and ARCHway focuses on ensuring open communication, collaborative approach, and leaving the project with all teams on the same page to move forward. ARCHway’s coaching workshop content can be a great addition to current internal coaching programs to promote further knowledge, accountability, and employee commitment.
