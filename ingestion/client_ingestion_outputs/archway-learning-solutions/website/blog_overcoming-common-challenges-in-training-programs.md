# 5 Tips on Overcoming Common Challenges in Training Program Implementation

By Amber Carlson-Hays / March 7, 2024

Have you ever encountered the aftermath of learning programs that went off track? As HR directors and business leaders try to make effective learning programs, they often face the fallout from well-intentioned strategies that don’t go as planned. So, let’s talk about these common problems and the tips you need to turn possible setbacks into successful training projects.

As adult learning specialists, we have seen five common challenges in training program implementation that can surface: technical issues, managing difficult staff in training, undertrained leaders, diversity in learning programs, and lack of effective measurement techniques. The goal here is to give organizations and facilitators insights and methods they can use to implement learning programs that deal with problems and encourage growth.

Technical problems are common in the ever-evolving digital age, with algorithm changes, program updates, and policy shifts making it hard to offer consistently smooth training experiences. From computer problems during virtual talks to trouble connecting, the technical world needs to be carefully navigated.

However, getting past these digital problems is only one part of the puzzle. More issues are caused by staff who are challenging to train because they have different wants and preferences or lack buy-in into the need for training. To effectively engage such a diverse group, methods must be customized to fit each learner’s style, ensuring that training programs are meaningful for all.

To avoid problems when implementing training programs, we need to be proactive and use focused strategies. Organizations can make training valuable and effective by deliberately addressing the challenges shared here and putting the solutions into action for successful training implementation.

## 1. Technical Issues

Technical problems are something that you can never ignore! These issues can completely derail your best-laid plans and make it impossible to implement training. Technology is now a part of the training process more than ever in how we deliver content, connect with learners, engage participation, and schedule participation, all of which make training events somewhat unpredictable. Even if you are not a “techie,” you can prepare for technical challenges so you are ready to implement with a bang and avoid Murphy’s Law (if it can go wrong, it will go wrong).

Problems with connectivity, software, and hardware compatibility make it hard to deliver material smoothly, frustrating for both trainers and participants. The risk of technical problems is increased by the fact that many technological tools, like learning management systems (LMSs) and learning experience platforms (LXPs), can make things more complicated and require a larger lift effort to get off the ground.

Not only are these technical problems annoying, but they could also seriously mess up training programs, whether they’re held in person or online.

### Solutions for Technical Hiccups

**TIP #1: Always have a backup plan when implementing technology in your training program.** If you want to develop virtual presentation solutions, you need to take a proactive approach and be prepared. One suggestion is to always keep a backup device on standby. If your primary tech tool decides to take a coffee break, you can seamlessly switch and keep the training session rolling.

Additionally, regularly testing your software and hardware is like giving your car a checkup before a long road trip – it helps identify and fix potential problems. Make testing a standard practice, ensuring that everything from video conferencing tools to training modules runs smoothly. Also, investing in trustworthy and up-to-date equipment and software can reduce the chances of unexpected hiccups.

For learners, offer access to technical support tools, such as an IT helpdesk or an online knowledge base, and empower your staff with technical skills to troubleshoot common problems with help and guidance.

Finally, when developing robust solutions with LMS or LXP support to make learning accessible to a larger audience, it is best to partner with an expert to help you navigate the selection, design, and implementation process to avoid costly headaches and re-designs.

## 2. Leadership Support Difficulties

Does this sound familiar: Leaders who eagerly seek to take charge but end up dominating discussions? What you had scheduled for a ten-minute introduction and leadership message turns into a 45-minute company overview and storytelling. This is a tough place and needs to be handled with care to maintain the support of leadership while keeping on track with the objectives of the training program.

Leaders who actively participate in training sessions are undoubtedly well-intentioned, and their enthusiasm is a valuable asset. However, it’s important to ensure that their involvement enhances, rather than hinders, the training agenda. When implementing training, it’s best to take a proactive approach toward leader involvement.

### Strategies to Empower Leaders

**Tip #2: Prepare leaders ahead of time with a clear vision and objective of their message to participants.** By getting clear information about the training topic, the audience, and the business goal in advance, leaders can stay on track. This collaborative method not only helps leaders who can sometimes overshare, but it also makes things run more smoothly overall.

Leaders want their employees to use what they are learning, but often, the leaders themselves aren’t aware of the specifics of the training objectives or how to measure their effectiveness on the job. So, they need detailed information ahead of time that focuses on the learning goals and how they fit with business goals. It’s easier for people to use what they’ve learned and be accountable when leaders talk about how important the training is and how it will impact their and the company’s success.

Provide the leader with a “cheat sheet” that they can reference. The sheet should include the training purpose, specific learning objectives, audience, and a high-level list of key ideas for the leader to reinforce. This will set the leader and your training up for success.

If training is in response to a concern within the organization, then it is especially important to prepare the leader for the messaging that will encourage and motivate the participants to grow their knowledge and skills and to learn from previous errors.

## 3. Challenging Participants

Gaining employee buy-in is one of the most challenging aspects of implementing a new training program, especially if there is unclear leadership support.

People with a “know-it-all” attitude make it hard to facilitate learning. Often, these people are well-intentioned and think they are doing the right thing by chiming in or taking over the training.

The best solution to gaining employee buy-in is to have them involved in the development of the training from the start. By actively understanding their needs and wants ahead of time, you can craft a training program that addresses what’s most important to them while meeting the business learning objectives. However, this is not always the case, and sometimes, training programs that have already been created need to be implemented. This means we must prepare challenging participants without the benefits of early-stage buy-in.

To solve this problem, you need to motivate your employees by giving them a sense of purpose, emphasizing the benefits of learning, and making the classroom fun and involved. These methods are meant to get even the most resistant people to participate in the training program and contribute positively.

### Actions to Gain Buy-In

**Tip #3: Acknowledge the participants’ experience and knowledge to gain their buy-in and break down power-dynamic barriers between them and the facilitators.**

Managing “know-it-all” employees during new training implementations requires a balanced approach. Remember that breaking down barriers to resistance starts with creating a supportive learning setting. A more open environment is created by encouraging open conversation, fostering a culture of curiosity, and recognizing different points of view. So, first, acknowledge employees’ expertise and validate their contributions, setting the stage for a receptive atmosphere.

Next, clearly communicate the training program’s benefits, emphasizing personal and professional growth. **It’s always important to stress the training’s benefits.** Showing the real benefits of using new methods can change people’s minds if they are resistant. Real-life examples and workplace learning success stories can be very useful to show how adopting new methods can lead to professional growth and better results.

Let’s not forget to tailor the training content to meet participants’ needs. That way, you will have more relevant and engaging content. An effective way to do this in an already-created training program is to adjust the case studies, examples, and stories to match the specific learner audience for situations that appeal directly to their daily work.

Lastly, set clear expectations for active engagement, creating a supportive environment that motivates everyone to participate constructively.

## 4. Diversity Pitfalls

Even though we hear the buzzword “diversity” more often now, not all organizations really understand how important it is or how to make training more diverse and inclusive effectively. Ignoring the essence of variety is the same as ignoring the different backgrounds and needs of each person in our training programs. This isn’t just a trendy word; it’s an important factor that, if ignored, makes our learning experience less rich and successful. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) is an important practice that keeps our training programs alive by creating a space where every voice, viewpoint, and background is heard, valued, and celebrated.

Diversity encompasses many aspects, including culture, race, gender, age, and intelligence, among others. Additionally, diversity of thought is an important factor, where we intentionally seek to find differing opinions and points of view to ensure we are meeting all angles of need with organizational leadership. To implement genuinely inclusive training, it’s crucial to not only recognize but also embrace these differences.

### Plans to Foster Diversity and Inclusion

**Tip #4: To improve the delivery of the training objectives, focus first on the diversity and needs of the audience.**

The best approach to developing training is to start with a needs assessment to fully understand the organization’s diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) needs. However, this isn’t always feasible if you are implementing a ready-to-roll-out training program.

Companies can make sure that their training programs are useful for a wide range of people by taking into account and incorporating different cultural standards, learning styles, and communication preferences.

Start with training facilitators to foster inclusivity during the training, using real-world examples and case studies tailored to the diverse needs of the organization’s audience. Adapt interactive exercises to highlight the value of diverse perspectives and teamwork. Provide post-training resources for continuous learning, such as reading materials and access to employee resource groups. Finally, always include a feedback loop where learners can share their input, ideas, and suggestions to improve the training experience.

## 5. Lacking Measurable Results

Measuring the impact and effectiveness of training programs is as important as delivering them. Organizations need to know how much their efforts pay off by determining how the training programs give them a real return on investment (ROI). The measurement method is like a litmus test; it shows how much training programs actively engage participants and help the company reach its overall goals all the way to the point of impacting the bottom line. Effectively measuring the effects of training not only tells groups how well their programs are working, but it’s also a key part of getting leadership support in the future. This ongoing review makes sure that training programs stay in line with the organization’s goals, values, and mission.

### Methods for Measurement

**Tip #5: Measure before and after training implementation to compare results and make actionable changes.**

To determine the usefulness of the training programs, conduct knowledge tests before and after the training to see how much knowledge and skills have improved from the training experience. Also, be sure to determine the relevant performance metrics and collect this data before and after to see the updated impact from the initial baseline.

Measurement is not always as easy as looking at the numbers. We need to understand how the information learned at the training is being applied in daily work. By collecting input from participants and their direct supervisors, you can ascertain what is being done differently and what needs additional reinforcement.

After collecting these data points (numbers and anecdotes), be sure to compile this information into an easy-to-read summary report to share with leadership to help them see the impact, updates, and future changes being made to the training that supports the organizational goals.

These thorough steps give groups useful information about how the training worked so they can make smart, data-driven choices that help them keep getting better and make it easier to calculate their return on investment (ROI).

## Here’s the thing:

Putting training programs into place in businesses can be like managing a maze, filled with challenges and pitfalls. But make no mistake about it – with the tips and ideas that were shared, you can turn these problems into opportunities. There is one small catch, though: being proactive is very important. Take advantage of the experience you’ve gotten by dealing with common technical issues, different learner needs, and the way leaders work together. Don’t be afraid to take charge; face training challenges head-on, and watch your training initiatives evolve into transformative learning experiences. After all, the road to success is paved with proactive strategies and a willingness to adapt.
