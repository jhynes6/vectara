# AI Learning Development in Corporate Training

AI Learning Development in Corporate Training

By Amber Carlson-Hays / November 16, 2023

The pressing challenge of AI learning development in corporate training is at the forefront for organizations. As the demand for talent continues to outpace supply and industries undergo rapid transformation, addressing the skills gap has become a top priority for forward-thinking companies. According to a PwC survey, a staggering 74% of CEOs expressed concern, with 32% expressing they were “extremely concerned” about the lack of essential skills as the primary bottleneck to achieving performance improvements and sustainable growth.

Learning and development teams are on a mission to find comprehensive solutions for skill development. These solutions empower employees with the knowledge to be catalysts for innovation, productivity enhancement, and nurturing a culture rooted in continuous growth.

Amid this quest for excellence, the rise of technology has introduced several tools and methodologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered eLearning, videos, and content creation. These technologies have the potential to reshape how organizations approach learning and development.

It’s crucial to recognize that technology alone is not the remedy for skill gaps; the human side of learning development brings these tools to life and ensures their efficacy. In this article, we’ll explore the difference between merely creating AI eLearning or sending out AI-generated videos and the broader context of the human side of learning development.

##### The Allure of AI Content Development

The allure of AI content development is evident. They promise scalability, efficiency, and accessibility, making them a popular choice for organizations looking to train a large workforce quickly. AI-powered platforms can personalize learning experiences, adapt to individual learner needs, and provide real-time feedback, enhancing the learning process. AI-generated videos offer a visually engaging and easily digestible format that can be consumed on various devices, allowing learners to access content conveniently.

It’s essential to understand that AI eLearning and videos are tools, not complete solutions. They serve as vehicles for content delivery but do not guarantee effective learning outcomes on their own. This is where the human side of learning development comes into play.

##### The Human Side of Learning Development

1. **Analysis**  
Effective learning development begins with thoroughly analyzing the organization’s needs and the learners’ requirements. This analysis involves understanding the existing skill gaps, identifying learning objectives, and determining the best methods to bridge those gaps. It requires human expertise to evaluate the context and culture of the organization and align learning initiatives with broader business goals.

While AI can assist in data analysis and provide insights, human experts are needed to interpret the data, make informed decisions, and design a learning strategy that addresses specific organizational challenges.

2. **Communication**  
Communication is a cornerstone of successful learning development. It involves clear and transparent messaging to all stakeholders, including employees, managers, and executives. Effective communication ensures that everyone understands the purpose and value of the learning initiatives and their role in the process.

Human communication skills are essential in creating buy-in from employees and fostering a learning culture within the organization. It’s not enough to deliver content through AI; meaningful interactions and discussions among learners are equally vital.

3. **Change Management Practice**  
Introducing new learning initiatives often requires organizational change. Change management practice is essential to facilitate a smooth transition and ensure employees embrace the changes. Human experts in change management can guide organizations through the process, addressing resistance, managing expectations, and supporting employees as they adapt to new learning methods.

4. **DEI Sensibilities**  
It’s crucial to consider DEI sensibilities in learning development. Human experts with a deep understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion can design inclusive learning experiences that cater to the needs of a diverse workforce. They can also ensure that content and training materials are sensitive to cultural differences and promote an inclusive environment.

AI lacks the nuanced understanding and empathy required to address DEI issues effectively, making human input indispensable in this aspect of learning development.

5. **Implementation**  
Implementing learning initiatives involves more than just launching an eLearning platform or distributing videos. It requires careful planning, coordination, and support. Human experts are needed to oversee the implementation process, provide technical assistance to learners, and troubleshoot any issues. They can also monitor learners’ progress (with AI’s help) and adjust the learning strategy as needed.

6. **Evaluation**  
Evaluation is the final and crucial step in learning development. It involves assessing the effectiveness of the learning initiatives and measuring their impact on the organization’s goals. Human experts are essential in designing evaluation methods, analyzing data, and making recommendations for improvement.

While AI can automate some aspects of evaluation, human judgment is indispensable in interpreting results, understanding the context, and making strategic decisions based on the findings.

##### Why It Matters

The human side of learning development matters because it ensures that learning initiatives align with organizational goals, meet the needs of learners, and drive real change within the organization. While AI can deliver content efficiently, it lacks the depth of understanding, empathy, and strategic thinking that humans bring to the table.

Some critics may argue that AI-driven solutions can efficiently deliver content and provide personalized learning experiences. While this is true to some extent, it’s essential to understand that technology can’t replace the nuanced understanding, empathy, and strategic thinking that humans bring to the table. AI may excel at data analysis and personalized recommendations. Still, it’s human experts who interpret this data, align it with organizational goals, and design holistic learning strategies. Furthermore, human guidance and facilitation are irreplaceable when it comes to soft skills like effective communication, empathy, and diversity and inclusion. In essence, AI and technology are valuable enablers. Still, they must work with the human element for truly impactful learning outcomes.

Employees are looking for more than just information dissemination. Organizations must invest in the human side of learning development to create meaningful learning experiences. Employees want opportunities for engagement, collaboration, and discussion, all of which require human facilitation. Company executives want to know that their learning programs are customized and adaptable based on the organization’s culture, industry, and specific learning objectives.

##### Conclusion

In conclusion, the synergy between technology and human expertise is at the heart of effective learning development. While AI and technology offer powerful tools for content delivery and personalization, the human side of learning development breathes life into these tools. The ability to analyze, communicate, adapt to change, foster inclusivity, implement effectively, and evaluate progress relies on human judgment and empathy.

The path to a thriving workforce and a competitive edge lies in prioritizing the human side of learning development. Invest in people, embrace a hybrid approach, lead by example, measure impact, and foster a culture of continuous learning. By doing so, you’ll close the skills gap and drive lasting success for your organization.

##### Practical Advice:

To strike the right balance between technology and human expertise in learning development, organizations can consider the following practical steps:

1. **Needs Assessment:** Begin with thoroughly analyzing your organization’s specific learning needs, employee skill gaps, and business objectives. AI can help collect some of the data, while humans can conduct comprehensive interviews. Human experts can also interpret the data and align it with organizational goals.
2. **Customization:** Tailor your learning solutions to address your organization’s unique challenges and culture. Generic or off-the-shelf content may not effectively resonate with your workforce. AI-developed content can often have holes where a human can fill in those areas with appropriate examples aligned with specific company needs and culture.
3. **Effective Communication:** Invest in clear and transparent communication with all stakeholders. Human facilitation ensures that everyone understands the value of learning initiatives. When everyone is on the same page, the learning environment will be positive, and employees will understand what they are learning and why it matters.
4. **Change Management:** When introducing new learning initiatives, apply change management practices to ease transitions and gain employee buy-in. This starts with aligning the people involved in identifying the need for change and the direction of the change. At its core, change management is about effective communication and clear processes. Using a hybrid approach between AI-generated processes and human expert delivery will help your change management efforts streamline more quickly.
5. **Inclusive Learning:** Prioritize diversity, equity, and inclusion sensibilities in learning development to create a welcoming and supportive environment. AI algorithms can scan for inequities, but humans interpret and appropriately correct misalignments or misrepresentations.
6. **Continuous Evaluation:** Continuously evaluate the impact of your learning initiatives. AI can assist with data analysis, but human judgment is essential for interpreting results and making strategic adjustments.
