# Team

## Jon Dindas - Founder & CEO
In his twenty years of event industry experience, Jon Dindas has held almost every title in the business – from production manager and producer, to venue designer and festival director. Dindas has done it all. He has worked with some of the biggest names in the world of music and entertainment. Prior to founding G4D Productions in 2015, Dindas was the Director of Production at Dayglo Ventures where he oversaw production design, installation, and daily implementation at the Capitol Theatre, Lockn’ Festival, and the Brooklyn Bowls in Las Vegas and London. For the past several years, Dindas has been the Production Manager of Lockn’ Festival and Wilco’s Solid Sound Festival. He has also been the producer of Warren Haynes’ Christmas Jam since 2008, and the Main Stage manager at both Governor’s Ball and The Meadows. Dindas lives in New York City and has a college-aged daughter, Josie who is way cooler than any rock star he knows. He spends his days daydreaming about Boygenius and rooting for Everton and other shitty sports teams.

She thrives amidst organized chaos, orchestrating collaboration across various departments. Hallee is always eager to meet new people across the country, problem-solve to keep a project rolling, and watch hard work ultimately come together.
