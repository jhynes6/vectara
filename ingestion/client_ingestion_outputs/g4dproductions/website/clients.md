## President - Brett Kopelan - Debra of America Benefit Concert at The Capitol Theatre - Port Chester, NY

“G4D Productions is the best company that we have worked with at helping us use music to further our cause. There is a special balance when using music to raise money and awareness for a charity and G4D lives in that space. Whether buying talent or producing the events, from theaters to ballparks, G4D has been a successful and valued partner.”

## President - Kathleen Rogers - EDN & March for Science - The Capitol - Washington, DC

“Jon and G4D Productions are consummate professionals. Working with a non-profit the size of Earth Day Network, on the National Wall in Washington DC and on events as intricate as ours is not easy and G4D always makes it all happen. You can also feel the personal attachment that Jon brings to the causes he supports and sometimes that makes all the difference. If you are a non-profit, large or small, that is looking to do an event, G4D Productions should be your first call.”

## Private Client

“Jon makes dreams a reality by making the unlikely possible. He’s always got an idea, an inspiration and a solution. We are forever grateful for his contributions to memories we will cherish always.”

## Tour Manager - Eric Frankhouser - Wilco’s Music and Arts Festival - North Adams, MA

“For the better part of a decade, Jon Dindas and G4D have been my first call for festival Production Management and infrastructure. It is a trusted relationship I count on when the stakes are highest.”

## Owner and Founder - Peter Shapiro - LOCKN' Music Festival - Arrington, VA

“Jon Dindas is the first and only person I turn to when an event is big and important, and usually complicated too. We have worked together for 25 years and he has the best instincts in the business to do whatever it takes to make a concert or a private event or party something that the guests and the acts will remember forever. G4D has expanded Jon's ability to execute events across the country while maintaining their level of excellence, across all levels and sizes of productions. I think I may call Jon now, actually…”
