### Jill Tuck

Coming from the AEG production team at PlayStation Theater, as well as various other special events and festivals, Jill is the General Manager of G4D Productions. She aims to be the glue that bonds all the fundamental parts of the company that will generate the one of a kind experiences that G4D provides. She thinks people should never leave their home without their phone, wallet, keys and sense of humor.

Since arriving at G4D in 2019, she has focused her efforts on Talent and Production Coordination and Project Management. She brings a quick wit, amazing work ethic and a smile to every job she undertakes. When not focusing on being the best event manager she can be Grace spends her time plotting her hostile takeover of Converse, singing in her car and doting on the most important little man in the world…her new nephew Grant.

### Adrianne Salmon

Adrianne, more commonly known as "Age," came to G4D after nearly ten years of honing her social media management skills. From restaurants to venues to vacuum cleaner part suppliers (seriously), Age has worked for a wide range of companies and clients, but has found that her passion lies in hospitality and entertainment. She lives in Buffalo and currently serves as the marketing director for Buffalo Iron Works and the Cobblestone Live Music & Arts Festival.

### Jen Caruso

Jen Caruso is a live event enthusiast. Dubbed the Director of Fun by many, she has been in the event scene for more than 10 years, helping pull off some of the largest and most legendary festivals and events in the country. When she is not working events she is traveling the country in her RV, singing karaoke in her mic to no one and fist pumping to Phish. She currently resides in San Diego with her dirt bike, surfboard, RV and various other outdoor toys for a much welcomed change of scenery. Since joining G4D again in 2021 Caruso looks to build on the strong foundation and partnerships forged and bring a little more light to the world at large through her part in these events. Caruso’s real forte is a creative melding of productions, operations, and activations. This self-proclaimed happen-maker lives by her conviction that we are all lost without being a part of something greater than ourselves.

### Katie Budge

Katie Budge is a live events contractor who has been working in music festivals and corporate events for over 8 years across the country. She specializes in event management, production, logistics and coordination, and artist relations, but thrives in any environment where she can organize chaos. While she loves a good challenge, Katie’s favorite part about the music industry (outside of the music itself) is the sense of family that’s fostered when you find an excellent work environment and associates. She’s extremely happy to report that is what G4D has brought back into her life, when she joined the team in March of 2021 as a Production and Events Coordinator. As one of the newest members of the G4D team, Katie is extremely excited to continue to learn from her colleagues at G4D, facilitate extremely positive working environments and experiences for our team + all contractors we hire, and curate events that rise to a standard of excellence that is tangible to the not only the patrons, but the client, talent, and crew alike.
