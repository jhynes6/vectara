 (ex: We sell to small business owners in the services industry with more than 10 employees) 
 (ex: We sell to marketing decision makers at ecommerce businesses with more than 5 employees) 
 Are there industries you won’t sell to? 
 (ex. Health Care, Law Firms, Franchises)

Offerings

What services do you sell to your top 3 target personas? (ex. PPC, Social Content, Email Marketing) 
 (ex: Email marketing to small business owners in the service industry)
 (ex: TikTok UGC to Marketing Decision makers at e-commerce businesses)
 (ex: PPC to founders of technology-enabled companies) 
 For each service, what are your top offers (packages/examples) that you would be willing to pitch them?
 (ex: Guaranteed 30% more email revenue in 90 days for SMB owners)
 (ex: First 5 UGC videos for free for DTC E-Commerce Brands)
 (ex: 30 Days Free Ad Management)

Cost of Services

What is your average order value? What are your “Starting At” costs for your services?
 (ex: Email Marketing: campaign strategy, design, development, automation, personalization, and analytics. Pricing is everything from one-off projects at $10-$50k to yearly agreements up to $1MM/year)
 (ex: 1000 Tik Tok Impressions/month + Content Creation= $5000 order value)
 (ex: tier 1: $2500 CPC Budget + $500 Service Fee, tier 3: $12,500 CPC Budget + $2500 Service Fee)

Service Differentiation

What makes you different from your competitors? What is your “special sauce”?
 (ex: We implement 8 proprietary flows to maximally engage customers via email. 14 touch-points across a 30 day visit to our customers site has been proven to concert the highest % of site visits to paying and repeat customers)

Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? What do you do to improve their business?
 (ex: My clothing line has stopped reaching new buyers and we want to break into a new niche. Facebook keeps getting more expensive and makes it hard to target new buyers.
 Solution: Organic UGC content is the perfect mechanism to branch out to new customers. We help you find influencers who are exactly like your target audience, work with them to create videos and then use those videos to penetrate your new niche audience.)
