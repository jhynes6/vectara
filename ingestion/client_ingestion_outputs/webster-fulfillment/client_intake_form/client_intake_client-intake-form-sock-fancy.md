Service Differentiation

What makes you different from your competitors? What is your “special sauce”?
 (ex: We implement 8 proprietary flows to maximally engage customers via email. 14 touch-points across a 30 day visit to our customers site has been proven to concert the highest % of site visits to paying and repeat customers)
 We offer competitive, low minimums starting at 25-50 pcs depending on the product.
 We have an in-house creative team at your service, for FREE. All we need is your logo and/or brand guidelines and we'll handle the rest. 
 We can customize everything from the product design, tags, and packaging. 
 We have fast turnarounds! Orders ship within 2-3 weeks of artwork approval for overseas production and as soon as 3-5 business days for domestic production.

Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? What do you do to improve their business?
 (ex: My clothing line has stopped reaching new buyers and we want to break into a new niche. Facebook keeps getting more expensive and makes it hard to target new buyers.
 Solution: Organic UGC content is the perfect mechanism to branch out to new customers. We help you find influencers who are exactly like your target audience, work with them to create videos and then use those videos to penetrate your new niche audience.)
 For promotional products, companies typically purchase items that people throw away. They aren’t memorable. We can help elevate their brand with new, custom branding on our premium & unique product offerings. We make products that their customers and clients will want to keep.
