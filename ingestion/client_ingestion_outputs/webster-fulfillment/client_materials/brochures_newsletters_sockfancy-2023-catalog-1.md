LET'S ELEVATE
YOUR BRAND.

P A G E   4

TRADE SHOWS + CONFERENCES

Level up at your next event with branded swag that
gives your company a unique edge amongst
competitors. Our team is ready to help brainstorm
fun and creative ways to help you stand out. Deliver
a branded, memorable experience that drives buzz
for attendees and potential prospects.

CHARITY EVENTS + FUNDRAISERS

Whether in-person or virtual, these events are about
building and strengthening connections. One of the
best ways to engage attendees is with attention-
grabbing, branded merchandise that's not only
curated to the event but also stands out from the
"typical swag" that ends up forgotten or discarded.

CORPORATE GIFTING

From clients to customers, nothing shows how
much you appreciate someone like a personalized
gift. We're working with Fortune 500 companies to
create an experience that not only helps strengthen
their existing relationships. Oh, and did we mention
our drop shipping capabilities?

EMPLOYEE APPRECIATION

Your team is one-of-a-kind. Why give them dime-a-
dozen swag? We've got you covered from employee
recognition programs and onboarding kits to
holiday gifts for your team. Welcome new hires with
personalized swag made especially for them. With
just their name and address, we can handle the rest
with our custom personalization!
