"F1 Cloud Solutions provided a complete service.  From seamless onboarding to deep technical expertise, there was no question or project they could not handle.  F1 Cloud Solutions helped us build a robust IT solution that felt like a part of my organization rather than outsourced.  I could count on the team to keep me aware of cyber threats and changing technology.  I could also count on them to help me with the more mundane tasks like keeping track of licenses and ensuring we offboard accounts properly to keep company data secure and support ongoing compliance requirements." – **Owner, Government Contracting Consultant**

"F1 earned our confidence through their responsiveness. They gained our loyalty when they completed our digital transformation journey to be a fully cloud managed practice. F1 introduced change in phases that minimized day to day interruptions and the end result was a seamless migration that allowed us to be rid of our on premise systems. We were then able to open a new practice with less resources as there was no major infrastructure needed. This has positioned us to grow in a way we wouldn't have been able to before, all while increasing our efficiency and maintaining necessary HIPAA compliance." – **Practice Administrator, Medical Office**

"Regarding our relationship with F1, I have 3 key things to share:

​

* Most important, F1 configured our environment in a leading practices manner with sustainability and scale at the forefront of design. Our environment is evaluated by client IT security teams when we are onboarded as a new vendor.  Our risk profile is consistently evaluated to be low based on our leading practice setup
* F1 provides reliable and dependable responses for security assessments.
* The speed and agility in response times is outstanding." – **Partner, Consulting Firm**

"Our experience with F1 has been wonderful and top-notch.  Their staff has been very responsive to all of our needs.  They have worked diligently to move us to the cloud and have guided us to get the best usage of Microsoft Office 365.  They provided technology solutions to enable our staff to be able to work from home during the current crisis.   They want the best solutions that make sense economically not only now, but years down the road. F1 analyzes our business processes and workflows to offer advice on how we can be more efficient and secure with the tools at our disposal." – **Partner, Accounting Firm**

"Before our company selected a new IT partner, we interviewed other companies but were most impressed by F1 b/c they were professional, knowledgeable, respectful (since we are a small business), and responsive.  In one of the interviews, they mentioned that if there was a product or service that they believed was important, they would “gently” hound us until we made the decision to move forward.  Having to work from home is one of those examples and we are extremely grateful for their perseverance." – **President, Real Estate Portfolio Firm**
