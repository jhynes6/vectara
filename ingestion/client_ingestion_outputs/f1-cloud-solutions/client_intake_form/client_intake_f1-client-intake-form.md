 Compliance projects for initial compliance $8,000-$25,000 depending upon if client is a partner of F1 (less time by far), size of organization and complexity of network
 Migration projects range from $10,000-$35,000, again, depending upon similar parameters as other project work

Service Differentiation

What makes you different from your competitors? What is your “special sauce”?
 F1 has focused on hiring exceptionally smart IT talent driven by curiosity to solve problems with scalability at the forefront of the solutions put in place allowing our clients to remain focused on what helps their business to grow.  We provide exceptional help desk support with initial response within 8-12 minutes.  We have live people answering our phones - no automated answering other than voicemail if we are unable to answer (rare event - perhaps once/month).We emphasize the “journey” with our clients not allowing them to dictate IT direction if it will leave them behind.  We have configured our clients in a more advanced way than the vast majority of our competitors which allows for richer integrations amongst their platforms and a more fluid, efficient and secure experience.

Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? What do you do to improve their business?
 I don’t understand IT, and might even say I hate IT because it makes life so difficult, so I need to have complete confidence that an IT partner will have my best interests at heart - functionality, leading edge solutions that we understand and can handle and consideration for the  economics of the solutions that are provided.
 Solution: F1’s core values are Collaboration, Stewardship and Transformation.  We take our partnerships extremely seriously, which is why so many of our clients have been with us for over a dozen years.  We are communicative (even fun!).  We yearn for our clients’ success because we know that their success will lead to our own, which means we have to always be considering new, more advanced and economical solutions as long as they are secure and further optimize the client experience.
