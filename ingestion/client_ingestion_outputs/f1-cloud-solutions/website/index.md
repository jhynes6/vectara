## From Our Leadership

F1 begins with faith in people.  The pace of technological change has continuously called into question the relevance of humanity. We begin with the recognition that technology is a tool created by people for people. By understanding IT systems at their core and  embracing technology as an extension of the value of a business’ team members, we keep the emphasis on the “why” before we design the “how.” We embrace our role as your internal IT department recognizing your success as tied in with ours. F1 enters conversations about what is happening as well as what is possible across the IT landscape articulating it in “non-IT speak” to make the topic approachable.

Technology strategy is an increasingly important part of a company’s plans for the future. The ability to forecast needs and configure systems for scalability can be a key differentiator. F1 works with our clients to understand the needs of their business within their industry to ensure that technology is being used to enhance capabilities, making teams more efficient as growth and changes occur.

Our focus on the relationship between technology and people steers us towards how technology can catalyze optimum workforce performance. In today’s world, that is more critical than ever given the frequency with which teams and their clients are often working on solutions from different geographic locations. Through focus on identity management, F1 provides Endpoint Management, Security, and Compliance in a holistic platform which enables your team to function more seamlessly and securely.

Contact F1 today if you are seeking a company that can not only provide excellent support for your IT footprint but can work with you throughout the partnership to fully leverage and integrate your IT platforms to enhance your competitive posture and further you to your goals.
