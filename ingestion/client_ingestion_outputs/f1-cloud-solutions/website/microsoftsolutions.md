# Microsoft Solutions Partner

Microsoft has created the platforms that power the world and are familiar to us all, from Windows to Office, and helped pioneer what you know as the ‘cloud’ with advancements that allow us more freedom to be creative. F1 is certified across the broadening landscape and has processes in place to ensure you are getting the most effective and economically efficient Microsoft licensing and cloud solutions.

###### Microsoft’s expanding ecosystem is powering the world.

F1 will advise and navigate you through. We choose and fully manage your licensing options to best align with your business needs and compliance requirements; optimizing Office applications beyond the familiar Word and Excel; and best practice usage of SharePoint/OneDrive. We speak Azure, Power BI, and Power Automate, fully understanding how to connect these tools within your environment.

Microsoft Teams is the hub for collaborative teamwork. Teams enables instant messaging, audio and video calling, rich online meetings, mobile experiences, and extensive web conferencing capabilities. Teams provides file and data collaboration and extensibility features, and integrates with the Microsoft 365 ecosystem and other Microsoft partner apps. Teams is quickly becoming the central place in which companies work together to optimize their solution delivery.

Security should be the core of all information technology. Within Microsoft, user identity is the central focus. Management of that identity is therefore at F1’s core. Our focus is securing access based on the identity of the user so that it doesn’t matter whether it’s on a Laptop, Tablet or Mobile Device, corporate owned data and applications stay secure.
