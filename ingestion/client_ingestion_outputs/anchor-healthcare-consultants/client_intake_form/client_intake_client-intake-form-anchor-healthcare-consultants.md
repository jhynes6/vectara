Campaign Criteria

Targeting

Describe your top three target personas (clients): 
 We sell to VPs of Revenue Cycle and CFOs of hospital or provider groups who are on Epic (EHR technology) or are in the process of buying/installing Epic.
 We sell to CIOs and Epic team leaders (directors or VPs) who are on Epic (EHR technology) or are in the process of buying/installing Epic and need to additional staff. 
 Are there industries you won’t sell to? 
 If they use another EHR, they are not a strong target.
 If they are in healthcare, but not on the provider or hospital side, we will not sell to them. 

Offerings

What services do you sell to your top 3 target personas? (ex. PPC, Social Content, Email Marketing) 
 We sell our expert Epic-focused staffing and managed services to Epic teams (IT) that require additional application bandwidth or expertise. 
 We sell revenue cycle optimization and strategic consulting services to drive targeted performance improvement in the revenue cycle (Operations) 
 We offer revenue cycle operations and revenue cycle application assessments at a fixed fee (Operations)
 For each service, what are your top offers (packages/examples) that you would be willing to pitch them?
 For staffing, we would offer our first contract/placement at cost to establish the relationship. 
 For consulting, we would offer a 20% discount on our revenue cycle assessment that highlights key opportunity areas. 

Cost of Services

What is your average order value? What are your “Starting At” costs for your services?
 Initial engagements can vary widely depending on scope and structure of the client deliverable.   At the low-end, we would look for about $40,000-60,000. 

Service Differentiation

What makes you different from your competitors? What is your “special sauce”?
 As a smaller firm, we are able to offer extremely competitive pricing while maintaining a high standard of excellence on all projects.   Our consulting team has deep Epic application expertise and has built a reputation for high-impact, high-ROI projects that aim to drive more value from your existing technology investments in Epic and more broadly.   We have developed an in-house analytics tool that supports our services and is able to accelerate our time to implement meaningful workflow enhancements.  

Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? What do you do to improve their business?
 IT Clients
 We do not have enough resources to ____________. 
 Execute a new Epic project or build out a key piece of functionality within our live Epic instance
 Backfill a recent vacancy 
 Keep up with support tickets in our ticketing system
 Work on a challenging or complex project (i.e. insufficient knowledge)
 As primarily former Epic employees, our highly experienced revenue cycle consultant teams can provide support to IT/Epic teams to bridge staffing gaps or supplement team expertise.   We have a managed services offering and can also build teams from leadership to analyst level by providing resources.
 RC Clients
 “We are not getting what we need from IT or we do not have Epic expertise and do not know what our options are.  We feel like Epic can be doing more for us, but do not know where to start”
 Our solutions are all about adaptability and being able to meet the customer “where they are”.  Every organization has different strengths and is in a different place on the Epic adoption curve so our approach is to partner with them to really understand how we can help them improve top and bottom-line revenue.   For clients installing Epic, we support operations through key decisions and planning tied to the Epic implementation.  For live Epic clients, we have a revenue cycle transformation service line and an analytics offering that is used a diagnostic to understand key opportunity areas that allow us to design a project plan. 

Case Studies and Previous Customer Successes

For each service, what are case studies or recent customer successes that you use to highlight your expertise in your field?
 (ex: generated 50k in net new sales in 30 days for a service business with a seasonal email marketing campaign)
 (ex: generated 120k in net new revenue with a GenZ-focused organic TikTok Campaign) 
 (ex: increased CTR by 240% and sign ups by 318% with Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo Campaign)
