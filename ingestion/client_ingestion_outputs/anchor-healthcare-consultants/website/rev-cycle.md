The revenue cycle is the backbone of your healthcare institution. At Anchor we are experts at navigating the shifting landscape of payor, provider and patient needs.

Optimizing the revenue cycle requires looking beyond billing. Financial performance is not strictly a financial issue- rather it is a strategic, operational and technological issue. Anchorâ€™s team of experts takes a comprehensive approach to the revenue cycle. We design and implement custom plans to optimize your financial performance. We start by defining key focus areas to understand the core areas for improvement within the billing cycle. Next in-depth strategy sessions are held with your IT and operational teams to target these areas. After completing a detailed analysis of your focus areas, we devise an in-depth project proposal providing configuration recommendations centered on key deliverables. During project execution phase, our experienced consultants work closely with you to ensure all goals are met. The project culminates in a final delivery presentation where maintenance documents are provided to your IT team for long-term support of the deliverables.

With Anchor, get these results:

*   Decrease AR Days & Accelerate Cash Collection
*   Increase First Pass Payment Rate
*   Improve Denial Management
*   Faster Claims Processing

###### CASH ACCELERATION

Before rolling out a new build, testing is critical. New workflow processes, user interfaces, and third-party interfaces require careful calibration and synchronization. Well-executed and comprehensive testing ensures the software will work optimally for both patients and care-givers throughout your organization. Anchor will check, double-check, and triple-check the project build so that your planning and hard work pays off.
