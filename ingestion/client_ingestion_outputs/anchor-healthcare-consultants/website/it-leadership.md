#### IT Leadership creates the framework for Epic Implementation success.

## Application Leaders

Sometimes the missing link in your team is leadership for inexperienced FTEs. Our experienced team of Epic experts can provide application or team-level support for your organization’s existing IT infrastructure. With our support, your FTEs will learn the keys to successful execution within their workflows to handle all of the challenges that come up throughout the Epic product life cycle.

## Project Leaders

A team without experienced, knowledgeable leaders can fall short of the high demands of an Epic implementation, upgrade, or optimization project. Anchor’s skilled leaders can provide the necessary guiding hand for your project to ensure success that is on schedule, on budget, and to the highest degree of execution.

## Application Experts

Application leaders leverage both technical and operational expertise to lead detailed discovery so that they can design for your organization’s unique needs while also ensuring best practice workflow adoption.

Our team of experienced and Epic-certified consultants guides you through EHR implementation and optimization, tailoring technology to your needs. With expertise across all applications and roles, we bring best practices and lessons learned from complex implementations to empower your team. By working alongside our mentors, your staff gains hands-on application skills throughout every phase of the project. We emphasize training, knowledge sharing, and workflow optimization to ensure long-term success. Partnering with us provides access to top-tier consultants who deliver high-quality outcomes, streamline processes, and accelerate timelines while fostering knowledge transfer to strengthen your internal team's Epic expertise.

## Operational Leaders

Operational leaders provide the subject matter expertise and experience needed to circumvent common workflow challenges and help guide the build team towards efficient and sustainable technical solutions geared towards long-term success.

Anchor's deep knowledge of Epic systems allows our team to connect with operational leaders to understand their greatest concerns with a focus on solutioning within Epic. We listen to our clients to uncover the root causes of their day-to-day problems while communicating those needs back to build teams or Anchor analysts in actionable ways. Our experts work within Epic reporting tools to optimize stakeholder reporting needs to help your team stay on top of the daily to-do's that are most critical for your organization.
