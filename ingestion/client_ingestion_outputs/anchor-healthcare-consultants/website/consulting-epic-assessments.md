# Epic Revenue Cycle Application Assessments

Anchor's seasoned Epic architects perform a swift, top-level analysis of system functionality to pinpoint gaps and identify areas for improvement.

## Discover

## Investigate

The team then conducts a high level system review and uses custom-built analytics tools to quantify impacts.

## Report

The review will culminate in a report of findings and recommendations for each area along with any tangible quantitative impacts that can be extrapolated. Anchor will review findings with your team on a short call.
