The tides are constantly changing as healthcare reform initiatives and new industry trends are forcing providers to adapt. Our strategic consulting teams will help identify new approaches for your reimbursement models in order to capitalize on these changes.

We specialize in finding new efficiencies in your revenue cycle workflows to save your organization time and money. We work hard to understand the goals of your organization and tailor our approach to help you achieve them. Our highly customized solutions help to provide enhancements that will continue to provide benefits well into the future.

Let us help you gameplan how to best take advantage of these sweeping changes without compromising your core values as an organization.

###### EHR project success starts from the top down. From day one we bring your operations team on board and discuss areas of improvement. We assess where there are opportunities to better operationalize Epic and harness your existing technologies. Then together we devise a comprehensive timeline and project program that comprises of operational training, workflow enhancements, and system improvements.  We stay engaged as the benefits of the program ripple through your organization before fully transitioning off.   Progress and key deliverables are measured against core metrics that were identified for improvement.

###### OPERATIONAL ENGAGEMENT PROGRAM

The best solutions are often the simplest ones. At Anchor we identify new areas of opportunity for you to fully harness the tools you already possess.  Our comprehensive EHR assessment identifies specific areas within your existing EHR systems for improvement and enhanced end-user experience.

###### EHR ASSESSMENT

###### COMMUNITY CONNECT

Forging EHR partnerships requires careful planning and coordination, beyond simple implementation. As your organization expands EHR access to small practices, Anchor will ease the transition.  We standardize best practices for your organization that strengthen the continuum of care with your patients and close the information and technology gaps between hospital and clinics.

###### MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS

Mergers and acquisitions offer both big opportunities and big challenges . Here at Anchor we offer unmatched support to facilitate a successful transition towards partnership going beyond EHR configuration and leading integrated sessions that help synchronize workflows and cultures across organizations.

###### POPULATION

Transitioning from fee-for-service to value-based reimbursement  brings new challenges to your healthcare organization.   At Anchor we work with Epic’s Healthy Planet module to help you understand and meet the needs of your patient population. Together we can work towards consistent clinical workflows and establish predictive risk models that better serve the needs of your changing patient population. By leveraging your existing EHR data, we help you monitor your community engagement and determine how to better serve your patients.

###### INTEGRATION PROJECTS

No project is one size fits all. At Anchor we understand your healthcare organization requires unique and flexible technical support.  Starting with the standard Epic base, we help breed innovation by supporting third-party integration projects that marry new technologies with existing EHR reporting and functionality.  Our goal is to promote a seamless interaction for your end users while empowering them to harness new tools beyond those which your EHR provides.

###### CODING COMPLIANCE

The goal of coding is to accurately report patient-provider interactions. Yet too often errors in coding to result in “false claims” and billing irregularities. Periodic coding compliance audits help your healthcare organization avoid mistakes and stay up to date with the latest developments in coding claims.  At Anchor we specialize in matching coder/auditor expertise to specific specialty to ensure maximum accuracy. We step in to identify errors within physician and technical coding and present your organization with opportunities for improvement.
