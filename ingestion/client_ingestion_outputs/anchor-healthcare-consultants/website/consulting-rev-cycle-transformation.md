# Revenue Cycle Transformation

## Transformation Project Summary

Anchor’s revenue cycle transformation team works in conjunction with your operational leaders to identify opportunity areas and drive positive outcomes across all areas of the revenue cycle 

*   Patient Access: Financial counseling, patient cost estimation, prior authorization workflows, and referral management.
*   Charge Capture and Coding: Charge capture optimization, clinical documentation improvement, and strategic pricing.
*   Billing and Claims: Accounts receivable strategies, denial management, and self-pay management

During these projects, our consultants will work across all areas to drive tangible results that can be quantified and categorized into some of the following buckets.

# Pillars

- Acceleration
- Improvement
- Cost Reduction
- Risk Reduction

#### REVENUE ACCELERATION

Projects that we anticipate will positively impact cash timelines.

Opportunities in this area can result in faster claim submission, increased denial response timeliness, or streamlined processing of expected balances across primary, secondary and self-pay responsibilities.

## COST REDUCTION

Automation/Process Efficiency: Often Epic optimization opportunities include system improvements that reduce staff workloads or increased efficiencies in existing workflows. Productivity gains in these areas free up users to focus their time on higher impact items.

Direct Cost Savings?

Reduce Reliance on External Vendors: Improving Epic’s effectiveness can reduce the necessity of third-party vendors, creating large cost savings on these services. Streamlined workflows, reductions in overall account, charge, or denial volume, or enhancement to collections processes can all reduce reliance on these vendors.

## REVENUE IMPROVEMENT

A core focus of these transformation projects is to drive cash improvements by increasing overall revenue generation.

Improvements in charge capture and collection percentages have the capacity to improve net cash collection by generating more charge volume and decreasing adjustments (either system or manual).

## FINANCIAL RISK REDUCTION

Some opportunities may not directly impact revenue but present a perceived risk due to non-conformance with regulatory or payor guidelines. These optimizations may not provide a direct cash boost but they do minimize downside risk to future revenue collection by minimizing the potential for takebacks, audits, or other payment-related challenges.

# Projects

## Denials Management

Anchor simplifies collections by managing and mitigating denials to maximize revenue.

Anchor identifies key denial opportunities and works with your team to create an interdisciplinary Enterprise Denials Workgroup. This group will bring together clinical operations, patient financial services, and IT to drive sustainable solutions that address root causes of denials. We assist IT in creating, testing, implementing, and training end-users on high-impact solutions that improve net revenue and cash flow.

Through data analysis, we validate or challenge stakeholder assumptions about denial root causes and financial impact, ensuring targeted, data-driven resolutions. Our approach fosters accountability, tailored education, and structured processes to prevent future denials and sustain long-term results.

## Self-Pay Optimization

Enhanced cash collection from patients comes in many shapes and sizes. Anchor can help your team identify build optimization opportunities related to statements, self-pay payment processing, patient estimates, billing notifications, and MyChart usage to improve self-pay payment percentage and revenue capture from patients.

## Cash Acceleration

Anchor’s hospital billing experts understand the importance of prompt payment for billed claims. Working with operational stakeholders, our team will work to identify opportunities to accelerate cash through identifying cases that require early advancement of cash to next responsible parties.

## Automation

The goal of every organization is to optimize the efficiency of their teams. Epic provides a suite of opportunities for automation throughout the revenue cycle and the Anchor team knows how to tap into those opportunities to further improve performance.

Unlocking these savings is one of the fastest ways to improve your organizational efficiency.
