# A LITTLE BIT  
ABOUT NEPTUNE

### Why Neptune Stands Out

While Epicâ€™s native tools provide strong operational reporting, Neptune differentiates itself by tying analytics directly to financial and configuration impacts. Its structured insights allow healthcare organizations to take actionable steps toward optimizing Epic builds rather than merely identifying broad problem areas.

With its staged development, Epic expertise, and focus on ROI-driven insights, Neptune delivers a powerful alternative to fragmented analytics tools, helping organizations transform their revenue cycle strategy through deeper, more meaningful data analysis.

## Transforming Revenue Cycle Analytics for Epic Clients

Neptune is a revenue cycle analytics platform developed by Anchor Healthcare Consultants, designed specifically for healthcare organizations using Epic. Its primary goal is to surface workflow and system optimization opportunities that enhance financial performance while reducing operational inefficiencies.

Neptune deploys focused analytics across various revenue cycle pain points. The initial assessment tools include:

## Initial Assessments and Functional Modules

### Cash Accelerator-Accelerated NRP

### Consecutive Account Analysis

### Remittance Code Analytics

Identifies payer and system build barriers preventing automated insurance review, estimating potential financial gains from more efficient processes.

Targets post-billing account combination inefficiencies, reducing unnecessary processing effort while improving reconciliation speed.

Determines the most recoverable denied services, automates adjustments for unrecoverable claims, and visualizes remittance volumes by payer, code, mapped action, and recovered amount.
