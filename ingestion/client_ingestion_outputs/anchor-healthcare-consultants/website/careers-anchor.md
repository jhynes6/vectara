We offer opportunities nationwide with flexible hours and generous benefits.

### EPIC REVENUE CYCLE CONSULTANT

A specialized consultant with deep expertise in Epic’s suite of revenue cycle applications, including Resolute Professional and Hospital Billing, Cadence, Prelude, and Claims. This expert configures, optimizes, and supports Epic modules to streamline front-to-back-end revenue cycle operations—from patient registration and scheduling to billing, collections, and reimbursement. Skilled in workflow analysis, system integration, and end-user training, they work closely with operational and IT teams to drive adoption, ensure compliance, and improve financial performance. Their knowledge of Epic’s capabilities and healthcare revenue cycle best practices positions them as a critical resource for implementation, optimization, and transformation initiatives.

### REVENUE CYCLE OPERATIONS

A strategic leader responsible for overseeing the full spectrum of the healthcare revenue cycle, including patient access, billing, coding, reimbursement, and collections. The Revenue Cycle Director or VP drives organizational performance by aligning financial operations with clinical workflows, ensuring regulatory compliance, and optimizing revenue capture. With a focus on operational efficiency and data-driven decision-making, they lead cross-functional teams, implement enterprise-wide systems (such as Epic), and guide initiatives that improve cash flow, reduce denials, and enhance the patient financial experience.

### REVENUE CYCLE TRANSFORMATION CONSULTANT

A Revenue Cycle Transformation Consultant partners with healthcare organizations to modernize and optimize their end-to-end revenue cycle operations. Leveraging data analytics, technology platforms (including Epic and third-party applications), and industry best practices, they assess current-state workflows, identify root causes of inefficiencies or revenue leakage, and design future-state models aligned with organizational goals. They often lead cross-functional teams through change management efforts, system redesigns, and the implementation of digital tools or automation to enhance productivity, reduce denials, and ensure regulatory compliance. Their role is pivotal in supporting healthcare providers' financial sustainability while navigating the evolving landscape of value-based care, interoperability, and patient-centered financial engagement.

### PROJECT LEADER

A results-driven leader responsible for planning, executing, and delivering technology initiatives that support clinical, operational, and financial goals within a healthcare provider organization. This role bridges the gap between technical teams and healthcare stakeholders, ensuring projects align with strategic priorities such as EHR optimization (e.g., Epic or Cerner), system integrations, digital health, and revenue cycle transformation. With strong skills in cross-functional team leadership, stakeholder engagement, and change management, the project leader ensures timely delivery, regulatory compliance, and user adoption—driving innovation and value across the healthcare technology landscape.
