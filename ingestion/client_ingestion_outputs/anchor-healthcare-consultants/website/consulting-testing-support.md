# Testing Support

## Services

### Comprehensive Testing

Well-executed and comprehensive testing ensures the software will work optimally for both patients and care-givers throughout your organization. Anchor will thoroughly validate all project build so that your planning and hard work pays off. Anchor’s rigorous testing approach guarantees that your hard work translates into a smooth, reliable go-live experience for both patients and caregivers.

### Testing Strategy & Execution

Our methodology builds upon Epic’s testing framework, ensuring clear expectations, efficient communication, and a stable testing environment. By rigorously defining testing scripts and processes, while continuously assessing risks, we minimize disruption and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, operational workflows, financial stability, and patient safety.

### Technical Testing

A successful go-live requires more than just software validation. Our experts guide your team through critical hardware, workstation, and printing tests to ensure a seamless user experience. From technical dress rehearsals to system-wide performance assessments, our expanded testing solutions go beyond standard implementation to deliver a fully optimized EHR environment.

## Mission Critical Testing Efforts

Integrated Testing ensures that all Epic modules and connected systems work together seamlessly. This process validates end-to-end workflows across departments-such as registration, clinical documentation, billing, and ancillary systems-to confirm that data flows accurately and processes function as intended throughout the patient journey.

* If not executed properly:
    * Critical workflows may break down, leading to failures in patient registration, order entry, billing, or clinical documentation.
    * Data may not flow correctly between departments, causing delays, lost information, or errors in patient care and billing.
    * Integration gaps can result in operational inefficiencies and increased manual workarounds.

## Parallel Revenue Cycle Testing

Parallel Revenue Cycle Testing involves leveraging legacy documentation to test those same revenue cycle scenarios in Epic and compare results. Legacy workflows often do not align with Epic’s best practices. Attempting to replicate outdated processes in Epic can result in inefficiencies, while over-customization can create unnecessary complexity. This approach identifies discrepancies in billing, claims, and payments, ensuring the new Epic system produces accurate financial outcomes before full cutover.

* If not executed properly:
    * Significant discrepancies in billing, claims, and payments may go undetected, resulting in revenue leakage, increased denials, or missed charges after go-live.
    * Organizations may experience cash flow disruptions and find it difficult to identify the root cause of financial variances.
    * Failure to catch errors can lead to prolonged stabilization periods and financial instability post-cutover.

## Application Testing

Application Testing focuses on validating the functionality of individual Epic modules or applications. Each application is tested to ensure it meets requirements, performs correctly in isolation, and handles both typical and edge-case scenarios, reducing the risk of defects at go-live.

* Modules may not perform as expected, leading to broken features, user frustration, and workflow interruptions.
* Unidentified defects can cause patient safety issues, billing errors, or compliance risks.
* Providers may lose confidence in the system, reducing adoption and increasing reliance on manual processes.

## Upgrade Testing

Upgrade Testing is performed when new versions or updates are applied to Epic. This testing verifies that enhancements or patches do not disrupt existing workflows, integrations, or customizations, and that all new features function as expected. Communication of these changes to impacted users along with some user-acceptance testing is also key.

* If not executed properly:
    * New features may not function correctly, or existing workflows could break, leading to operational downtime or data loss.
    * Unaddressed compatibility issues can cause system instability, impacting both clinical and revenue cycle operations.
    * Users may experience confusion or errors due to unexpected system changes.

## Charge Testing

Charge Testing validates that clinical activities and documentation in Epic and upstream clinical systems generate the correct charges, codes, and billing events. This process ensures charge capture accuracy, minimizes missed revenue opportunities, and supports compliance with billing regulations.

* If not executed properly:
    * Missed or incorrect charges can result in lost revenue, compliance violations, and increased audit risk.
    * Charge capture errors may go unnoticed, leading to underbilling or overbilling and patient dissatisfaction.
    * Post-cutover, organizations may struggle to reconcile financial reports and maintain revenue integrity.

## Technical/Hardware Testing

Assesses the performance and compatibility of the infrastructure supporting Epic, including servers, devices, and network components. This testing ensures the system is reliable, responsive, and able to handle expected user volumes without technical issues.

* If not executed properly:
    * System performance issues, downtime, or hardware failures can disrupt clinical operations and revenue cycle processes.
    * Inadequate capacity planning may lead to slow response times, user frustration, and reduced productivity.
    * Integration failures with external devices or systems can cause data loss or workflow breakdowns.

Thorough testing is essential before rolling out any new build, ensuring that workflow processes, user interfaces, and third-party integrations function seamlessly. Anchor serves as a reliable and organized partner, offering extensive experience across all phases of the Epic implementation cycle. Our proven testing methodology guarantees that your team is prepared to advance through each project phase with confidence.

Our consultants bring expertise across all Epic applications, third-party integrations, and interface configurations, working closely with leadership teams to:

* Manage and coordinate all testing phases and resources.
* Define testing ground rules and expectations for efficient execution.
* Provide expert support in test program design, leadership, and execution.

We follow a comprehensive testing strategy that aligns with Epic’s framework, ensuring clear expectations, streamlined communication, and a stable testing environment. Our approach minimizes disruptions by rigorously defining testing scripts, continuously assessing risks, and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, operational workflows, financial stability, and patient safety.

Beyond software validation, our team supports technical testing to ensure a seamless go-live experience. We guide your team through hardware, workstation, and printing tests, conducting technical dress rehearsals and system-wide performance assessments to deliver a fully optimized EHR environment that enhances reliability and reduces risk.
