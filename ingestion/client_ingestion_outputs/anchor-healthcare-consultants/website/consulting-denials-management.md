# Denials Management

Anchor simplifies collections by managing and mitigating denials to maximize revenue. We identify root causes of denials, rework, and lost revenue, partnering with you to implement solutions across key departments.

Our approach includes analyzing denial data, assigning root causes, and calculating achievable net revenue improvements. We assess financial impact by comparing current performance to industry benchmarks, determining net revenue improvement potential and cash acceleration based on open denials. To establish a minimum improvement threshold, we quantify discrete issues driving denials write-offs and delayed payments.

Anchor identifies key denial opportunities and works with your team to create an interdisciplinary Enterprise Denials Workgroup. This group will bring together clinical operations, patient financial services, and IT to drive sustainable solutions that address root causes of denials. We assist IT in creating, testing, implementing, and training end-users on high-impact solutions that improve net revenue and cash flow.

Through data analysis, we validate or challenge stakeholder assumptions about denial root causes and financial impact, ensuring targeted, data-driven resolutions. Our approach fosters accountability, tailored education, and structured processes to prevent future denials and sustain long-term results.
