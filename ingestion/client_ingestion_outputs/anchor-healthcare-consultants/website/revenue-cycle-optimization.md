## REVENUE CYCLE

Revenue Cycle Operations Should Be a Driving Force for Your Organization

At Anchor we are experts at navigating the shifting landscape of payor, provider and patient needs.

Optimizing the revenue cycle requires looking beyond billing. Financial performance is not strictly a financial issue- rather it is a strategic, operational and technological issue. Anchorâ€™s team of experts takes a comprehensive approach to the revenue cycle. We design and implement custom plans to optimize your financial performance. We start by defining key focus areas to understand the core areas for improvement within the billing cycle. Next in-depth strategy sessions are held with your IT and operational teams to target these areas. After completing a detailed analysis of your focus areas, we devise an in-depth project proposal providing configuration recommendations centered on key deliverables. During project execution phase, our experienced consultants work closely with you to ensure all goals are met. The project culminates in a final delivery presentation where maintenance documents are provided to your IT team for long-term support of the deliverables.
