## Revenue Stabilization

## CFB Reduction

High frequency edits require large amounts of manual review by end users, taking resources away from higher priority efforts. Reducing redundant and unnecessary edits can free up these end users to focus their attention on more substantial issues. In addition, high dollar edits can hold up valuable AR dollars and prevent prompt submission of high expected value claims. Lastly, timely submission of claims can be impacted in cases where accounts are held up by edits across the billing cycle. Anchor can perform a thorough review of all edits (charge review, DNB, claim edits) to highlight areas where editing can be updated. Potential solutions will involve changes to edits, added automation to prevent editing, and review of upstream workflows with end users to reduce edit volume downstream.
