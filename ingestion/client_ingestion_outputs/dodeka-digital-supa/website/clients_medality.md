# Helping the industry-leading radiology learning platform rebrand and expand into new markets

Medality is the recent expansion of MRI Online, the leading resource for online learning for radiologists.

## THE CHALLENGE

### Growing into new markets, while building on existing brand awareness

MRI Online had been primarily targeted to radiologists themselves, while Medality was aiming to take a more strategic approach and partner with healthcare organizations.  
This kind of shift required not only an update in product strategy and positioning, but also in messaging, imagery, and the whole go-to-market plan. The goal was to leverage the positive reputation MRI Online had built, while growing into a more B2B-focused brand.

## Website

### Crafting a modern digital presence

We partnered with Medality to strategize and build the site from scratch, including building the site map, and providing copy templates and structures for all of the pages. Once Medality wrote the content, we then brought it to life visually, crafting the graphics and modules necessary to present the information.  
The result was a responsive, modern site that elegantly showcases the value that Medality brings to radiologists, and their employers.

## Thought leadership content

To showcase its credibility within the new market, Medality leveraged its in-house team of experts and industry-leading data sets to craft compelling, long-form content to educate the radiology market.  
Dodeka partnered with them to bring this content to life visually in a way that told the story of the data in an actionable and compelling format.

## THE Outcome

### Amid its market expansion, Medality has experienced triple-digit growth, and doesn't look to be slowing down anytime soon.
