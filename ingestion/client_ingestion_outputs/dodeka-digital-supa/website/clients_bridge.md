## About Bridge

Bridge is an all-in-one communication platform built for independent insurance agents. They take the multitude of tools agents need, and combine them in one place, saving agents countless amounts of time, and money.

## THE CHALLENGE

### Scaling growth through digital

Bridge had been a primarily sales-led organization, and was looking for a way to increase their inbound leads and revenue through digital channels.

## Solution

### Building an inbound engine

Dodeka partnered with Bridge to build a multi-channel marketing campaign to help reach new prospects and increase inbound demos, while building a sales and marketing flywheel.

## Website

### Crafting a modern digital presence

During Bridge's growth, their website had taken a back seat, and the messaging and design was no longer representative of their modern product.

Dodeka re-built the entire sitemap with a mind towards user experience, and SEO. After re-structuring the site to better represent Bridge's offerings, we designed a fresh, modern, and responsive site, that paid tribute to the innovation they've showcased in their product for years.

## Landing Pages

Even the most engaging ads are rendered ineffective without an engaging destination. So we a/b tested over 10 landing pages until we found a winning combination that now drives high value, qualified conversions.

## Demand Generation

### Capturing Demand Through SEO and PPC

Many insurance agents were looking for the solution Bridge provides, but since they weren't optimized for Google or Bing search, the prospects were never even aware of their existence.

We worked to rectify this quickly through paid (PPC) and unpaid (SEO) efforts, aiming for quick wins, while building for sustainable long-term growth.

## Thought leadership content

Now that prospects were becoming more aware of Bridge, we wanted to help them build credibility within the space by showcasing their vast level of technical and industry expertise.

Building high-value thought leadership content (ebooks, whitepapers, blogs, etc.) started to drive both awareness and engagement with new prospects, furthering Bridge's credibility, and diversifying their interactions with clients.

## Branding

### Evolving Bridge's Visual Identity

We overhauled the Bridge brand through a new logo, color system, typography, and custom iconography.

## THE Outcome

#### Within the first year of our partnership, we've built Bridge a sustainable, repeatable demand-generation process, driving inbound revenue, while also creating a continuous feedback loop with the sales team.
