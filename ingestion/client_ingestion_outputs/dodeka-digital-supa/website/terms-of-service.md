# Terms of Service

**Last Updated:** October 31, 2024

Thank you for choosing Dodeka Digital. By accessing our website, engaging with our Services, or making payments through our online payment page via Stripe or HubSpot, you agree to comply with and be bound by the following Terms of Service. Please review these terms carefully, and if you disagree with any part, please refrain from using our services.

### 1. Scope of Services

Dodeka Digital provides digital marketing, website development, and related professional services (“Services”). Details of the specific services are outlined in our Master Service Agreement and individual Scope of Work agreements, which govern project deliverables, timelines, fees, and any service-specific conditions.

### 2. Payments & Billing

#### 2.1. Fees

Service fees are determined in advance through our Master Service Agreement or Scope of Work agreement. Fees may include project-based charges, monthly retainers, or other specified charges as outlined in these agreements.

#### 2.2. Payment Terms

Payments are securely processed through Stripe and HubSpot. By initiating payment, you authorize Dodeka Digital to charge the agreed-upon amount to your selected payment method. For ongoing services, you authorize recurring charges per the terms in the service agreement, unless canceled or terminated in accordance with those terms.

#### 2.3. Late Payments

Late payments may incur a fee and could result in the suspension or termination of services. For additional details on late payment terms, please refer to your Master Service Agreement or Scope of Work.

### 3. Refund Policy

Due to the nature of our digital services, refunds are generally not available once work has commenced. In special circumstances, including project cancellations, refund eligibility will be assessed on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the terms in the applicable agreement.

### 4. Intellectual Property

Unless otherwise specified in writing, Dodeka Digital retains ownership of any proprietary materials, tools, and processes developed during the course of providing Services. Upon receipt of final payment, you will have ownership of all final deliverables as specified in your agreement, excluding any proprietary or third-party materials.

### 5. Confidentiality

Both Dodeka Digital and the client agree to maintain the confidentiality of any sensitive or proprietary information shared during the course of the project. Information will only be disclosed as required to fulfill the agreement or comply with applicable laws.

### 6. Limitation of Liability

Dodeka Digital will not be liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use or performance of our Services. Our liability will be limited to the amount paid for the specific Service related to any claim. This limitation does not apply in cases of gross negligence or intentional misconduct.

### 7. Termination

Both parties have the right to terminate Services upon written notice. If terminated, you agree to pay for all services rendered up to the date of termination. Please refer to your Master Service Agreement or Scope of Work for further termination terms.

### 8. Modifications to Terms

We may update these Terms of Service periodically to reflect changes in our practices, legal requirements, or other operational factors. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting. We encourage you to review this page regularly.

### 9. Governing Law

These Terms of Service are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of North Carolina, United States. Any disputes arising from these terms or your use of our Services will be resolved through binding arbitration, unless otherwise stated in the applicable agreement.
