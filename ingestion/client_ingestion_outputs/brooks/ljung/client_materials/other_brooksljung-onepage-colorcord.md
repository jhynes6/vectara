Color Cord Company was operating email in-house, but their strategy leaned heavily on
monthly discounts and promotions. We stepped in to ﬂip the approach, replacing promo-heavy
messaging with elevated full-price campaigns, smarter segmentation, and a reﬁned brand look
and feel. In just the ﬁrst month, Color Cord Company was generating 3x more email revenue
(YOY) without relying on discounts. The result? Higher-margin growth and a dramatically
stronger revenue channel.
