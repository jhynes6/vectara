Service Differentiation

What makes you different from your competitors? What is your “special sauce”?
 Unlike others in our space, we place a lot of emphasis on brand and design. This is especially important in a world of so many lookalike companies. Many agencies will offer web design and development services, but won’t offer much around brand strategy, brand voice, and content development. This results in ecommerce experiences that may look nice but fall flat with their messaging and design. There’s nothing to differentiate them from the many others just like them, and nothing that tells their prospective customers why they should shop with them. 
 When it comes to email marketing or campaign development, many agencies will lead with their expertise around data, which is important, but then fall flat on creating email or campaign content that drives customers to take action and ultimately convert. With our emphasis on brand and design, we excel over these other agencies at creating campaigns that resonate with target customers and elevate the brand we’re representing.   

Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? What do you do to improve their business?
 PROBLEM: My email channel isn’t performing as well as my peers. It seems that our customers are only engaging with promotional messaging, and I don’t know how to turn that around. We have a couple of automated campaigns running (welcome, abandoned cart) but they’re not contributing much revenue each month. Our email sales contribute only about 10% to 15% to our total ecom sales. We’re doing email campaigns ourselves, but it gets in the way of our daily operations and never does as well as I hope.
 SOLUTION: We developed an email strategy that reengaged customers with full-price messaging and drove incredible growth through weekly email marketing as well as automated campaigns based on user behaviors.
 Sales Attributed to Email Marketing (Campaigns + Flows): +116.3% YOY
 CAMPAIGN PERFORMANCE
 Total Revenue: +91.3%
 Conversion Rate: +56.2%
 Revenue per Recipient: +70%
 FLOWS PERFORMANCE
 Total Revenue: +216.8%
 Conversion +269.9%
 Revenue per Recipient: +324.7%
 PROBLEM: I started our business about 5 years ago with a clear vision of who our company is and what we stand for. We’ve made a lot of decisions along the way that have shaped what we look like, sound like, and how customers interact with us and understand our product/service offering. However, our brand is not where I think it should be. I have it all in my head, but have a hard time boiling it down to something as simple as a brand positioning statement, and clarifying who we are, why we exist, and why you should choose us over the competition. I think we may need an aesthetic refresh as well.
 SOLUTION: Our team dives deep into the industry landscape, uncovers what's consistent and inconsistent about the current brand direction, and finds areas of opportunity or further differentiation. We will also speak with leadership and team members to better understand the current brand story and message. We move into a brand development phase that begins with our team running you through a series of brand exercises over a 2-hour period. The exercises are designed to pull out insights about the organization's purpose, vision, and desired impact. We walk away from the session with raw ingredients that we then go to work on. Taking what we learned from the audit phase and where we see a unique opportunity, and combining that with the insights from the brand exercises, we then craft the Brand Brief. The Brand Brief acts as a GPS for the organization and guides all our marketing and communications efforts moving forward. The Brand Brief is made up of:
 Attributes
 Core Purpose (why the organization exists)
 Big Hairy Audacious Goal (or long-term vision)
 Positioning Statement
 Value Proposition
 Big Idea (a single unifying statement or promise for the brand)
 Brand Narrative (how we tie all these elements together into one cohesive story)
 Implementation (examples of how these elements all come together and get expressed in different ways through campaigns and creative)
 PROBLEM: We have a website (note: typically these are on Shopify, but we work on all platforms) that we built ourselves. It looks okay, but conversion rate and sales are low. We keep trying new apps to increase our conversion but we haven’t found the silver bullet.
 SOLUTION: Our web design service combines data-driven insights with exceptional design to increase conversion rates and deliver best-in-class product presentations. We craft user experiences that minimize friction and leverage our branding expertise to clearly communicate who you are, what you sell, and why customers should care—ensuring your website doesn’t just look great but works smarter to achieve your goals.

Case Studies and Previous Customer Successes

For each service, what are case studies or recent customer successes that you use to highlight your expertise in your field?
 ADDED 10/15: We just took on a new client in the Women’s Contemporary Fashion space, focussing on email marketing. This client was already doing email marketing, running the program in-house, but struggling to generate significant revenue.
 In the first 30 days of working together, we’ve increased their open rate by +69%, click rate +42%, conversion +100%, and revenue per recipient has grown by +43%.
