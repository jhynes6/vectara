Campaign Criteria

Targeting

Describe your top three target personas (clients): 
 We provide strategic support, ecommerce store management, design/development, digital advertising, email marketing and SEO services to businesses running on the Shopify ecommerce platform. Typically clients are between 2-20M in revenue. 
 Industries: ecomm(Shopify)
 Titles: ecomm titles(manager or director), CMO, VP of Marketing, upper level marketing titles
 HC: 2-20
 Are there industries you won’t sell to? 
 Some ecommerce businesses are very specialized, so it could make sense to avoid those. We have ton of experience with consumer goods - electronics, apparel, motorcycles, musical equipment, action sports, etc.

Offerings

What services do you sell to your top 3 target personas? (ex. PPC, Social Content, Email Marketing) 
 Mentioned above
 For each service, what are your top offers (packages/examples) that you would be willing to pitch them?
 We’ll need to discuss this. We typically don’t offer free services other than an initial audit of their digital ecosystem.

Cost of Services

What is your average order value? What are your “Starting At” costs for your services?
 Typically we require a 5K client minimum, but we often average between 7500 and 12500 given that most clients use multiple services like email and advertising as well as some development.

Service Differentiation

What makes you different from your competitors? What is your “special sauce”?
 Honestly our difference is that we walk the talk. Most agencies claim to be strategic, but they only know how to execute tactics. We know what it takes to move the needle and we do it at great rates because we are all remote. Essentially we do what we say we’re going to do and it works.

Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? What do you do to improve their business?
 (ex: My clothing line has stopped reaching new buyers and we want to break into a new niche. Facebook keeps getting more expensive and makes it hard to target new buyers.
 Solution: Organic UGC content is the perfect mechanism to branch out to new customers. We help you find influencers who are exactly like your target audience, work with them to create videos and then use those videos to penetrate your new niche audience.)
 Agencies are a dime a dozen and most don’t really know how to move the needle. We have worked in our careers with very large and very small clients and we understand the recipe for success and have applied those skills over and over again. When clients have the money to spend, we can partner up and make great things happen.

Case Studies and Previous Customer Successes

For each service, what are case studies or recent customer successes that you use to highlight your expertise in your field?
 (ex: generated 50k in net new sales in 30 days for a service business with a seasonal email marketing campaign)
 (ex: generated 120k in net new revenue with a GenZ-focused organic TikTok Campaign) 
 (ex: increased CTR by 240% and sign ups by 318% with Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo Campaign)
 This is on the website - We could add a new one for Forloh though…Burton, Keurig, Ben & Jerrys

Current Client List:


For our part, we’re a 1% for the Planet agency that’s donated $100k+ to environmental non-profits 


l partnerships, were especially helpful for Reyn Spooner -- over the last three years we have grown their revenue by at least 60% YOY.


Seeing how we have a long track record working with packaged food brands like Ben & Jerry’s (6 years) and Keurig Dr Pepper (15 years), I thought I’d reach out and see if {{company_name}} had any resource gaps.
