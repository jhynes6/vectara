# 5 Benefits of Outsourced Marketing Partnership

Depending on the size of your business, you may rely on multiple freelance resources, have a small internal group, or an in-house marketing department constantly flooded with work. Regardless of the depth of your organization, there are great benefits that come from partnering with an external, full-scale marketing team. Whether it is to lead a new initiative, take on something that is not in the wheelhouse of your internal team, or simply to add bandwidth to your organization, the level and type of support offered by an outside partnership are completely flexible.

Areas of expertise can cover the full spectrum of needs in the B2B and B2C realms. A partnership with the right agency will save you time and money so you can keep more of those precious resources available to prioritize other (perhaps more pressing) business initiatives. Finding an agency partner that can handle multiple channels will streamline the process and be an arm of your internal team.

Not all marketing partners are alike. Some specialize in a certain niche, while others offer a full-service team to focus on the whole ecosystem. So let’s get to it.

## Here are our top five benefits of working with a marketing partner agency.

### 1. Broad Experience

By engaging the right agency, you can gain access to people that have direct expertise with clients, industries, and projects of all sizes. This experience not only expands the scope of your exposure to new ideas, it can help bring a diverse mindset that can steer successful outcomes. Stirring up the pot, so to speak, can help your company devise new solutions to old problems. As a result, a fresh perspective can lead to new ideas and drive new innovations.

### 2. Up-to-Date Skill Sets

As a diverse team of specialists, an agency will have resources on their team with various—and most importantly—up-to-date skill sets. You have access to the full bench of the partner agency. Examples include:

* **Digital advertisers** that are up-to-speed on the latest trends such as iOS updates
* **Facebook and Instagram specialists** that are in on the latest regulations
* **E-commerce quarterbacks** that know the latest trends and strategies for successful storefronts
* **Branding experts** that will bring your brand to life and reach your ideal customers
* **Digital designers** who know more about pixel dimensions and button placements than anyone should
* **Print designers** that will see a die line and know how to put all of the pieces together to catch your potential customers on the shelf
* **Project managers** that will keep the machine running smoothly

### 3. Budget Efficiency

Most agencies can efficiently manage various projects or provide ongoing support at prices that equate to one or two employees. The distinct advantage with an agency partnership is that it may include resources and skills far beyond what one or two resources could manage effectively. Within the agency model, you could have a CMO-level strategist working a few hours per week, an eCommerce quarterback at 10 hours per week and, advertisers with email and/or SMS experts working for the same price as a single senior resource. Working with one agency and consolidating a few of the services will provide efficiencies and streamline your workflows—saving you time and money.

### 4. Management / Air Traffic Controllers

Businesses often hire individual freelance resources to manage various aspects of their marketing needs, but managing all of the disparate towards successful outcomes can be a challenge and take up the time of your internal resources. When you partner with an agency, the management of resources is built into the partnership—so you can focus on what's most important: running your business and keeping an eye on your bottom line.

### 5. Flexible, Deep Bench

Agencies can scale up and down on their side so you don’t have to. They can offer diversity in specific areas of discipline, including project management and workflow expertise, GTM strategies, the best vendors and apps to get a project launched, and knowledge on the latest processes to bring it all together. This allows for efficiency in executing your initiatives with a fresh eye, while boosting energy and engagement into every project. As your needs evolve, your team can be adjusted to match the initiative.

## Benefits of a Long-Term Partnership

There are numerous benefits you will find when working with partner agencies (like BucklandCo). Let’s be honest: not all agencies are created equal. It takes more than a menu of appropriate services to make a long-term partnership. When you find an agency that is a great fit for you, they will become part of your team—a true partner that matches your priority level and vision for your projects.

BucklandCo offers a suite of interconnected services to our clients depending on the type and needs of their business. Not everyone will need everything we offer—and that is fine with us as long as we feel like we can add value and provide complete satisfaction to our clients.
