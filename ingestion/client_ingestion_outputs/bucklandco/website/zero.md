## How Zero Motorcycles Revved Up  
to Increase Sales and Leads

Zero Motorcycles is one of the only 100% electric motorcycle companies and they needed a solid strategy and digital campaign to increase awareness and sales. We launched and scaled global advertising efforts across Google Search, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and Programmatic Display that has resulted in significant growth in lead volume both in the US (+47%) and Europe (+350%) over the past several years

### What we did.

*   Maintained high levels of engagement and conversions through creative and message testing across audiences to find what resonates most with a potential Zero buyer.  
*   Worked with the brand to combat against “petrol heads”, consumers that are die-hard gas powered motorcycle fans to create messaging to speak to and sway these users opinions over time.  
*   Managed technology evolutions over the years with no data or reporting issues occur during transitional periods.  
*   Our full funnel approach has become more lean, but also more efficient, to ensure the highest volume of quality leads that set dealerships up to close sales.
