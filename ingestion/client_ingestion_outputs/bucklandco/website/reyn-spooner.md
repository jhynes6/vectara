## How Classic Reyn Spooner Became  
Relevant With a Younger Audience

For over 60 years, Reyn Spooner has built a legacy of craftsmanship and design, with Aloha in every stitch of their classic shirts. Their pieces are passed down to the next generation and become heirlooms. To ensure the next generation continues this tradition, we developed a digital advertising strategy that exceeded sales goals and engagement with a new target audience 20 years younger than their average consumer.

### What we did.

*   Increased revenue by +220% since the start of our partnership
*   Collaborated with the internal design team to continually test creative which resulted in a 30% increase in engagement across channels.  
*   Creative testing has allowed the brand to reach and resonate with a younger audience, effectively decreasing the average age of their customer by nearly 20 years, which has been a goal of the brand for years.
*   Continue to scale ad spend each year with consistent high returns through on-going testing of audiences and creative.
