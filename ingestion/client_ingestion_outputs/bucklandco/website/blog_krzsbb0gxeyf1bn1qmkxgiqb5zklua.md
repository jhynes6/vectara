# Ditch The Standard Approach To Resolutions And Start Here...

Ditch the standard approach to resolutions, and start here...

I often use an expression - “people are really good at being themselves.”

I say it all the time, typically when someone is expressing surprise over behavior, when that behavior is seen over and over again. How can you be surprised when the same behavior shows up time and time again? Without support most people and businesses are just a series of Groundhog Days that tend to repeat past behaviors over and over again. Do you want this year to be different? Do you want to actually stick to your goals and make a difference? Cool.

Here is the key. After you make the list of all the things you want to create in the new year, you have to step back and focus on one thing, not 10. If you try and instill too many at once you will inevitably fall off the wagon and return to your default state.

Instead – look at your list and ask yourself a focusing question like, “what is the one item on this list that, if accomplished or progressing, will make everything else easier or unnecessary?”  
For most, it’s something related to diet or exercise or not falling back into the same habits, simply recreating their Groundhog Day.

Pick one item, tell a close friend or your spouse what you are going to do differently for the next 21 days. Text them every day, or give them an update, this will help you hold yourself accountable. Ask them to check in every day if you don’t by the time you are supposed to. This works.  
We’ve done this with scores of clients and the results are always the same. Once you can do something for 3 straight weeks, you are good. Old habit gone, new habit in place.  
So start with what will bring the biggest impact and then add a new item every 21 days. You won’t recognize your day, or your old self, if you can stick with this approach.
