## How Ben & Jerry’s Needed a Leader  
and Extension To Their Marketing Team

Ben and Jerry’s is a business that came together in 1978 by two men who built a legendary business of homemade ice cream. As the company has grown tremendously over the years, the need for a great partnership has grown. To help fill a big internal role, we jumped in to become an “eye in the sky” and a leader between Ben and Jerry’s and other large agencies.

### What we did.

*   Strategic oversight and management of Ben and Jerry’s internal marketing team and agency partners.  
*   Served as an extension of the leadership team to help manage the transitions as the organization evolved.
