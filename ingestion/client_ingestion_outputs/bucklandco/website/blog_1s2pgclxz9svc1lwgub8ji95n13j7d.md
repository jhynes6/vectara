# Three Elements to Power Past Your Competition

There are a couple questions I’m asked all the time, like:

*   “What are the secrets to having a successful business?”
*   “How do I take my team or business to the next level?”

The question comes in all shapes and sizes, but essentially they’re all getting at the same need.

While I could take this response in any number of directions, the primary building blocks for a great company are how projects, people and budgets are managed. It’s that … wait for it … easy. But that’s just it, businesses that really “get it” understand how these elements need to work together, and it’s why they consistently charge ahead to meet or exceed goals.

Some folks wonder how companies outpace their competition time and time again, but the approach is really quite simple when you break it down. They discover the projects and initiatives that will make a difference. They plan for the resources and budget they will need to get after it. And then they execute efficiently and effectively.

In each case, they review what they could do better next time. They learn from the experience – each time. The first two points (priority and resources) start like an equation, the third (excellence of execution) improves with diligence and should begin to isolate how to improve the whole.

So let’s boil it down to what you need:

*   People: To achieve greatness, you need great people, great vision and a “why” for your business. Doing great things starts with a culture of people on a mission to do something collectively meaningful. If your people are charged and ready to rock, that will make most of the difference. Good talent becomes great talent when the mission is clear.
*   Projects: Every company needs a methodology to discover, review and plan for the strategic projects and initiatives making the biggest impact for their business. This process needs to look at all the could and should have’s and narrow the focus to the must have’s. Once the most important projects have been identified, a planning process to lay out what resources (internal or external), time and budget is needed to execute effectively.
*   Budgets: Without the money you won’t be able to secure the resources needed for the most important work. Many businesses are hesitant to spend the funds needed to get after the important pieces of the puzzle. I cannot stress enough that there is a much bigger cost when they don’t. Settling for being stuck, or No. 2, when your gut knows it can have, and wants more, is soul zapping.

If you don’t have resources that can get after what’s most important, it’s time to find a partner that can provide this support. Sit back, ponder and think about what is really keeping you in your current pattern. If you want, you can stay right where you are. Or, you can find the courage to fulfill the vision of what’s possible. So, it’s my turn to ask a question, “which do you want?” We both know the answer.
