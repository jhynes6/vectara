## How IceMule Increased Customer  
Engagement With Email and SMS Marketing

The ICEMULE™ resulted from a simple need: to carry a real cooler - one that carries real ice - comfortably and easily. To better reach their outdoor enthusiast target audience, we developed a strategic approach to manage their monthly email and SMS content plan from start to finish, A/B testing and analytics tracking, and frequent flow redesigns.

### What we did.

*   Collaborated with Icemule’s marketing team to develop and execute an email strategy to increase customer engagement.
*   Through testing and analytics tracking we have been able to learn customer preferences, behaviors and apply learnings to email strategy to increase AOV and CVR’s.
