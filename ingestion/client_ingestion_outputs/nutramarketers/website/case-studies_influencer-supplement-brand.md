# From Viral Influence to Iconic Brand: How Ashton Hall Launched Worthy Supps with NutraMarketers

##### _When one of the most-followed fitness influencers in the world decided to launch his own supplement brand, he trusted NutraMarketers to make it happen._

##### Background

## **Turning Influence into Ownership**

With 29.9M+ followers across TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, Ashton Hall is one of the most recognized fitness influencers on the planet.

After years of promoting powerhouse brands like MuscleTech and Dymatize, Ashton knew it was time to take the next step: owning his brand. Endorsement deals pay the bills, but they leave a massive business opportunity on the table.

With millions of engaged followers, Ashton had the perfect audience to launch a product he could truly stand behind. One he’d use himself and confidently recommend to his fans. That vision became Worthy Supps.

#### But success in the crowded $152B supplement industry takes more than influence. Ashton needed an expert partner who understood formulation, compliance, branding, and multi-channel launch strategy. That’s when he partnered with NutraMarketers.

##### **Strategy:**

## **Building a Brand Worthy of Its Name**

When you have nearly 30 million fans watching your every move, your brand has to stand out from day one. Here’s how we did it:

1.  Product Strategy

We launched with two hero products, each with two flavors:

*   **Whey Protein Isolate – Cinnamon Toast Crunch + Cocoa Crunch**
*   ******Pre-Workout** –** Sweet Watermelon + Strawberry Lemonade**

Cereal-inspired flavors were trending, and they were Ashton’s personal favorites. By combining personal taste with audience insights, we created a flavor lineup designed to connect emotionally with his community.

#### **2\. Premium Formulation**

For Ashton, this wasn’t about slapping his name on a generic tub, it was about quality.

Partnering with Superior Supplements Manufacturing, we built formulas designed to outperform category leaders:

##### **Nutrition Facts Panel High-lights**

##### **Protein:**

*   25g premium whey protein isolate per scoop
*   110 calories, 2g carbs, 1g sugar
*   No fillers,  just clean, effective nutrition
*   Better taste and performance than Premier Protein, Orgain, and Isopure

#####  **Pre-Workout:**

*   200mg caffeine + focus enhancers
*   Clean, lasting energy without jitters or crash
*   No artificial fillers

## **Brand Identity: Designing a Brand Worthy of a Celebrity**

#### When you’re building a supplement brand for someone with nearly 30 million followers, you can’t just create a product, you have to create a movement. Worthy Supps needed to look, sound, and feel premium. It had to be bold enough to match Ashton’s personality, modern enough to connect with his audience, and timeless enough to stand alongside global lifestyle brands.

##### Our process went deep:

### **Brand Personality Workshop**

Before touching a logo or a label, we worked with Ashton to uncover the DNA of his personal brand, his vision, voice, and what he wanted Worthy Supps to represent. This wasn’t just about aesthetics. It was about defining how the brand should make people feel: empowered, elite, and part of something bigger.

### **Visual Brandscapes (Three Iterations)**

We explored multiple creative directions before landing on the final look:

*   *   Masculine yet polished
*   Bold yet approachable
*   Trend-driven but not trendy. Something luxury-inspired that could stand the test of time

The end result? A visual identity strong enough for Ashton, but versatile enough that celebrities like Deion Sanders or Kanye West could stand behind it, too.

### **Voice Development**

We knew the brand had to sound like Ashton, but also tell a bigger story. So we built a messaging framework that spoke to fans on three levels:

*   *   **External**: “I want supplements that actually work.”
*   **Internal**: “I want to feel confident in what I’m putting in my body.”
*   **Philosophical**: “I deserve a brand that’s as committed to results as I am.”

Every word, from the tagline to the product descriptions was crafted to **b**uild trust while igniting aspiration.

## **Packaging & Label Design: Strategy in Action**

Once the brandscape and brandscript were finalized, they became the foundation for everything, including packaging and label design. These strategic tools defined how the brand should look, sound, and feel, and that direction carried seamlessly into every creative asset we developed.

For the labels, our goal was simple: translate the brand strategy into shelf power.

*   The visual identity we established in the brandscape informed the color palette, typography, and overall aesthetic.

*   The voice we defined in the brandscript shaped the messaging hierarchy, from front-of-pack callouts to subtle trust builders like GMP certifications and “Made in the USA.”

*   Every element was designed to connect instantly with Ashton’s audience while standing out in a highly competitive Amazon marketplace.

This wasn’t just about making labels look good — it was about ensuring that every touchpoint, from packaging to ads to Amazon listings, told the same cohesive story and built trust from the very first glance.

## **Launch Strategy: Leveraging Influence + Amazon Power**

Most influencers push traffic to their own websites when launching products. But with Ashton’s massive audience and our deep experience launching supplement brands, we knew there was a smarter play: Amazon first.

Why? Amazon’s algorithm rewards demand. When a surge of buyers actively seeks out your product on Amazon, the platform responds by boosting organic rankings, visibility, and sales velocity. The higher your momentum, the more Amazon pushes your product to new customers you’d never reach on your own.

We built a launch strategy designed to maximize that effect. The specific sales numbers from this launch are confidential, but we can share this: Worthy Supps generated tens of thousands of dollars in revenue within the first 30 days and secured a strong foothold in one of Amazon’s most competitive supplement categories.

*   Drove tens of thousands of clicks to Amazon in the first 30 days via Ashton’s audience and targeted ads.
*   Achieved 111 organic keyword rankings on page one within the first month, putting Worthy Supps directly in front of high-intent buyers.
*   Hit a Best Seller Rank (BSR) of 39,000 in the Health & Personal Care category, one of the most competitive spaces on Amazon.

**And here’s the key:** lower BSR = better performance. To put this into perspective, a BSR of 150K or better within the first 30 days is considered a very strong launch in this category. Worthy Supps didn’t just hit that benchmark, it obliterated it.

**This Amazon-first strategy allowed us to do two things simultaneously:
**

1.  1.  1.  **Monetize Ashton’s existing audience immediately
**
2.  **Capture new buyers organically who had never heard of him before**

The result? Ashton’s influence launched the brand, but Amazon’s algorithm amplified it, unlocking compounding growth beyond his social reach.

### If you’re a Fitness influencer ready to monetize your audience with a supplement brand you can stand behind, and you want to launch it the right way, let’s talk.
