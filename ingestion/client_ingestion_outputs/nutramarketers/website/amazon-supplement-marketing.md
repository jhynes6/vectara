# Amazon Services for Supplement Brands

You don’t just need an Amazon expert. You need a supplement expert who understands Amazon.

## Your Expert Partner in Selling Supplements on Amazon

Selling supplements on Amazon is no walk in the park. With some of the strictest regulations in all of eCommerce, it’s a high-risk, high-reward environment. From warning letters to de-listings and even permanent account bans, the stakes are serious. At NutraMarketers, we know Amazon’s regulatory landscape inside and out. That means we don’t just help our clients sell, we help them stay safe and scale.

## **How We Get You Ranked and Selling**

#### **Search-Optimized Listings**

Amazon is a search engine. Your listing needs to speak the language of both the algorithm **and** the customer. We combine deep keyword research with high-converting copy and beautiful, conversion-focused creative.

#### **PPC and Off-Amazon Traffic**

We use Amazon Sponsored Ads to generate quick traction, then layer in off-Amazon traffic like Google PPC and social media Ads to drive external sales, a powerful ranking signal in Amazon’s A10 algorithm.

#### **Algorithm Leverage: The A10 Advantage**

What matters most now:

*   **Sales History** – Consistent sales build trust with the algorithm.
*   **Organic Sales** – Sales from organic searches drive higher rankings.
*   **CTR & Conversion Rate** – Better clicks and purchases signal relevance.
*   **Inventory** – Stockouts suppress rankings; full stock boosts visibility.
*   **Off-Site Sales** – External traffic improves rankings and review velocity.

**Internal Sales** – Bought via “Frequently Bought Together”

#### **Review Strategy**

Social proof is currency. We help you:

*   Leverage Amazon’s Vine Voice Program
*   Monitor and dispute unfair reviews
*   Generate reviews through compliant strategies

#### **Account Health Monitoring**

We proactively monitor your AHR (Account Health Rating) and compliance metrics to prevent suspensions or deactivations before they happen.

## **Creative That Converts**

#### Award Winning Video Production

#### Amazon-compliant Graphics and EBC

#### Conversion-focused Product Images

We make your listing look better than your competitors, and sell better too.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

##### How long does it take to launch a supplement on Amazon?

Most brands can launch within 4-6 weeks depending on readiness. We handle everything from listing setup to account verification.

##### Is Amazon a good platform for new supplement brands?

Yes, but only if you do it right. Amazon is one of the most powerful sales channels, but it’s highly competitive and heavily regulated. We ensure you’re compliant and positioned to grow.

##### What does NutraMarketers do differently?

We specialize in supplements, not general eCommerce. Our expertise in Amazon’s compliance, marketing strategy, and creative execution gives our clients a clear edge.

##### Can I sell a supplement without reviews?

Yes, but reviews are critical for growth. We help you generate your first reviews quickly and compliantly using Amazon-approved methods like Vine Voice.

##### What if my Amazon account gets flagged or suspended?

We offer proactive Account Health Monitoring and handle escalations fast to keep your business running.

##### Do you handle inventory and logistics?

We help forecast and manage inventory inside Amazon Seller Central. While we don’t fulfill orders ourselves, we work with your logistics team or 3PL to keep stock levels healthy.

##### How much does it cost to work with NutraMarketers?

We offer custom programs tailored to your brand’s goals. Pricing depends on the scope and can be discussed during your free consultation.
