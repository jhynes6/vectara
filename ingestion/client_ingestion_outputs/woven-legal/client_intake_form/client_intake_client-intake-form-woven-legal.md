Campaign Criteria

Targeting

Describe your top three target personas (clients): 
 Small law firm (under 5 attorneys) owners and/or the Firm Manager within the following practice areas: Estate Planning & Probate, Business Contracts law, Family law, Litigation. (maybe immigration) 
 HC 1-20
 Are there industries you won’t sell to? Louisiana is a hard state to secure business because their laws are based on the French judicial system and paras outside of LA can’t adapt quickly enough. Personal injury is not a favorite either but Insurance Defense is. Insurance defense firms work on behalf of the insurance companies who have insured the company/organization being sued. Criminal firms have a hard time making any money so I rarely call on them, either.
 (ex. Health Care, Law Firms, Franchises)

Offerings

What services do you sell to your top 3 target personas? (ex. PPC, Social Content, Email Marketing) 
 We sell fractional law firm support staffing services (usually paralegals) on a subscription basis.
 We sell on-demand, project based paralegal and admin support for times when a firm is waiting for a new hire to begin, have too much work for current staff but can’t afford to hire another person yet, have project based work (research, creating or improving templates or processes used in the firm or drafting documents, for ex.).
 For each service, what are your top offers (packages/examples) that you would be willing to pitch them?
 Our Designated Placement Svcs (DPS) are available for 40 hrs/mo, 60, 80, 120 and 160 hrs/mo. PDC projects - the client doesn’t pay until they approve the work.
 We offer increased productivity in as little as ~ 2 weeks (with our subscription svc), fewer headaches and more time to focus on serving more clients and growing revenue. 

Cost of Services

What is your average order value? What are your “Starting At” costs for your services?
 Our svcs are the following: $47/hr for VA, $56/hr for Legal Asst, $62/hr. for Paralegal. $2480 is our most common package (40 hrs/mo @ $62/hour = $2480); Our svcs for the PDC are: $47/hr. for VA, $61/hr & $68/hr for paralegal. Since the PDC is on-demand - jobs can range from $47 - $15,000.

Service Differentiation

What makes you different from your competitors? What is your “special sauce”?
 Our Productivity Center sets us apart from all other staffing companies because we use a team-based approach. For example, a team of experienced paralegals tackle clients’ projects and QC the work 2 more times before it’s provided to client for their approval. It’s fast, easy & accurate.
 Also, with our DPS line, every engagement comes with a relationship mgr and all of our RM’s are also very experienced paralegals.

Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? What do you do to improve their business?
 I need to delegate more work to be successful and grow my firm but it’s so hard to delegate with trust because I’ve been burned so many times - it’s just easier to do it myself. I can’t afford to hire full time so I’ve been using (an old para, their neighbor’s daughter with 3 kids, etc.) and it’s just not working - they’re not reliable/dependable.  
 Solution: We specialize in helping law firms scale efficiently with paralegals and productivity solutions so you can focus and grow your business. 

Case Studies and Previous Customer Successes

For each service, what are case studies or recent customer successes that you use to highlight your expertise in your field?
 (ex: generated 50k in net new sales in 30 days for a service business with a seasonal email marketing campaign)
 (ex: generated 120k in net new revenue with a GenZ-focused organic TikTok Campaign) 
 (ex: increased CTR by 240% and sign ups by 318% with Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo Campaign)
 After 6 weeks with my paralegal, my billable time increased by about an hour/day or ~ 33%. I’ve now had my WL paralegal for almost 6 months and my billable time is up another 30%! 
 I no longer have to worry about payroll, insurance, technology and all the things that come with hiring. Woven Legal handles all of that now which allows me to lead our team and grow this firm.
 I don’t wake up at night anymore panicked I will miss a court deadline or allow a client to slip through the cracks.
 I thought I could hire the right paralegal on my own but I wasted time and money choosing people who caused drama, lacked experience and initiative. With WL, I know I will get a qualified person and if I have any problems, I have a team of people to call. And, they answer their phones! 
 My wife and I went on our first real vacation together in 5 years because the 2 paralegals I got from WL kept my practice running smoothly until I got back. I wish I had hired them sooner.
