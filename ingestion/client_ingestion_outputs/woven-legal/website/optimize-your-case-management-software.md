## _**Tips on Case Management Optimization for Small Law Firms**  _

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing it wrong!‚Äù  
‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre doing it wrong.‚Äù

I overheard this exchange between two attorneys at a law firm. One was frustrated by his colleague‚Äôs DIY workarounds in their case management system (CMS), while the other admitted he didn‚Äôt know how to get the software to do what he needed in the first place. Both were clearly trying‚Äîbut hitting walls instead of streamlining workflows.

## Let‚Äôs Get Honest About Your Case Management System

You likely invested in a platform like [Clio](https://www.clio.com/web/woven-clio-demo/?referral_code=AP-WOVEN), [MyCase](https://www.mycase.com/), or [PracticePanther](https://www.practicepanther.com/), or one of the other numerous systems to bring order to your operations. But here‚Äôs the uncomfortable truth: most small firms aren‚Äôt using their CMS effectively.

And this isn‚Äôt just anecdotal.

üìä According to the [2023 ABA TechReport](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/law_practice/publications/techreport/2023/practice-management/), while 59% of solo and small firm attorneys report access to a CMS, only 47% in firms with 2‚Äì9 attorneys actively use it. That means more than half of small firms may be paying for tools they aren‚Äôt fully leveraging‚Äîa costly oversight.

## The Real Cost of Underutilization

Even if you‚Äôre not logging in daily, your CMS affects how quickly matters progress, how accurately time is tracked, when invoices go out, and ultimately, how fast you get paid.

Managing attorneys often tell us that billing feels like pulling concrete uphill. It can take nearly a full day each month to cobble together time entries and build invoices‚Äîtime that could be spent on client work or business development.

When used correctly, your CMS should streamline billing‚Äînot add to the burden.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls of Underused CMS Tools

*   Relying on spreadsheets or sticky notes  
*   Ignoring built-in automation features  
*   Manually creating documents instead of using templates  
*   Inconsistent team usage due to lack of training  
*   No custom reporting to track progress or profitability  

## Why This Happens

1. No strategy behind the setup  
Many firms install the software but never fully configure it, leading to broken processes and inefficient workarounds.

2. Assuming the team is using it properly  
Without standard operating procedures and training, most staff revert to old habits‚Äîor use the CMS only partially.

3. Workarounds instead of workflows  
When the system isn‚Äôt aligned with how your firm actually works, teams create patchwork fixes that compound the problem.

## What ‚ÄúDoing It Right‚Äù Looks Like

Firms that get this right don‚Äôt just use their CMS‚Äî[they leverage it](https://wovenlegal.com/is-your-law-firm-keeping-up-in-the-digital-age/). They build workflows, adopt automation, create templates, and train their teams to rely on the platform daily‚Äînot as an afterthought.

We‚Äôve seen small firms make major improvements by:

*   Creating templates for intake, document generation, and tasks  
*   Mapping workflows by practice area  
*   Tracking time entries in real time  
*   Syncing with tools like QuickBooks, DocuSign, and Outlook  
*   Using dashboards to monitor productivity and collections  
*   Automating client communication follow-ups

These optimizations can be done in-house, with a consultant, or with support from service providers. If you‚Äôre looking for help, [Woven Legal](https://wovenlegal.com/) is one such resource.

Improving CMS usage affects more than convenience‚Äîit [drives revenue](https://wovenlegal.com/billing-strategies-for-attorneys/):

*   Matters move forward without bottlenecks  
*   Time entries are captured and billed promptly  
*   Invoices go out faster  
*   Payments arrive sooner  
*   Staff work more efficiently  

In short, it shortens the cash conversion cycle‚Äîhelping you get paid faster for work you‚Äôre already doing.

## Final Word: Fix the Software, Free the Firm

Your CMS likely isn‚Äôt broken‚Äîit‚Äôs just underutilized. Whether you improve it yourself, bring in a trainer, or partner with someone like us, the point is to act. The payoff is real.
