_A Simple Guide for Small Law Firms to Stay Safe_

Your small law firm is likely a treasure trove for bad actors and is likely chock-full of sensitive data— private client details, legal plans, financial info, and more. To someone with bad intentions, your systems can look as inviting as [a purse stuffed with $3,000, a passport, and apartment keys!](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/27/suspect-arrested-theft-kristi-noem-purse/83313347007/) That’s why hackers target law firms, no matter their size. They don’t care if you’re prepping for trial or juggling a dozen client calls — they’re just after the data.

The good news? You don’t have to be a tech expert to stay protected. Cybersecurity is a lot like locking your office — it just takes the right tools and a few smart habits to achieve some peace of mind. At Woven Legal, all of our virtual paralegals receive ongoing education on cybersecurity protocols and expectations. When things get more complex, we turn to experts like [Daniel Shaffer from Best Fit IT](https://www.bestfitit.com/).

Keep reading to understand why cybersecurity can no longer be ignored, the threats your firm faces, and the practical steps you can take to protect it. And, we’ve included tips from Daniel to help you take action, not just take notes.

## **Why Law Firms Are Targets (Real Examples)**

Cyberattacks on law firms are becoming more common. Here are four real breaches from 2024–2025 that show what’s at stake:

* **Wolf Haldenstein LLP**: [Hackers exposed personal info of 3.5 million people. _Why?_ Weak passwords left the door open.](https://www.hipaajournal.com/wolf-haldenstein-data-breach/)
* **Thompson Coburn LLP**: [Stolen healthcare records led to lawsuits. _Why?_ Someone clicked a bad link.](https://chimicles.com/thompson-coburn-data-breach/)
* **Shook Lin & Bok** (Singapore): [Ransomware locked their files until they paid $1.4 mm. Why? No backups meant no other options.](https://www.suspectfile.com/exclusive-singapore-shook-lin-bok-law-firm-pays-a-ransom-of-1-4m-to-the-akira-ransomware-group/)
* **Gunster Law**: [A breach cost them $8.5 million to settle. _Why?_ They didn’t spot weak spots in time.](https://www.msba.org/site/site/content/News-and-Publications/News/General-News/Law_Firm_Settles_Data_Breach_Lawsuit_A_Warning_for_Legal_Professionals.aspx)

_“Hackers love law firms because they hold valuable data, and attorneys are often too busy to notice a sneaky email. One mistake can cause big problems,” says Daniel Shaffer._

These examples prove that **any firm can be hit,** and the result could be costly enough to sink a small firm. The key is to act before you hit a hacker’s radar or fall victim to a targeted attack.

## **How AI Makes Things Trickier**

AI tools like ChatGPT can be great for drafting emails or notes, but hackers are using AI, too. Here’s how AI raises the stakes:

* **Fake Emails (Phishing)**: AI helps bad actors, too! Hackers have created emails that look like they’re from a client or judge, tricking you into clicking a bad link or sharing a password. For example, you might see, “Urgent: Sign this document,” but it’s a trap.
* **Data Risks**: Typing client info into an unsecured AI tool could let that data leak or be stored unsafely.
* **Client Trust**: A 2025 survey shows 81% of clients worry about AI in their legal work. Nearly half would leave a firm after a breach.

_“AI is like a sharp knife—it’s useful but dangerous if you’re not careful. Always double-check emails and avoid sharing sensitive info with AI tools,” says Daniel Shaffer._

## **5 Easy Ways to Protect Your Firm**

Cybersecurity doesn’t have to be complicated. Think of it like keeping your office safe: a few good habits go a long way. Here are five steps any small law firm can take:

### **1. Use Strong Passwords and Extra Locks**

Make passwords **long, random, and unique** for every account. Think of a password as a secret code that’s impossible to crack. Add **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**, which is like a second key—it requires a code from your phone to log in, even if someone has your password.  

### **2. Work in Safe Software**

Use secure platforms designed for law firms, like:

* **Clio** for case management
* **NetDocuments** for file sharing

These tools protect your data. At Woven Legal, we train our paralegals to use them safely, following best practices from experts like Daniel.

### **3. Train Everyone to Spot Scams**

Fake emails (phishing) are the top way hackers get in. Programs like **KnowBe4** teach your team to spot tricks, like emails asking for urgent logins. We use KnowBe4 for our staff and ask Daniel for guidance to get it right.

_“Training isn’t about being perfect—it’s about slowing down to check before you click. Firms should train everyone, including contractors,” says Daniel Shaffer._

### **4. Get Expert Checkups**

A **cybersecurity audit** is like a home inspection—it finds weak spots before trouble starts. Experts like Daniel at Best Fit IT can review your systems and suggest simple fixes.

“_A cybersecurity checkup is quick and can save you from a disaster. Don’t wait until it’s too late,” says Daniel._ 

### **5. Back Up Your Files**

We have all known for years the importance of making copies of your files in a secure cloud service or external drive. However, too often it’s still overlooked or put off. If ransomware locks your data, backups let you recover without paying hackers.

## **Why Experts Make the Difference**

At Woven Legal, we’re not the cybersecurity experts, but when a client entrusts us with their systems and data, we treat it with the utmost care. That’s why we provide ongoing support to our virtual paralegals and legal assistants in **cybersecurity best practices** using tools like KnowBe4 and platforms like Clio and NetDocuments. When we have questions, we turn to experts like Daniel Shaffer to guide us.

Our most successful clients – law firms that are proactive or those that have been burned by attacks or scams- tell us they follow the same approach: focus on foundational protections and consult cybersecurity professionals for protocols, audits, and anything more complex. These prudent steps could keep your firm safe without overwhelming your team. When you need to delegate, choosing partners like Woven Legal—who prioritize secure workflows—gives you peace of mind.

## **Quick Questions to Check Your Safety**

Take a minute to ask these yes/no questions:

1.  Do we rely on a tech stack made up of secure tools? Do the vendor agreements make clear what happens in the event of a breach caused by their platform?
2.  Are our passwords strong and protected with MFA and stored in a secure location/software?
3.  Has our team been trained to spot phishing emails? Just once, or is it ongoing?
4.  Do our contractors follow cybersecurity best practices? If so, are your expectations written down and shared with your team?
5.  Have we had a cybersecurity audit in the last year? If so, did we fix any issues it pointed out?

If you answered “no” to any, it’s time to make a plan.
