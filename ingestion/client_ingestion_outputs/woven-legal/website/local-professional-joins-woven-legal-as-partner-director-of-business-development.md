FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

_Rapidly growing legal staffing and consulting company, Woven Legal, LLC, welcomes Meg Garavaglia as Partner and Director of Business Development._

**Atlanta, GA, December 7, 2020 –** Woven Legal is a solutions-based company born out of a growing need by attorneys to have a business expert familiar with law on their side. Woven Legal provides services that help manage the processes, technology, and people that make a law firm grow. Garavaglia joins Caroline Chambers in continuing to grow this dynamic company.

Garavaglia brings nearly 15 years of experience promoting attorneys and law firms – specifically in the areas of litigation support and e-Discovery services, staffing solutions, brand awareness, and creative marketing strategies to help drive growth for law firms’ market share. Relationship selling, particularly an authentic approach to seizing opportunities and addressing challenges, has earned her numerous awards throughout her career. She looks forward to continuing to serve attorneys and share her expertise with the clients at Woven Legal.

“Meg’s substantial experience and sustained success working with attorneys bring a new perspective to Woven Legal as we expand across the Atlanta area and nationwide,” said Woven Legal’s managing partner and experienced business attorney, Caroline Chambers. “As we continue to focus on growth and expansion, having strong and experienced leadership will help us continue to drive the company towards lasting customer relationships – supporting and leading a growing roster of attorneys and firms.”

“I am excited to contribute to this new role by applying the knowledge and experience my mentors and managers have invested in me to lead Woven Legal’s business development efforts. [Woven Legal] has carved out an impressive niche by employing **Firm Diagnostics,** which we see as the first step in reducing staff turnover and our clients’ churn. We truly want to help our clients have the bandwidth necessary to focus on THEIR roles by trusting us to do what we are great at – placing virtual legal professionals, streamlining processes, and addressing bottlenecks with candor. We know all of this amounts to a recipe for significant revenue growth,” shared Garavaglia. “Caroline and I make a great team by approaching business from different vantage points.

But most importantly, we are united in the vision: helping clients focus their intellectual capital where it is most valuable.”

In addition to overseeing sales and marketing, Garavaglia will also focus on CLE development, client networking, and coaching.

“I hope we can continually expand the overall capabilities of our organization while hiring and contracting with experienced virtual legal professionals who share our passion for helping attorneys grow and run their firms,” Garavaglia commented.

Outside of work, Meg enjoys hiking local trails, kayaking in Lake Allatoona, and sharing family time with her two young adult boys and her husband, Chris.
