# Why Most Law Firms Are Hiring Marketing Services

by [Patti Cotter](https://wovenlegal.com/author/patti-cotter/)

Gone are the days in which an attorney’s expertise, case results, and practice history were enough to maintain a steady stream of new clients. Today, the vast majority of would-be clients use the Internet to look for an attorney. Thus, you’re losing out on potential clients if you aren’t marketing your firm properly.

Fortunately, help is available. Online marketing services — including those designed specifically to serve law firms — take the burden of marketing your firm off your shoulders.

## How Professional Marketing Supports Your Firm

Ultimately, professional marketing services are meant to serve two main purposes. They should increase your client base while simultaneously outsourcing the considerable workload that comes with marketing.

Large law firms may have entire marketing departments composed of a team of professional writers, graphic designers, social media managers, and other marketing specialists. For [smaller firms](https://wovenlegal.com/marketing-for-law-firms/), competing with an entire department’s marketing strategies can sound daunting and financially prohibitive.

Professional marketing services exist as a solution to this dilemma. An attorney can outsource their marketing campaign to a team of professionals who work for the marketing services firm. They can also choose the strategies, services, and pricing that align with their budget and goals.

## Why More Attorneys Are Choosing Marketing Services

Marketing a law firm in the digital age means having nearly endless potential for [attracting new clients](https://wovenlegal.com/attracting-new-clients/). At the same time, the thought of where to begin can feel overwhelming.

Tried-and-true advertising methods like billboards, print ads, and radio advertisements are still effective ways to attract clients. But it’s also essential to give considerable weight to your firm’s online presence. Unfortunately, navigating the world of online marketing tends to grow more complicated the more you look into it.

When you start researching how to market your firm online, you’ll likely be quickly inundated with advice: search engine optimization, location-based advertising, and technical tools to monitor whether your message reaches potential clients and leads to client retention.

If you’re an attorney, you’ve spent years earning your law degree and building your practice. You likely have neither the time nor the inclination to dedicate countless hours to learning how to be a digital marketing professional.

Fortunately, legal digital marketing services work with you to identify your needs and execute the marketing strategies that will most efficiently help you meet your goals. And they do so without costing you extra time, money, and clients in the meantime.

## The Most Popular Marketing Services for Attorneys

Digital marketing takes many forms. However, there’s no doubt that having a robust online presence is essential for reaching clients who are trying to find an attorney on the Internet.

When you work with a digit marketing service, they’ll meet with you to discuss your goals and recommend strategies to help build your clientele. Below, you’ll find some of the most popular and effective strategies for making your firm stand out among the online crowd.

### Blogs

These days, it seems like everyone has a blog, and there’s a good reason for that. Blogs are among the most powerful online tools for leading new clients to your firm.

Law firm blogs are among the leading sources of free legal information available online. When a potential client ends up in legal trouble, one of the first steps they take is to use the Internet to learn more about their situation and the possible consequences and courses of action.

You want your firm’s blog to give potential new clients the information they’re looking for before urging them to schedule a consultation to learn more about how you can help with their legal predicament.

Blogs help advertise your firm while offering potential clients the support they need. They’re also highly effective at getting new clients in the door for a consultation.

### SEO

If you’ve researched how to better market yourself as an attorney, you’ve undoubtedly seen the term “[search engine optimization](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/seo-starter-guide)” or SEO. SEO is about having the right keywords strategically embedded in your online content. Search engines like Google use keywords to produce results when a potential client is looking for an attorney online.

Search engine optimization is a large part of what determines whether your website appears on page one or page 50 of a web search. A potential client will probably not search through 50 pages of law firms before selecting yours.

This is why hiring digital marketing professionals to improve your site’s SEO can be so effective. It leads to the visibility you need when potential new clients are seeking a lawyer online.

### Social Media

You can’t underestimate the power of social media to make or break your chance of attracting new clients. Indeed, your online presence provides the first impression that a potential client has of you and your legal services.

A poor first impression tends to have negative consequences. It means you’ve achieved the more challenging task of getting your firm’s name in front of a potential client only to lose their attention because you failed to impress them.

An attorney’s online presence encompasses far more than a website alone. It’s crucial to put just as much care into your firm’s page on [Google Business](https://www.google.com/business/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/), and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/).

You don’t know which platform a new client will look at to learn more about your firm. Thus, if you have an online account, you need to make sure it’s updated and compelling.

## Getting Started with Attorney Marketing

If you’re ready to get serious about marketing your firm, you need a plan of action. You’ll have to identify how much you’re willing to spend on marketing and have some idea of the goal you’re hoping to reach.

Planning for success with an online legal marketing service involves:

* Creating a marketing budget
* Identifying your marketing goals
* Getting quotes from marketing services
* Choosing the right legal marketing provider

When you know what you want, you’re better able to identify which marketing service will help you meet your marketing goals for your law firm.
