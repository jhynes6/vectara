# Why “Assuming” in Business Conversations Can Be Costly

It’s common for people to jokingly ask, “Do you know why you shouldn’t assume?” That aside, the danger of unspoken assumptions in professional discussions, especially in the context of delegation, cannot be ignored.

Such assumptions can lead to misunderstandings and incorrectly executed tasks, leading to frustration and feelings of being undermined. If you often find the delegated work not meeting expectations or have received feedback about your delegation skills, consider the following misconceptions:

#### **Misconception #1:** 
Thinking, “I did it in 15 minutes; why did the new paralegal take 90 minutes?”

* Remember, newcomers need time to familiarize themselves. They might be taking longer to ensure accuracy. With experience, they will likely become more efficient.

#### **Misconception #2:** 
Feeling, “I’ve told my paralegal twice, but they still don’t get it.”

* Everyone has a unique learning curve. A person’s educational background doesn’t always equate to their ability to grasp specific tasks quickly. Patience and understanding can foster a better working relationship.

#### **Misconception #3:** 
Thinking, “I don’t need our 1:1 meetings, so I’ll focus on other tasks.”

* Prioritizing regular communication fosters trust. By valuing their input, you enhance job satisfaction and retention.

#### **Misconception #4:** 
Believing you must address every query immediately.

* Encourage newcomers to consolidate questions, allowing you to answer them at a dedicated time, reducing constant interruptions.

#### **Misconception #5:** 
Thinking, “Of course, we all have the same priorities!”

* Everyone has a unique perspective. Clear communication about what matters most to you can prevent misalignment.

#### **Misconception #6:** 
Assuming, “If there’s no feedback, everything’s fine.”

* Constructive feedback is essential. Encouraging a dialogue, especially during learning phases, is invaluable.

#### **Misconception #7:** 
Deciding, “I’ll handle this; my paralegal wouldn’t like it.”

* Remember, the support staff is there to assist. Ensure clear communication about task preferences and continue to delegate as trust grows.

#### **Misconception #8:** 
Believing, “They’ll understand my usual terms.”

* Familiar terms to you might be alien to a newcomer. Ensuring clarity in communication prevents potential misinterpretations.

#### **Misconception #9:** 
Delegating solely based on tasks without considering the bigger picture.

* Educate your team about the broader goals. Connecting individual tasks to the end game provides perspective and purpose.

With these insights, you can build a productive workspace with a cohesive team, fostering growth and success!
