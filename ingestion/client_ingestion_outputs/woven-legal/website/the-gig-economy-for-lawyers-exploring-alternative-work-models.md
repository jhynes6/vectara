The “gig” work model has taken off across a variety of fields, from rideshare drivers to the freelancers you can hire to design your website. The [gig economy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gig-economy.asp) is based on flexible and temporary positions that work outside of the traditional, standard, and long-term employer-employee relationship.  

As a legal professional, you have probably not considered this option. The traditional work model is so deeply entrenched that it can seem impossible to shift away from it. However, many legal professionals opt for the flexibility of the gig economy. But why has it become so popular?

## **Why the Shift From Traditional Work Models Is Necessary**

One of the main reasons the legal profession is shifting from the traditional work model is that the old way of doing things is just not working for clients any longer. Clients increasingly expect faster delivery of legal services as well as flexibility and more affordable rates.  

The traditional law firm carries significant overhead costs and tends to have an inflexible system that can slow the process of getting clients what they need. In other words, it provides the opposite of what clients want.  

Combined with client dissatisfaction is the desire of legal professionals themselves to have more control over how they work. The newer generations want a more flexible work environment that allows them to focus less on billable hours and more on living a life outside of the office.  

There’s also a less clear path to reaching the top of the profession — the security that a traditional job at a law firm used to offer isn’t a given any longer. The traditional partnership-based model is also limiting to the younger generations.  

These models thrive on having legal associates who get paid only a fraction of the revenue they generate while being forbidden to work at other firms. Even if they do rise in ranks, the younger lawyers have no independence when deciding on the structures through which to deliver legal services. These decisions are left to senior partners.  

It’s not difficult to understand why legal professionals want to break away from this well-worn model and try something new. That’s where the gig economy comes in.  

## **Key Features of the Gig Economy**

The gig has some significant key features that make it stand out for people in the legal field. Here’s a look at some of the most important ones.  

### **Flexible and Independent Work Arrangements**

The main feature of the gig economy is the flexibility it offers. You have the chance to choose where and when you work as well as how much you charge for your services. It can be an essential feature for those looking to find the work-life balance that can be so elusive when dealing with the traditional law firm model.  

### **Project-Based Positions**

Instead of working for one law firm for years, you can choose short-term and project-based positions. You can also get exposure to different tasks and build a diverse resume.  

### **Digital Platforms**

The gig economy has surged thanks to the digital platforms that make it easier for legal professionals to find “gigs” as well as for employers to get access to a wide pool of talent. Digital platforms allow you to grow your reputation with reviews and showcase your experience.  

### **Pricing Flexibility**

One of the most serious concerns people have with relying on law firms is the inflexible payment structure. When you are able to set your own pricing, you can help your clientele pool expand while ensuring that people receive the assistance they need.  

## **Benefits of the Gig Economy for Law Professionals**  

The gig economy offers a wealth of benefits for law professionals.  

### **Take Control Over Your Work**

Crucially, the gig economy gives you more control over your work schedule. You aren’t tied to a firm that requires long hours, and you can take the positions you want when you want to. For people who want to start a family or just improve their quality of life with more manageable work hours, the gig economy can be essential.  

### **Boost Your Entrepreneurial Spirit**

The gig economy transforms you into your own boss. That encourages entrepreneurial spirit, allowing you to market yourself as you want and build the exact brand you want people to associate with your services.  

### **Build Diverse Skill Sets**

You also have the chance to build up a diverse skill set. You can cast a wide net of positions and then zero in on what you want to focus on. By being exposed to a variety of clients and situations, you can also build adaptability.  

### **Benefit From Global Opportunities**

You also have access to global opportunities. With constantly advancing technology, you can reach a whole world of clients. No matter your physical location, you can participate in projects wherever you please.  

## **Challenges of the Gig Economy for Law Professionals**

As with anything, there are some challenges to consider before settling into the gig economy.  

### **Job Insecurity**

Working at a law firm offers more stability than taking on freelance positions. With the gig economy, you can face lots of competition for postings, and that can be stressful for many.  

### **Lack of Benefits**

Another challenge to consider is that you don’t necessarily get health or retirement benefits in the gig economy model. If you’re focused on long-term planning, you can struggle to have a clear idea of what your future will look like.  

### **Financial Instability**

Projects can ebb, and then what happens? This kind of income instability can pose challenges for those who are looking to save up for a home, for example. You also face the challenges of having to market yourself to get new projects, and this can put an additional strain on your finances.
