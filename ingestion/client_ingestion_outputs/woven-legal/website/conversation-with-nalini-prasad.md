# Conversation with Nalini Prasad

![](https://wovenlegal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/nalini-transparent.png)

by [Woven Legal](https://wovenlegal.com/author/wovenlegal_iw3gt6/)

on [August 13, 2021](https://wovenlegal.com/2021/08/13/)

Nalini Prasad is the Chief Strategy Officer of BluShark Digital. Originally with the Price Benowitz law firm, she was a part of the in-house marketing team for the DC, Maryland, and Virginia areas. Once Price Benowitz began to grow, they decided, “If we can do this for us, we can probably do this for firms across the country.” That’s when they took the 10-person in-house marketing team and turned it into [Blushark Digital](https://blusharkdigital.com/).

What makes them a little bit different, too, is that their founder, Seth Price, is a JD. He deals with the same issues that many of their clients deal with. They focus on looking for cost-effective, high-impact marketing strategies to help their law firm clients perform well in their chosen marketing strategies.

Largely, we focus on the four channels Google looks at when determining search rankings. Those four categories are:

*   Technical content
*   Link building
*   Local
*   SEO

Across these four buckets, Google wants to see that you are a little bit better than (the competition) ranking in your city right now. We, at BluShark Digital, focused on those four specific items, structured our company in the same way, and created (corresponding) departments. We are now at about 55 individuals at BluShark Digital. I have the role of coming up with strategies and new ways to work with what Google is doing.

**MG: So you’re always having to adapt and come up with new strategies**?

**NP:** Approximately every six months Google releases a new update. They are teaching their algorithm to be more sophisticated and at BluShark Digital we know what we need to do to continue to stay in Googles’ good graces and to make sure that our clients’ websites are doing well.

We sprinkle that knowledge not only throughout the company but across the country by educating lawyers on how to do it themselves. We explain to them, “Here is what SEO is.” There is no secret sauce. It is, “effort in, effort out.” In 2019 I spoke at 30 legal conferences. Years ago, I fell in love with what we do. And, I obviously do love sharing the knowledge –  to justify being on the road that much. I enjoy teaching and everything that happens with those four little buckets.

**MG: That is so impressive – your deep understanding of all things Google. To fully understand the rules and the constraints, it would take too much time. And, their rules are always changing!**

**NP:** Yes! Google is constantly learning. It is an AI system and it’s constantly updating its ability to provide the best result for a searcher. Google also formulates its search results using those four categories. So, even when there are updates, these fundamental items are what have always remained the same throughout the last 10-15 years of updates. Google is getting better with every update. But, at the end of the day, websites must make sure that their coding speaks to the bot so that Google knows what’s on your website. And, Google gives webmasters the proper coding. Google has a whole dictionary that says – if you have a video on this page, here’s the code you copy/paste onto the back end to show Google’s bot that this is a video.

The key is using Google’s code, then adding expert, sophisticated content, written as a real authority on the information you are sharing. For now, Google says you can’t include certain aspects and it wants to see longer website pages now. But as long as you are adding sophisticated, real, expert authoritative information, you’re going to be fine.

Link-building is endorsements from other websites. In the past, you paid for a link somewhere and you got these endorsements. Google’s getting smarter and now it’s recognizing those paid links are generally very spammy links.  If you are getting real organizations that you have real relationships with to endorse you online, you are fine. When you look at these different categories like Google Local, Google My Business, and your Google reviews, and you continue to do the right thing with great content and real links, you are going in the right direction even with all the updates.

**MG: I’m sure you are aware of the debate over which is the most important approach: an attorney’s personal brand development vs. a firm’s brand development. The topic of personal branding seems to pick up speed amongst attorneys for a while then takes a backseat again to firm branding. Do you think one is more important than the other and what thoughts do you have re: when a law firm feels threatened if/when their attorneys build their own personal brand (which would hypothetically accompany that attorney should they leave the firm)?**

**NP:** I love this question because I think that this goes beyond digital. This is about operations. This is about building your business and the way I look at this is a team effort. “You are only as strong as your weakest link,” is what we’ve always heard. But similarly, the stronger your pieces are the stronger your whole entity is going to be.

Oftentimes, we see that firms that have the most revenue or that have rapidly increased in revenue often have lawyers who are rainmakers. They are allowing their lawyers to become stronger. The leadership is teaching those lawyers how to be better and pouring resources and training into them. If you are scared that your attorneys will develop a great brand of their own which gets them noticed – but that they will then take their brand with them should they leave, so you discourage it – you leave a lot of money on the table for your own firm. When those leaders choose to not train those folks on marketing themselves and building their brand, they aren’t leveraging the awesome talent that is right NOW under the firm’s name. Those attorneys are not out building their brand for the purpose of having their own firm!

Unfortunately, firms that are scared of losing their top talent are shooting themselves in the foot by not taking _advantage_ of marketing their attorneys’ talent. Quite honestly, I would say that the firms that are going to grow are the firms whose strategies properly leverage their talent.

My advice is that you market your talent. For example, if you identify someone who can help your firm take it to the next revenue level, you should put time and effort into promoting them. Show trust and give them the freedom to develop their brand. At the same time, when you are branding them, you are branding them intertwined with you and your firm.

So there are guidelines. If I’m going to give you all of these resources – and we can say this with BluShark – Seth has helped me put myself on so many stages. And he has helped me to help BluShark! I was someone here who wanted to speak at places, who had the technical knowledge, and Seth has opened all the doors for me. But when I get up there I am ‘Nalini BluShark.’ I am here and I love this company. It makes sure that you are building the company brand alongside your own brand. Now ‘Nalini’ gets asked to speak at many lawyers’ conferences and events. But there is absolutely BluShark behind me when I’m speaking on that stage. When you build your people’s brands, it’s really important to make sure that your logo is always present as well.

It is also important that you maintain a very good relationship with your rainmakers. If they need something, if they are asking for something reasonable then consider answering, “yes!” You take care of your all-stars. I think a lot of the firms that I’ve seen master this, who do well don’t lose their A-plus stars, are the firms who make sure to continue to build that rapport and that relationship.

One thing I will say from a digital standpoint is if a lawyer is niche, such as a five lawyers firm where one of them handles something very specific because they are _that_ good at it, then you can absolutely leverage that digitally as well.

Now, when talking about Google My Business for each law firm (the Google star-reviews left by clients) you can also create something called a “practitioner profile” that is specific for a particular lawyer. If you have John Smith, Attorney at Law, but within a practice they don’t own, you would build it out and let them get their own reviews.  From Google’s perspective, these practitioner profiles belong to the attorney. The practitioner profiles do not belong to the firm. If the attorney were to leave and the firm tried to fight to keep those reviews, the firm is going to lose.  So when you create this practitioner profile, that’s one of those leaps of faith that you say to the lawyer, _‘I’m going to build this out and help you. I’m going to put money behind it, but at the end of the day, you do own this.’_

Now, they could take it and go. But in the meantime, if you are going to put money into that build-out, you need to really think about how to optimize for that. When somebody searches for a high-asset divorce lawyer, you want that local three-pack to show at the top. You want your firm’s Google My Business to show up and you want that practitioner profile to show up as well so you are taking up 2 out of the 3 top spots. Now, in a situation where somebody searches Google but maybe they don’t want to work with a big firm and they see the attorney’s name within the practitioner profile, the searcher may want to work with them, increasing the chances of capturing revenue for your firm.

**MG: So is it similar to looking for a doctor? For example, you may live somewhere and have heard good things about a specific doctor in your area?**

**NP:** Exactly, yes. When you do your search you may find a doctor based on their Google reviews then realize they are also a member of a local family practice. You are optimizing for the practice as well as for all your lawyers.  Ultimately, this means they have more bites out of the apple.

**MG: What if Joe Smith has a client who leaves them a one-star review? Is that going to drag down the overall practice rating?**

**NP:** No, and that is what is great about keeping the separate profiles, too. That review is on John Smith’s profile with Google – and that is where the negative review lives.  Whereas your practice reviews are still what they are. They are treated as separate profiles.

The reviews are not connected. However, this can also present a problem regarding expense. When you want to have multiple profiles with Google, you cannot take your one budget and spread it across those three, for example.  You must build all three evenly because it’s as if you’re building out three completely different businesses. You must build them equally and Google charges for each separately.

**MG: When you say that a firm’s leadership should be teaching the younger folks about branding, that sounds challenging. Senior attorneys may not be as knowledgeable about digital marketing and online branding. What advice would you give for helping junior attorneys broach this topic and persuade an older Managing Partner, for example, to support their digital marketing efforts?**

**NP:** A lot of times the partners running a firm for the past 35 years or who inherited it from their parents may have forgotten they, too, wanted to make changes when they were just starting out. Now, they find themselves set in their ways. They’ve done a traditional build of their business and are resistant to change. Today, some young lawyer comes in and says, “Hey, you know, there’s this whole internet marketing thing. And I really think we should give it a chance.”

I’ve seen this battle oftentimes when an older partner is planning for their retirement and has made it known they’ll be leaving. It is then completely up to the younger folks to generate new clients, new cases…_NOW_. A lot of times the younger lawyer brings a lot of energy, their enthusiasm and excitement to update the firm’s image and brand is almost contagious. The younger attorney’s influence to update the firm’s online presence can have a great effect on growth when the senior partners are finally able to trust the burgeoning lawyers – just as their predecessors had trusted them.

I think if you are not going to take on the responsibility of staying up to date on best digital marketing practices, then keeping an open mind is the most important thing you can do. If you’re going to be in leadership and have a closed mind, how far is your business going to get? You have to evolve.

**MG: And just to dig a little deeper, updating a firm’s brand to include digital marketing comes up rather frequently when discussing general challenges of law firms but particularly when there is a parent and child dynamic involved. Business succession may be looming in the not-so-distant future so the child is motivated to update the firm’s image, which likely involves digital marketing. I’ve heard quite a few younger attorneys express frustration when trying to persuade their parent to invest in updating but the parent digs in their heels. Do you have any particular phrasing that might help a managing partner, for example, to digest the value of Google?**

**NP:** Yes. I think the problem here has a lot to do with the fact that it’s a child talking to their parents. Flipping the script so it’s a JD having a discussion with another JD, even though it may be an associate to a partner, is where the solution lies. I would say that it is that much more important for you as the younger associate to do your homework and the research to equip yourself with numbers supporting your request. The times where I’ve seen the attorney-child win the support of their attorney-parent is when the numbers make sense – when the data makes sense. So you have to do your homework, gather the research, talk to the different marketing companies, and present examples of firms who’ve taken a similar approach successfully before you present your argument.

**MG: If you had to choose 3 digital marketing tips to share with an attorney just starting their own firm, what would you recommend?**

**NP:** Using a small practice as an example. Number one, at the beginning of starting a practice you have more time than money, right? You have more resources within yourself to actually do the necessary things. Let us focus on what the items are that _you_ can do until you become the firm that has more money and no time. Then, as you grow, you start to delegate tasks. But in the very beginning, the items you might be able to handle yourself are things like Google My Business. If you don’t have one, set it up and try to get some reviews because that is something you can control. And make sure you are putting as much information as you can in all those different fields. Google provides the opportunity to tell searchers who you are and what you do. Providing more information helps rankings.

Number two: leverage your relationships. If you are a firm that is just starting out, you generally have a book of business from your old firm. Or you are doing the “boots on the ground” approach and having lunches and dinners with people, spending time on the golf course, grabbing drinks, etc. Make sure that all these relationships you are building _offline_ translate _online._ This means you are creating connections with all these other potential people and their “websites.” Ask them to talk about you on their site and give you an endorsement. Those easy, low-hanging backlinks go a long way.

And number three: have a website, develop some presence online. I know it is expensive and it is difficult in the beginning; so just go basic. Put basic content online that maybe you can write, or you can contract with someone at a lower cost to create, even if you just list your practice areas. Ideally, your website is on the WordPress platform. If you can’t afford or navigate WordPress, there are things like Wix; but know that down the road, you are probably going to have to upgrade to WordPress. So if you can swing it, try to put yourself on WordPress from the beginning. Those would be my three things.

—-PART 2—–

**MG:** **In years past, I have heard attorneys express great frustration because they paid a marketing firm large sums but didn’t see the results they felt they were promised. Do you have any suggestions on how attorneys should vet a marketing firm? What are some red flags that suggest a marketing company is not who they say they are?**

**NP:** The first to address are the attorneys who are frustrated because they paid a large sum with a digital company and feel they haven’t gotten a return. Many times these folks have not had real expectations set by the vendor. When businesses are in the sales process with digital companies, they can ask the tough questions such as, “When will I get leads?” but salespeople may try and dodge that question. Seeing a return on SEO (Search Engine Optimization) takes time. It takes a year to two years before your phone starts to ring, which is a hard thing to tell somebody when you are trying to sell them SEO. It is important for a firm to receive and understand realistic expectations on SEO and a timeline for when they can expect a return on that investment.

In addition, I always say that SEO cannot be your only hope for generating revenue at the beginning. You need to have some other form of revenue coming in, like referrals so that you can allow SEO to be this investment that can grow. Otherwise, what happens is that four months in, you are looking for results, but you just haven’t given Google enough time. Google doesn’t know who you are yet. If you stop focusing on SEO and decide to switch to another tool to generate quick leads, you are basically throwing away four months’ worth of money. Also, it is really important to honestly understand where your business is currently…what are your greatest needs right now? How quickly do you need new cases? This will help you determine the best digital marketing strategy for your firm right now.

And in terms of vetting an SEO company and what would be some red flags, I’d ask for references and data. If a company is not readily giving you solid references – clients of theirs that are getting results from their work – and if they can’t provide you with monthly reports that show deliverables are happening for their clients, that’s a red flag. Because again, the reality is, it’s effort in, effort out. If they can’t provide data showing their success, they’re probably not doing the work, and nothing’s going to happen. If someone is telling you, “Give me $15,000 a month, and I will make this happen in three months,” that is just literally impossible!

**MG: It’s the long game. So, what reports should they be receiving or expecting to receive? What should firms be measuring to track the success of a digital marketing firm’s contributions?**

**NP:** First and foremost, making sure that you can see the work that was completed. For us, for example, we show that all of our client’s technical material is correct. Here are the content pages that were put up. Here are the links that were built, and here’s what we’ve done for local content. And, here’s all the corresponding numbers. How many people have come in through that; where are you ranking? For SEO, a lot of times, the KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) are going to be your rankings. You can actually see yourself go from the bottom of Google rankings to the middle of page three, to the top of page three…slowly. Keeping track of the rankings – not necessarily looking to be number one right away – but that you are trending in the right direction. So, this is one important metric.

And, two: is your phone ringing? _This is the biggest one_ – track your call volume. What you generally find is that your call volume does not necessarily increase until your visibility is on page one.

Once you start to rank, if you are ranking and you’re not seeing your call volume also increase, there’s an issue you’ll need to investigate. But, these are the two things you should be looking at the most in those reports.

**MG:** **Regarding overall marketing value, how would you rank the following marketing tools: blogging, vlogging, SEO efforts, social media posting, mass email campaigns, etc.?**

**NP:** This is going to depend on what kind of business you run. For legal, there’s B2B, and there’s B2C. B2B is where you are trying to get other lawyers to send you referrals. Or, perhaps you are marketing to actual businesses, corporate, and or small businesses. For them, your branding is going to be the most important. You’re really putting all your money towards getting out there on billboards and TV ads and getting in front of people. You are putting time into going out and meeting these folks. Then, what happens? People Google your brand when they’re trying to remember who you are and try to find you. In that case, you would want to prioritize things like the social media posts, the vlogging (video blogs), and the mass email campaigns to stay connected with your existing, growing list of people who know you. You want to nurture those existing relationships.

Now, if you are a personal injury lawyer, criminal, immigration, etc., and doing B2C – to the consumer who is going to Google and searching, “I’ve suffered a neck injury, and I need to find a lawyer,” or, “I’m going through a divorce and need an attorney,” these are people who need your services, but don’t know your name yet. And, these are examples of where SEO should be at the top of your marketing strategy pyramid. You should be working to optimize for that. Optimizing for SEO includes blogging; it includes content such as vlogging. So, it depends on your business model as to which items are the most important for you.

**MG:** **Because we mentioned vlogging, I know that makes many attorneys nervous. I think they’re afraid it’ll look very homemade. Can you share with me why and how it’s valuable? Do you think people should jump into it? And, if so, what’s the best approach you’ve seen?**

**NP:** Yes, videos are becoming a big thing. I do think in the next couple of years…_Bold Statement_…and this is not based on anything other than my opinion, but since Google owns YouTube and Google has pushed YouTube quite a bit lately, that in the future, when you type in a question – the top three returns, the top three spots will be videos. Writing is content too, but in this TikTok world, people prefer to simply click a button and listen.

I think it’s going to be important that you have those FAQ-style videos on your site. Now with regard to how you do them, there is the world of Crisp, which is very clean, beautiful videos. They are at a higher dollar level because of their quality. But, ultimately, it really depends on what kind of brand you are trying to get across to your small-town, that is, the audience you want to appeal to. If you are a big city attorney with high-end clients, you probably want a Crisp level video because that will be on-brand for you. But if you are more of a small-town attorney or law firm, and you want to connect with middle-America, for example, you may want to do the more personalized video blog in your nice red brick building, which looks very homey and inviting, and it presents you as someone we can trust and that we want to work with in our small town.

So, no, I don’t think it is terrible if you choose to do a DIY video, especially when you have more time than money. Just get started. Simply getting content out there is going to help you. Even if you have to redo it down the road, at least you have content out there that Google knows what you do.

**MG****: And then FAQs, I have never heard of that. Is that a good topic generator to jump into vlogging?**

**NP:** If you are in your office by yourself and recording yourself, what is the easiest thing you can talk about? The answer is the frequently asked questions you get about your firm and your practice.

For example, “When does a settlement come in?” “How much can you get from an accident?” Taking those questions, you get asked about constantly and answering those in a video because you’re the expert is a great approach. You can even use these videos to send after you’ve done a consultation with somebody or for the people in your pipeline. People and prospects like information and they may have those questions.

You can repurpose it in many different ways. Most importantly, Google is able to see that you can answer questions that people are searching for, so they may provide your video to answer questions.

**MG: What about social media platforms? How would you rank those?**

**NP:** I think that one is dependent on what you are doing. If you are trying to target corporate and specific titles of people, then LinkedIn is great! LinkedIn is amazing in terms of targeting very specific industries and specific titles of individuals. It is also good for trying to do thought leadership. For professional and corporate industries, let’s say a tax attorney, LinkedIn is the media platform. Whereas Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram are a little bit more fun.

They all have their own personality. I would say that LinkedIn is for your important B2B business. I think Instagram and the stories on Instagram and Facebook as they tie together are very, very effective if you’re kind of a fun personality firm. You want to get yourself out there that way. Twitter I’ve seen used less. It is more for news and keeping up with the times versus businesses and what they’re offering. That is my personal take on it. I like Instagram and Facebook more than I do Twitter, but I think obviously you should shoot everything out on everything.

**MG: And what about TikTok for attorneys?**

**NP****:** I have seen Tik Tok be pretty successful for a few people who have the personality. The lawyer has to be taking the videos. The lawyer has to be doing the trends. If there is one of those songs that’s going on, and you are doing something funny with your kids, I’ve seen people involve their kids and make sure that they are hashtagging that in the same way so that when people are looking at that stream of the newest, crazy song, you pop up. You have to have the personality and brand for it, and it’s obviously not for everyone.

**MG:** **I can envision it working, maybe, for some of the entertainment industry attorneys we’ve served – I can imagine that it may be a fit for them.**

**NP:** Yes, exactly. Tik Tok is a fun platform. And, as we know, people hire people they like and trust. So, it could be a fun way to put yourself out there if your brand is aligned.

**MG: Okay. What about the concern of China and TikTok?**

**NP:** That is a big concern, the fear surrounding that, we hear it discussed. Many people don’t download TikTok because they are concerned with China accessing their information. We don’t run anyone’s TikTok account mainly because of that.

**MG****: Do you recommend that attorneys write and offer e-books?**

**NP:** I think the topic chosen for the e-book is really important. I think all content is always good. The more content you can put out there that makes you an expert is great. If there is a byline, such as, “This is my individual information,” showing you created this and you are the expert, it’s a good thing. I like e-books for the purpose of building backlinks, but that’s where the topic comes in. If it is a sexy topic, a topic that no one has focused on before and it is one of the first e-books out there on this topic in your industry, then obviously that is going to catch fire much more than if you were to write an e-book that 18 other lawyers in your practice area have already covered. Also, when you have a link-building team that can get on the phone and reach out to organizations who may be interested in sharing that ebook on their site with a back-link to you, it is great for you and drives SEO. That is great.

It is also a great resource to send to referrals. If lawyers are sending you referrals, you sign your ebook, you send it to them and it’s just another little touchpoint and that’s a good thing. I’m a fan of them. Again, the more resources you have, the more that can be leveraged.

**MG****: How important are high-quality graphics to a firm’s marketing success?**

**NP****:** Two years ago I would have said, “Ahhhh, while it’s important for a site’s loading speed and customer experience, quality graphics isn’t a factor that would affect your rankings. And, a year ago I might have said that it’s going to become important, we know because Google has told us that Consumer experience is going to start being measured and become a ranking factor. But, NOW, the update is out – it’s rolling out as of this summer – and Google is now really paying attention to the overall quality of your site: the site speed, for example. There are metrics now to measure that. Having high-quality photos is important as the current generation has become more and more visual – and is focusing less on written content. Those videos, those photos, they need to be good quality, but they also need to be coded properly so that they’re not causing a consumer issue, or an experience issue when scrolling on the screen.

**MG:** **Can you qualify, “good quality images or graphics?”**

**NP:** Yes, first, the subject matter of the photo – is it captivating? Or is it just a “meh” photo that other sites also have and it’s obviously from a template. You want photos and images that pop first and foremost! You want photos that are relevant. Second, in terms of quality, or the DPI (dots per inch), the size and format need to be high quality but not so large that it uses a lot of space on your site, which can slow down the load speed. Obviously, you do not want any blurry content. Another important consideration is to follow Google’s disability requirements by making sure that you are including photo tags. This helps individuals who have visual impairments, for example, to understand the description of the photo and can still provide those users with an idea of what you do and what your site offers.

**MG****: How important are grammar and punctuation, as well as working links to a site’s effectiveness and success? For instance, typos and dead links on a website are not good for the user experience, I imagine.**

**NP:** Typos and dead links are a technical problem. Google will not know where to go. When you remember that Google is a business first and foremost, they don’t want to show a website that is going to cause a consumer to have a bad experience and possibly cause that user to not want to use Google again. When we think about it that way it is easier to understand why Google does what Google does. You don’t want your site to be riddled with typos – a couple is okay and Google does leave room for human error – but keep them to a minimum. Dead links, however, are a bigger issue and will negatively impact rankings.

**MG: How valuable are good reviews and how impactful are the negative ones?**

**NP:** Positive reviews are extremely important, in general, when it comes to the “local three-pack,” we discussed which displays at the top of the first page when you do a Google search. It is great real estate. You want to make sure that these reviews are genuine and that you don’t just have all your friends leaving reviews. Google uses these reviews to gauge how many people have engaged with you and how many people have had a good experience. They even look at the words that are included in these reviews and you can see there are filters being applied. As of February of 2020, Google applies filters to the reviews. It looks at the keywords used in the reviews…and determines important phrases. And, Google recognizes “important phrases” when people who leave you a review mention the same keywords three separate times or more. So, these phrases are then what’s associated with your Google My Business.

For example, if somebody local searches for workers’ comp and because four or six people have written that you’ve helped them with their worker’s comp case, Google views this as a good business and it will increase your ranking. Google is looking at the reviews and so it is important from the Google perspective; but then there’s also the consumer side. When I check Google reviews for a business, the first thing I do is sort for the negative. Just about all businesses have positive reviews. Looking at the negative reviews can give me a more authentic understanding of how that business works. What you want to see is a small number of negative reviews (in comparison to the positive) that say things that are so insignificant, so small that it doesn’t dissuade me from calling them. If you get the ridiculous ranting negative, leave it alone. People will judge that review against all your other positive reviews and will see the good largely outweighs the bad.

If you have a negative review and you do want to address it, there are five different levels of boxes to check. You can check the one that essentially says, “I want to escalate this and get it taken off.” But if you can’t and if your situation doesn’t fit any of Google’s five boxes, the best course of action then is this: for every bad review, get five positive reviews. Just try to keep your positive average up.

**MG:** **Can you describe an ideal attorney bio page or bio content? Coming from a sales background, we were always trained to consider the WIFM (What’s in it for me?) approach to describing our products or services. So, it’s always seemed a little backward when the industry standard is for attorneys to discuss their credentials on their bio before describing HOW they benefit clients or WHY a new client would want to hire them. Thoughts?**

**NP:** Yes, this kind of goes back to what we were discussing earlier regarding an attorney’s brand. If you are the small-town attorney we described, having a bio page that leads with where you went to law school and your professional accomplishments or that you are the current President of your Bar’s section, probably isn’t going to readily connect with your target audience.

Some of the best biography pages I have seen for attorneys are the ones that connect with the consumer and the individual. Again, it cannot be stressed enough: _People hire people_ _they like and trust._ So, consider your audience and be likable, to them. Examples of things I’ve seen on these bio pages are listing your firm’s values. A person can talk about community, for example. It can be a graphic. It does not need to be pages of information. Give a little bit about your background, humanize yourself. Do you have kids? Did you play sports? What places have you traveled to? Animals and pets are always a hit with audiences looking for more of that hometown attorney! From a psychological perspective, you’re finding points of connection with the potential consumer.

Maybe they do not connect with you as a lawyer on an educational or intellectual level. But, if you talk about your kids in this or that school, or you played this sport – that’s something someone can connect with on a personal level and that may lead them to pick up the phone and call you. And, to be clear, while I do think that your biography page should be more than just your credentials, your credentials should absolutely be there. And always, you should make sure that you’re coding it properly on the backend.
