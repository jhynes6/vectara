# Document Automation: Why You Shouldn’t Be Typing the Same Documents Over and Over

Let’s be honest: your time as a lawyer is too valuable to spend copying and pasting names and clauses into the same contracts again and again. Or, for that matter, retyping the same AI prompt every time you need a document summarized, for example.

We talk to attorneys every day who are still manually creating or “tweaking” documents, rewriting messages from scratch, and relying on memory to recreate workflows. Whether it’s redoing a retainer agreement or typing _“Act as an experienced litigation paralegal…”_ into ChatGPT for the tenth time this week, it’s time to automate the repetitive and elevate your practice.

Not only is this a productivity killer—it’s a profitability killer.

In today’s legal landscape, small law firms must be lean, efficient, and client-centered. The firms that are growing fastest are the ones embracing smart systems. One of the simplest, most high-impact upgrades your firm can make? **Document automation.**

## **What Is Document Automation?**

Document automation refers to using technology to create repeatable, customizable templates for your most-used legal documents. Instead of starting from a blank Word file or digging through old client folders, you enter client-specific data into a form or software interface, and the system generates a polished, ready-to-review document in seconds.

It’s not just faster—it’s more accurate, consistent, and scalable.

## **The Real Cost of Manual Document Drafting**

Still not convinced? Let’s do the math.

If you spend 30 minutes recreating a standard contract, and you do this just 10 times a week, that’s **5 hours** gone—every week. Over a year, that’s 260 hours. Even if you delegate this to a paralegal at $55/hour (a common rate for experienced virtual paralegals through Woven Legal), that’s more than $14,000 annually spent on repetitive work that automation could handle.

And let’s not forget the time spent retyping or rewording ChatGPT prompts—time that adds up, especially if multiple team members are doing the same thing. Instead of retyping those prompts each time, **store frequently used ones in a shared document, CRM note, or even inside your [Clio](https://www.clio.com/web/woven-clio-demo/?referral_code=AP-WOVEN) Matter templates**. That way, your whole team has access and can get consistent outputs—fast.

Worse still, manual drafting introduces the risk of human error. A wrong date, an outdated clause, or a missed name substitution can lead to real legal exposure. With automation, your firm gains consistency and peace of mind.

## **How to Get Started With Document Automation**

You don’t have to overhaul your entire firm to get started. Begin with your **top 3 most frequently used documents**. These often include:

*   Client intake forms  
*   Engagement or retainer agreements  
*   Service agreements  
*   Correspondence templates  
*   Internal checklists and workflows
