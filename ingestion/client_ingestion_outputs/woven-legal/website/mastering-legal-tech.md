## A 10-Part Blog Series Leading Up to the ABA TechShow 2025

Legal technology isnâ€™t just a convenienceâ€”itâ€™s a necessity. Yet, many small law firms struggle with knowing **which tools they need, which ones theyâ€™re underutilizing, and where theyâ€™re wasting money.** With the **ABA TechShow 2025** right around the corner (**April 2-5 in Chicago**), now is the perfect time to evaluate how technology can make your law firm more efficient, profitable, and stress-free.

Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re launching a **10-part blog series** designed to help attorneys understand and optimize their tech stacks, improve efficiency, and delegate more work effectively.

## Why This Matters for Your Law Firm

According to the **[Clio Legal Trends Report](https://www.clio.com/resources/legal-trends/2024-report/)**, attorneys only spend **2.9 hours per day on billable work**â€”meaning the majority of their time is spent on administrative tasks, inefficient workflows, and redundant manual processes. The **ABAâ€™s 2022 Technology Training TechReport** also found that while **75% of firms** have tech training available, more than **60% of attorneys still feel uncomfortable using their legal software to increase efficiency.**

This means one thing: **Having technology isnâ€™t enoughâ€”you have to know how to use it effectively.**

Thatâ€™s where [Woven Legal](https://wovenlegal.com/) comes in. Our **[Productivity Center](https://wovenlegal.com/productivitycenter/)** is designed to help firms maximize their **case management software, automation tools, and delegation strategies** so attorneys can focus on practicing lawâ€”not running administrative tasks.

## What to Expect from This Blog Series

Over the next 10 weeks, weâ€™ll break down **the most important legal tech tools** and how you can use them to streamline your practice. Topics will include:
