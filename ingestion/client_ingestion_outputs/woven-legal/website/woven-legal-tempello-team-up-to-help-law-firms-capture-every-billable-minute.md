**ATLANTA – September 9, 2025** – Woven Legal, a Clio Gold Certified Partner specializing in U.S.-based fractional paralegal staffing, today announced a partnership with **Tempello**, the award-winning AI platform that transforms time tracking for law firms.

Tempello, named _Best New Integration App_ at ClioCon 2024, automatically captures billable email time, organizes email communications into Clio matter threads, and syncs entries to invoices. By uncovering missed billable hours, firms can increase revenue by a minimum of 20%.

The partnership—spearheaded by **Woven Legal Founder & Vice President Meg Garavaglia**—brings together Tempello’s AI-powered solution with Woven Legal’s Clio Optimization Audits and fractional paralegal services. The collaboration helps attorneys reduce administrative burden, streamline workflows, and maximize productivity.

> **“We’ve seen too many promises of time savings in this industry that fall short,” said John McKenna, Owner of Woven Legal. “Tempello delivers real results, and we’re excited to partner with their team while ensuring firms get the most out of such a powerful, capable tool as Clio through our optimization audits.”**

Tempello was co-founded by attorney **Jeff Dracup, Esq. (CEO)**, technologist **Alex Dracup (COO)**, and attorney **Brittany Dracup, Esq. (Chief Product Officer)**.

**“As an attorney, I know how easy it is to lose track of billable minutes,” said Jeff Dracup. “Partnering with Woven Legal allows us to reach more firms and help them capture every moment of value.”**

Together, Woven Legal and Tempello offer law firms practical, scalable solutions that improve billing accuracy, strengthen client service, and increase profitability.
