## Client Testimonials

## Thrift McLemore

_25 Attorney Law Firm, Atlanta,GA_

“What Woven Legal has done for us is to allow our attorneys to leverage the paralegal. This means they can take on more matters without losing hours they can otherwise bill. The paralegal more than pays for themself.

Woven Legal is truly a partner of our firm. I would never test the waters again with traditional recruiting or staffing.

If you choose Woven Legal, you will be satisfied, and it will benefit your law firm greatly. I can assure you that.”

[**Craig Thrift**](https://thriftlegal.com)  [– Partner/Attorney](https://thriftlegal.com)

From the beginning of our relationship with Woven Legal, we have enjoyed and benefited from the depth at which they take time to understand the position they’re hiring for, as well as considering a balance between a candidate whose skills match the role and who would be a good fit for the culture of our firm.

##### Natasha R., Director of Operations – Family Law

Becoming a client of Woven Legal has allowed us to seamlessly grow in this remote working world. Working together feels like a natural way to grow up and scale our business. Finding quality candidates who aren’t in our local area has made this process so much more inclusive. When we’re hiring for a role that can be virtual, I reach out to Woven Legal and know the process will be smooth and efficient.

##### Meghan F., Partner/Attorney – Family Law

I was in need of a patent paralegal, and Woven found a great person that I have been working with for over a year. All very well handled.

##### Andrew B.

Brittney has been fantastic and only gets better every day. Your firm did an outstanding job finding her for us. I’m confident that we’ll be increasing her hours.

##### George V.

Woven Legal’s expertise in providing top-notch, scalable support staff for the growing needs of our over 130 committed Partners will only enhance the services we provide to our clients. We are excited about the great potential that this collaboration holds.

##### Joel F., Co-Chairman of Pierson Ferdinand

I’m grateful I could call y’all and did not hesitate. I had an excellent experience last time & have recommended you to several other attorneys.

##### Stephanie S., Owner/Attorney –  
 Estate Planning & Probate

I was very happy with the support I received from your Productivity Center during a challenging transition period. Managing client responsibilities while switching firms can be overwhelming. The assistance provided was invaluable, especially with multiple complex cases that required careful attention to detail. I’m truly grateful for the help. Thank you!
