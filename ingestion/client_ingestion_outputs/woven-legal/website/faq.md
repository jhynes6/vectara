### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Staffing Questions

**Is Woven Legal a recruiting firm?**  
No, Woven Legal is a legal staffing company that places virtual legal professionals (VLP’s) with attorneys nationwide on a fractional, subscription basis. We first look to our current bench of seasoned professionals. If we don’t have the perfect fit, we do an exhaustive search nationwide – never sacrificing a great match for a “quick fix.”

**What makes Woven Legal different?**  
Each engagement is assigned an experienced Relationship Manager who guides clients through our proven processes, then remains in place to make sure clients continue to be delighted with our services. Another thing that sets us apart is our due diligence. We never settle – and are always searching for the very best Virtual Legal Professionals to serve our clients.

**What roles do you place?**  
* Virtual Paralegals – performs legal research and drafts legal documents  
* Virtual Legal Assistants – legal administrative support for attorneys and paralegals  
* Virtual Assistants for Attorneys – seasoned executive administrative assistants  
* Virtual Client Intake Specialists – conducts initial consultations about the client’s legal issue and determines if it falls within the scope of the law firm’s practice areas  
* Virtual (Insurance Defense) Paralegal Billing Coordinator – paralegal experienced in successfully navigating invoice billing denials

**How much experience are the VLP’s required to have?**  
All paralegals and legal assistants are required to have at least 3 years of in-office law firm experience as well as have experience working remotely. Many of our VLP’s have decades of experience! All other roles (such as a VA) require 3+ years of professional experience. Please call to discuss any concerns. Our vetting process is thorough and arduous and has delivered hundreds and hundreds of successful matches.

**How do you source, recruit and vet your candidates before they are matched?**  
Woven Legal promotes not only to attorneys but also to law firm support staff! Our growing online presence, abounding opportunities plus excellent reviews and reputation continue to position our company as a rewarding place for experienced VLP’s to grow their careers. But first, they have to make the cut. We are constantly recruiting top talent and receive many hundreds of resumes every week. Woven Legal’s Talent Acquisition team utilizes our proven processes, honed to identify humble, hungry and smart candidates, who have passed the following rigorous evaluations:
* 3-4 interviews with our experienced Woven Legal team members  
* Skills Assessments  
* Writing test: spelling, grammar, tone  
* Communication: responsiveness, industry best practices, coachability, etc.  
* Practice Area knowledge  
* Attention to detail  
* Tech agility  
* Background check  
* References check  
* Social media assessment

**How do I get started? How long does it take before I can meet and begin working with my Virtual Legal Professional (VLP)?**  
After signing the Woven Legal agreement and paying the Fulfillment Processing Fee, clients will promptly be introduced to their Woven Legal Relationship Manager, who will schedule the New Client Discovery Call (approximately one hour) to understand the attorney’s qualifications and responsibilities for the open position. From there, it takes our Placement Team approximately 2-3 weeks to identify a suitable candidate.

**How many VLP’s will I be presented to interview?**  
Woven Legal is all about trust. We are a small business with BIG knowledge and years of experience. So, when busy attorneys like you come to us for help – our team of experts utilizes proven processes to match you with the best VLP to serve you. We ask for your trust and allow us to take this task off your plate. If you aren’t happy with our choice, we’ll work to make it right.

**Do I get a designated paralegal or just someone that is available when I need help with a project or document?**  
You will be paired with a designated VLP who serves for a contracted number of hours per month on a consistent, long-term basis. If you are only looking for temporary or per-project support, we also have a solution – our Productivity Center! Click [here](https://wovenlegal.com/productivitycenter) to learn more.

**What do your packages look like?**  
Our packages are purchased in blocks of time starting at 40 hours per month and increasing in 20 hour increments up to 160 hours or full-time. Each package includes a designated virtual legal professional who serves for a contracted number of hours per week on a consistent, long-term basis.

**What if I originally purchased 80 hours/month when I began but now business has slowed and I only need 60 hours/month?**  
No problem, our services are flexible! Clients can increase or decrease their VLP’s contracted hours at any time by just emailing your Relationship Manager. We do require that adjustments be made in 20 hour/month increments and cannot go below the minimum of 40 hours/month.

**Can I pause your services for the holidays or while I go on vacation?**  
Our VLPs rely on a steady stream of income to maintain financial stability. Pausing engagements could create lapses in income and create a stressful environment for our VLPs. Therefore, we cannot accommodate requests to pause services.

**What if I want to quit or stop receiving services from Woven Legal?**  
We understand and are sincerely happy when attorneys are receiving the support that’s best for them – be it with us – or on your own. The Woven Legal contract requires 30 days notice to satisfy the agreement. This provides your VLP time to wrap up any projects and tasks they were working on for you and your clients – or hand off unfinished work to their replacement. Our VLP’s have even assisted their clients by vetting candidates and onboarding their replacements. Simultaneously, this 30-day period allows your VLP to secure their next new Woven Legal client they will serve and avoid any interruption to their income stream.

**What if my VLP quits/leaves? What if I request a different VLP?**  
In the event that a VLP leaves the engagement – or if you aren’t happy with our choice, Woven Legal initiates our Transition Process. Armed with even more information about your needs and qualifications for a successful match, we typically have a suitable VLP replacement in place within two weeks at no additional cost to you. (*Maximum of 3 transition placements.)

**When will my VLP work and be available to me?**  
VLP’s serve our client’s contracted time (usually) by splitting the weekly allotted hours evenly between the 5 days in a work week. For example, if a client purchases 20 hours/week, their VLP will aim to work ~ 4 hours/day within normal business hours. And, though a VLP might be serving a client part-time, we ask the VLP’s to be available to answer or respond to questions within 1-2 hours of being received between 8am-5pm so they don’t hold up our clients’ progress.

**What if I am prepping for trial and I need my VLP on evenings and weekends?**  
Woven Legal does not support our designated VLP’s serving clients after hours. However, if you are using our Productivity Center, we have a team of professionals to complete your project-based work that could offer support after hours.

**Are Woven Legal’s workers all based in the US?**  
Yes, all Woven Legal contractors and employees reside in the US.

**How do I know my VLP (virtual legal professional) is actually working and I’m getting the hours I’m paying for?**  
Every Woven Legal VLP is expected to **track their time** serving clients with precision and transparency, sharing this info with their client. Failure to do so is cause for removal from the engagement and Woven Legal.

**What if I want to hire my VLP? Can I work directly with them (without Woven Legal)?**  
Yes, the Woven Legal agreement offers provisions to buy out your VLP’s contract so the 2 of you can work together directly.

**Will I need to provide a computer, phone, etc. for my VLP?**  
All VLPs provide their own devices (computer and phone). However, some clients may choose to have their VLPs use devices provided by the firm.

**What if I don’t have enough to delegate and I can’t fill my VLP’s hours? Do hours roll over?**  
No, but, please know, we are experts at becoming Proactive Partners to the attorneys we serve. And, our team considers it a personal VICTORY when they can gently encourage their clients to identify tasks to potentially hand off and, in time, earn the attorney’s trust, allowing for greater delegation and more productivity! So, there is some wiggle room on monthly contracted hours but it is small. Please call to discuss further.

**Does Woven Legal place in-person positions?**  
Woven Legal only places virtual legal support professionals. The caliber of candidates to choose from is significantly higher when we are not constrained by geography. And, our proven processes ensure clients get what they pay for and remain delighted…or we’ll make it right.

**Problem: I always seem to hire the wrong individuals. I place hope and trust in people to do what they say they will do and, in the end, I am disappointed, having wasted time and money training them. The work and stress continue to pile up. How would you help with this?**  
**Solution:** The Woven Legal team has helped hundreds of leaders secure support staff to make our clients shine. The key is allowing us to understand you, your needs, strengths, and even weaknesses (everyone has them!) so we can match you with your very best paralegal, legal assistant, intake specialist, or administrative assistant. Woven Legal’s Relationship Managers remain connected throughout to avoid molehills becoming mountains and coaching for best performance, longevity, and maximum productivity.

**Problem: Turnover is an issue and something I hate having to deal with.**  
**Solution:** We understand. The Woven Legal team often receives calls from new clients weary of staff turnover. Rest assured, we can usually help. Woven Legal is experienced and successful in identifying the best people to serve attorneys and law firms nationwide. Then we stay connected, coaching for best practices as needed to ensure our clients remain delighted with the candidates and results.

**Problem: Staffing a full-time Paralegal is expensive, and I only need someone for about 20 hours per week. Can you locate a qualified and experienced fractional paralegal for me?**  
**Solution:** Absolutely. We have years of experience vetting for remote workforces and know the value of only staffing for what is needed. You will feel supported by your VLP (paralegal, legal assistant, intake specialist, etc.) who will have your best interests in mind and won’t cost you as a direct employee would. We work hard to source humble, hungry, and smart professionals as fractional, scalable staff.

**Problem: My paralegal is going to need access to privileged and confidential information. What’s the best way to set this up?**  
**Solution:** This is a common question posed by our clients and upon gaining an understanding of your practice and workflow, we can better direct you. There are many resources and methods we have seen clients use to achieve optimal security.

**How does Woven Legal check for conflicts?**  
**Solution:** Once the VLP is chosen for a particular client assignment and learns the client’s name and firm name, the VLP must self-report if she is aware of a conflict in serving the particular attorney. If a conflict is identified later, the paralegal promptly notifies the attorney. They provide details about the conflict, including the parties involved and the nature of the conflict, allowing the attorney to make an informed decision on how to proceed.
