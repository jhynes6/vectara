## 9 Ways Law Firms Can Still Be Involved Despite Inclement Weather

Unfortunately, MLK, Jr. Day is not getting a warm welcome in much of the United States today due to erratic weather conditions affecting a large percentage of the population. From Winter Storm Izzy on the East coast to Tsunami conditions on the west coast, as well as record snowfalls and wind chill alerts occurring in much of the Midwest, many MLK day events are sadly being canceled or postponed. Law firms across the country – excited to spend this workday volunteering in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King, took to social media today in frustration and disappointment when such great intentions didn’t come to fruition. So, Woven Legal has put together nine ways in which you could still contribute today: by attending events virtually, through a donation made online, or perhaps by getting the ball rolling and signing up to participate in future volunteer opportunities when weather conditions may be safer and more accommodating.

_Read Founder/Attorney David Lee Windecher’s book by clicking_ [_HERE_](https://davidwindecher.com/book/)_._

I read David’s book in 2016, shortly after our initial meeting in Atlanta. I found it impactful; it expanded my understanding of what it means to be an immigrant child growing up on the streets of Miami, and I have since shared the book with many of my friends and colleagues. Here’s my short synopsis: Arrested 13 times and after spending 7+ months as an incarcerated juvenile, David, a skinny immigrant kid, succumbed to the pressures of joining a Miami gang for the protection it provided, eventually dropping out of school and adopting the street name Red. But, despite being surrounded by – or perhaps because of – a culture of violence and lawlessness, David harbored a dream of becoming a lawyer and fighting for those who didn’t have the resources to seek justice for themselves. With Olympic-level drive and fierce determination, David secured his GED in 1998, followed by a (Summa Cum Laude) undergraduate degree in 2005, and completed his JD from John Marshall Law School in Atlanta, Georgia, in 2012. David was admitted to the Georgia Bar in 2012 and the Florida Bar in 2014. He has been recognized many times both personally and professionally, some of which include the following: Recipient of Martindale-Hubbell’s Client Distinction Award, 2013, 2014, 2015; awarded “40 Under 40” by Atlanta Business Chronicle and Georgia Trend Magazine; a frequent guest and/or legal analyst speaking on television and radio programs (regionally/nationally). And, his law practice specializes in criminal defense, juvenile law, and expungement procedures. Help David and his team [fight recidivism today](https://stoprecidivism.org/support/) by donating, mentoring, guest writing, or becoming an advocate.
