## Client Testimonials

##### Galvin Kennedy  
– The Kennedy Law Firm

“As a modern law firm, I wanted to run my office and staff virtually. However, after I hired several remote contractors for various projects from marketing and bookkeeping to paralegal work and vendor relations, I quickly became the hub for all of these workers. I needed a central operation manager to help with all of it. That’s where Woven Legal stepped in as a one-stop shop to handle all of these needs. Every time a new project comes up, I contact Caroline and she identifies the right fit person on her team to work on the project.”
