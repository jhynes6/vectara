# Test Test

## Thrift McLemore

_Business Law Firm, GA_

What Woven Legal has done for us is to allow our attorneys to leverage the paralegal. This means they can take on more matter without losing hours they can otherwise bill. The paralegal more than pays for themself.

Woven Legal is truly a partner of our firm. I would never test the waters again with traditional recruiting or staffing.

If you choose Woven Legal, you will be satisfied, and it will benefit your law firm greatly. I can assure you that.

Craig Thrift â€“ Partner/Attorney
