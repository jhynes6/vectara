Campaign Criteria

Targeting

Describe your top three target personas (clients): 
 We sell to Marketing Directors/Decision makers  in the Private school space with greater than $25,000 in average annual tuition.
 We sell to Admissions Decision makers in the private school space with greater than $25,000 in average annual tuition
 We sell to Advancement/Fundraising decision makers in the private school space with greater than $25,000 in annual tuition. 
 privateschoolreview.com is a good resource
 Let’s discuss this - there is a lot of nuance in how we segment/target our prospective clients.
 Are there industries you won’t sell to? 
 We ONLY sell to K-12 Private and Independent Schools.
 10/8 - ONLY going after US based schools

Offerings

What services do you sell to your top 3 target personas? (ex. PPC, Social Content, Email Marketing) 
 We sell the same package across personas. School website SaaS platform with unique data by design process, advanced analytics, user behavior tracking, and on-going white-glove consultancy.
 For each service, what are your top offers (packages/examples) that you would be willing to pitch them?

Cost of Services

What is your average order value? What are your “Starting At” costs for your services?
 Cost should not be discussed in any email campaign. Please reach out to us if any pricing questions arise. Avg selling price 29.5k/year. Total range is 15-45k/year. 

Service Differentiation

What makes you different from your competitors? What is your “special sauce”?
 We have a unique approach to website development that involves a large data audit/analysis, persona mapping exercise and fully bespoke design. Our platform is able to track user behavior, provides AI driven personality insights/communication tools, and full marketing workflow tool. We are the only provider optimizing our websites post launch through our white-glove on-going consultancy with each client. Additionally we do not charge a large up front fee for our designs which is unique to our company.
 Our open API / integrations are exceptional. We are Blackbaud’s premiere partner for websites and we have a best in class integration with their solutions. We also have a best in class integration with Veracross. Blackbaud and Veracross are the two leading school solution (student information system, enrollment platforms, etc.) providers in our industry.
 It’s worth noting there is a lot of vendor fatigue in this industry. Our new-ish reputation is helping us substantially. People are tired of the major players in this space (Finalsite/Blackbaud/Wordpress)

Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? What do you do to improve their business?
 Our enrollment is strong, but we are always looking to strengthen our applicant pool/reach more mission aligned candidates earlier in the admissions process. 
 Solution: Mapping out your personas during our initial design process helps strengthen a prospective families user journey across your site leading to higher rates of conversion. Our digital experience platform tracks user behavior so your admissions team can see what candidates are most interested in across your site, which can help identify more mission aligned candidates earlier in their journey with the school. 
 2 part example (this is a common combo we hear) - 1) Our website is clunky and difficult to use. We don’t have the ability to edit things to our satisfaction and the design is not doing anything to differentiate us from our competitors. Our provider does not offer robust support without charging a significant fee. 2) The integrated email marketing tools in our platform are inadequate and we are having to use a third party for email marketing which creates a lot of extra work to ensure our mailing lists are accurate against our Admissions Database.
 Solution: Our easy to use CMS platform includes a full in-line editor that allows you to edit your site to your exact specifications. 
 Fundraising needs are always prevalent and/or have a large capital campaign in the works with a very large monetary goal. 
 Solution: We can help advancement teams to be good stewards of their donors and we provide a good sense of what the donors are interested in within the school community. Our integrated AI tools help build profiles to better understand your donors, what interests are they most passionate about, best communicating how the donation will directly affect their interests at the school. Our virtual assistant helps to construct speaking points for conversations with them, tones to use in your messaging, suggested times to reach out for higher success rates, whether a phone call, email, or in person meeting is what the individual prefers, etc.  
 Portals are outdated and we wish to better distinguish various pieces of information from our public-facing site vs a portal or current families site. We'd like to better protect our current students, families, and faculty data while also streamlining only pertinent information to our prospective families.
 Solution: We can create microsites that provide a totally different experience for your current families, alumni, and even new families who will attend but have yet to start. This portal microsite can be listed/unlisted and even password-protected should you wish. Our API and integration capabilities will allow schools to update their directories, calendars, or schedules in one place only, display them in new and exciting ways on their site, and keep the information viewable to your selected audience.
