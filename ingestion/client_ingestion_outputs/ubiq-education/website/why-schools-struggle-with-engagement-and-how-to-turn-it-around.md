## Why Schools Struggle with Engagement-

**and How to Turn It Around.**

Posted in [Explore](/the-hub)

**Schools spend a lot of time crafting messages, sending updates, and trying to keep everyone in the loop, yet there’s a common frustration: it feels like no one’s paying attention. Sound familiar? You're not alone.**

Parents’ inboxes are crammed with unread emails, and students are bombarded with notifications from every direction. It’s no wonder your well-thought-out communications can sometimes feel like they're disappearing into a void. For context, **[a global survey conducted in Feb 2024 reported 58% of marketing leaders said they’ve automated their marketing efforts](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1269813/marketing-channels-automation/)** \[J.G Navarro, Statista, 2024\].

**But here’s the good news**—fixing this is within your reach. After exploring **[how AI and social media can boost your school’s engagement](/unlock-your-schools-growth-with-ai-and-social-media)** in our previous post, let’s now dig into why things aren’t clicking and how to revamp your approach.

* * *

### The Real Issue: It's Not Just About Sending Messages

If you’re wondering why your school’s communications aren’t resonating, it might be time to rethink your strategy. The problem usually isn’t the platform or the frequency, but a deeper issue: Are you truly connecting with your audience?

* * *

1.  **Your Audience is Overwhelmed**
Parents, teachers, and students all have overflowing inboxes. In a world where everyone is constantly bombarded with information, your school’s message has to stand out—not just be another task on their to-do list. Our Communication Hub provides a centralised platform for all your communications, ensuring that essential messages are prioritised and reach the right audience without getting lost in the noise.

2.  **The Messaging Feels Disconnected**
Even when your emails get opened, what are they saying? If your messages bounce between topics without a clear purpose or connection to what your school values, you’re going to lose people’s interest fast. Our Content Management System (CMS) enables schools to develop cohesive messaging strategies, allowing you to craft messages that align with your mission and keep your community engaged.

3.  **Your Communication Isn’t Personal Enough**
In a time when everything from ads to emails is tailored to the individual, sending out generic updates doesn’t cut it anymore. People engage more when they feel like you’re speaking directly to them and research shows it. **[90% of leading marketers say personalisation significantly contributes to business profitability](https://www.sender.net/blog/personalization-statistics/#:~:text=Personalization%20ROI%20and%20Conversion%20Statistics,-We've%20talked&text=90%25%20of%20leading%20marketers%20say,costs%20by%20up%20to%2050%25.)** \[Sender, July 2024\]. With our AI-Driven Analytics, you can gain insights into your audience’s preferences and behaviours, allowing you to send tailored messages that truly resonate.

### How to Bring Engagement Back to Life

You don’t need to completely overhaul your communication system, but small, meaningful shifts can make a huge difference. For example, **[83% of marketers see social media boosting exposure, 73% see increased traffic, and 65% report more leads](https://www.statista.com/statistics/188447/influence-of-global-social-media-marketing-usage-on-businesses/)** \[Statista, 2024\].

**Here’s how to get started.**

1.  **Make Your Motives Crystal Clear**
Think about this: What does your school stand for? Every communication should reflect the core values you want to highlight. Whether it’s academic success, community involvement, or inclusion, make sure your messages carry the weight of what’s most important to your school. When your audience sees those values consistently, they’ll feel more connected. Our Branding Toolkit helps schools create engaging content that showcases their mission, ensuring that your audience feels connected to your vision.
2.  **Consistency is Key, But So is Timing**
Stop sending messages just for the sake of it. Be strategic. Create a rhythm to your communication that parents and students can count on. Instead of bombarding inboxes with reminders, use our Communication Scheduler to ensure important updates are delivered at optimal times, making it easier for your audience to stay informed without feeling overwhelmed.
3.  **Get Personal with Your Audience**
AI is no longer just a buzzword—it’s your best friend when it comes to personalised communication. Use data from our Insight Platform to craft messages that speak directly to your audience. Whether it's celebrating individual student achievements or inviting parents to events that align with their interests, personalised communications fosters engagement.
4.  **Open the Dialogue**
Engagement is a two-way street. Create easy ways for parents, students, and staff to give feedback or ask questions. The more they feel like their voice matters, the more likely they are to engage. Our Feedback Tools facilitate real-time communication and feedback mechanisms, allowing your community to share their thoughts and stay involved.

* * *

### The Bottom Line:

**Better Communication Leads to Better Connection**

The struggle with low engagement doesn’t have to be your school’s reality. By aligning your communications with your school’s values, delivering messages consistently, and making them feel personal, you can turn things around and create a stronger connection with your community.

At UBIQ, we know how important it is for schools to communicate effectively. Whether it’s through AI-powered personalization or insights driven by data, we’re here to help you build a communication strategy that makes sure your school’s voice is not just heard—but listened to.
