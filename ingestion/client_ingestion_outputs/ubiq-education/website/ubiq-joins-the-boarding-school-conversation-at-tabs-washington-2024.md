We are thrilled to announce that UBIQ will be a lead sponsor at the 2024 TABS Annual Conference, taking place in Washington, D.C. This event is a vital opportunity for boarding school leaders and educators to connect, share ideas, and discuss the latest trends in education.

Join Catherine Mueller and Brad Berghoff, at our booth as we explore how our innovative, data-driven marketing solutions are reshaping the admissions landscape. We will showcase our AI-powered platform, AMAIS™, and how it can enhance your school’s engagement with prospective families.

This year's conference theme emphasises the importance of collaboration and shared learning in navigating the ever-evolving educational landscape. We look forward to discussing how UBIQ can support your school’s mission and help you thrive in a competitive environment.

**We can’t wait to see you at TABS 2024 and engage in meaningful conversations about the future of boarding schools!**
