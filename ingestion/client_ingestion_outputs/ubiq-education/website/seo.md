## Frequently Asked Questions

What is SEO for schools?

**Search Engine Optimization (SEO) for Schools** is the strategic process of enhancing a school's online content to enhance visility when users search for you. By carefully writing, organizing, and structuring the material, as well as well as tactically aligning your activities off the website (e.g. on review sites, social media and more) it aims to elevate the visibility of your school in search engine results pages (SERPs) and gain meaningful website traffi. This optimization targets specific phrases and keywords that are most relevant to your potential users.

Just like SEO in the commerical world, SEO for educational institutions is done through several tactics. You'll get the best results when you combine technical SEO, on-page and, off-page activities.

### Why is SEO important for schools?

SEO is crucial for schools because—when executed correctly—it significantly enhance their online visibility and google ranks. This drives an increase in traffic from the right audiences, leading to higher enrollment rates.

SEO is often seen as a long-term effort. However, when done correctly and consistently, it can provide great benefits for schools. These benefits include:

*   Reducing PPC costs for branded and local searches, making it a cost-effective marketing strategy.
*   Diverting users from external content sources like third-party school ranking lists and review sites, thereby controlling the narrative around the school’s image.

This is why it's so important for schools to adopt SEO in house or hire a specialist SEO agency for schools.

### How do you do SEO for Schools?

Implementing SEO for schools shares similarities with commercial SEO practices but is tailored to meet educational needs. Effective SEO strategy involves several key steps:

*   **Keyword Research:**  As a seasoned school marketer you'll already know a great deal about your audiences. Using current persona insights, you need to find the search terms users might type into search engines. This is when they look for your school or its competitors.
*   **Content creation or revision:**  Align your keyword research with existing copy. If you spot gaps, you'll need to develop high-quality, informative content that addresses the needs and questions of your audience, incorporating the targeted keywords in a natural way. Black-hat SEO techniques haven't worked for years now, so it's important you prioritize your users and fulfilling their needs quickly and seamlessly.
*   **On-Page SEO:**  On individual pages, the target keyword should be present, where naturally appropriate; in headings, alt tags for images, the page url, links and rich media.
*   **Technical SEO**:  Next you'll need to ensure your website is technically optimized for SEO by improving site speed, mobile responsiveness, and usability best practices.
*   **Monitor and Optimize:**  Google Search Console, is a free and often under-rated tool. It's a great way to monitor the performance of your SEO efforts.

### What about SEO for International Schools?

Whilst we often work closely with private schools in the UK and US, SEO for international schools (espcially those recently established) is essential for driving awareness in the crucial first few years of opening.

### How do Search Engine algorithms work?

Search engines are designed to give users the most relevant and useful information possible. To do that they use automated programs called bots or spiders to discover and analyze web pages. They then use complex algorithms to determine which pages are most relevant to a user's query.

There are various factors and signals that influence how search engines rank your site - so if you're a school marketer, like any business wanting to thrive online, you'll need to give your web pages the best chance of ranking higher in search results by spending a little time on SEO.

This means creating content that aligns with what your primary audiences (fee payers, prospective students and parents), and secondary audiences (staff, existing parents and others) are searching for.

There are many signals and tactics you can use to improve your SEO such as:

*   **Relevance of content**  - First and foremost ensure your content matches the intent of the search queries
*   **Quality and depth**  - Content is still king, and you'll need to supply comprehensive useful infromation if you want to outrank competitors.  
*   **User friendliness**
*   **Mobile-friendliness**
*   **Page load speed**
*   **Backlinks**  from reputable sources
*   **Clear site structure**  with logical navigation and descriptive URLs that include relevant keywords
*   Implement an  **XML sitemap**  to guide search engines through your site
*   Use  **robots.txt files**  to direct crawler behavior
