# UBIQ X Workshop About Us

## Creative websites  
For International Schools

**For schools who outgrew their template three years ago.**

### Award Winning Websites

**As a leading supplier of [award-winning websites](/best-school-websites-2025), we know what it takes to achieve a standout international school website that fits your budget and timeline.**

The best school websites don't use templates or themes. With Ubiq, you can always expect high quality design and expert guidance tailored to your school’s needs, despite your budget or timeline.

### Why Schools

### Choose Ubiq

It’s no surprise that international admissions are becoming more crowded, more complex, and more demanding. So, we do what we do best: help schools rise above the noise.

At Ubiq, we believe that your website should be your hardest-working asset, your strongest ally in a competitive global market. So, we set out to build websites that deliver results—with data, strategy and creative flair at the centre of every Ubiq build.

_**The bottom line?**_ A Ubiq website enables schools to create seamless user journeys, data-led marketing, and real differentiation from the schools you’re up against.

Building an international brand isn’t easy. It takes clarity, creativity, and a platform that keeps working for you long after launch. That’s what we do: bespoke websites that don’t just look good, they do the job they were made for.
