# UBIQ Achieves SOC 2  Compliance

**Elevating Trust and Security in School Website Solutions**

**Date Published:** Thursday 12th June 2025

After 12 months of dedicated effort across multiple teams, we're proud to announce that **UBIQ is now officially SOC 2 compliant**, with certificate in hand. This milestone underscores our unwavering commitment to providing secure, reliable, and cutting-edge digital experiences for independent schools.

## What is SOC 2  Compliance?

SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls 2) is a rigorous auditing framework developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ([AICPA](https://www.aicpa-cima.com/home)). It evaluates an organization's controls related to five Trust Services Criteria: security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. Achieving SOC 2 compliance means that an independent auditor has verified our systems and processes meet these stringent standards, ensuring we handle our partnering schools' data with the utmost care and integrity.

## Why This Matters to Our  Partner Schools

In today's digital landscape, data security is more than just a technical concern. We recognise that, by achieving SOC 2 compliance, we are signalling to our partnering schools that we care about and can be trusted with their data. For schools, this trust is paramount when selecting partners to manage sensitive information. By achieving SOC 2 compliance, UBIQ demonstrates:

* **Enhanced Data Protection**: We've implemented robust controls to safeguard your data against unauthorized access and breaches.
* **Operational Excellence**: Our processes are designed for reliability and integrity, ensuring consistent performance and service delivery.
* **Regulatory Alignment**: Our compliance positions you to better meet regulatory requirements related to data privacy and security.

## A Unique Offering in the  Educational Sector

UBIQ stands alone as the only provider delivering enterprise-level website and marketing/communications software tailored specifically for independent schools. Our SOC 2 compliance further solidifies our position as a leader in this space, offering you peace of mind that your digital infrastructure is in secure hands.

> Achieving SOC2 has been a major aim of the business for the last 12-18 months. Given we are the fastest growing website, marketing and communications provider in the world right now, it's important to make sure that our approach to security, data protection, availability and privacy not only keeps pace with the business - but acts as a north star in guiding our strategic decision making.  
>  Dan Clarke, CEO of UBIQ Education

## Looking  Ahead

While achieving SOC 2 compliance is a significant accomplishment, it's not our endpoint. Our customers know that we are committed to continuous improvement within our products. This mindset extends to our data security, regularly reviewing and enhancing our security measures to adapt to evolving threats and ensure ongoing compliance.  

Thank you for trusting UBIQ as your partner in digital excellence. Together, we're building a more secure and innovative future for education.
