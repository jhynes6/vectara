## Unlock your School’s Growth

**with AI & Social Media**

Posted in [Explore](/the-hub)

**We told you in our last blog we would tell you how you could combine Social Media and AI - well true to our word, here's the inside track.**

* * *

Recently we explored how **[recent changes in tax laws and how vat being imposed on schools fees](/uks-independent-school-tax-increase-what-to-know)** could open the door for school marketers to unleash their creativity. But let’s face it — creativity thrives when paired with efficiency. Enter AI and social media, two modern powerhouses that, when used strategically, can help schools connect, engage, and grow their communities faster than ever.

While retrieving VAT might bolster the budget, it’s the smart use of social media and AI that will make your marketing efforts soar, from student recruitment to nurturing your current community. Let’s dive into how your school can leverage these tools to stand out, stay relevant, and ultimately drive admissions.

### The Future Is Short and Snappy: AI-Enhanced Video Creation

Short-form videos are where it’s at — **[in 2023, 33% of surveyed traffic came from short-form videos](https://www.statista.com/chart/29879/social-media-content-formats/)** \[Felix Richter, Statista April 2023\] and that’s only set to increase into 2025. The best part? Creating them doesn’t need to be a time sink. Thanks to AI tools like Klap, schools can take long-form content, like a recorded assembly or school tour, and turn it into bite-sized, shareable videos in no time. Imagine taking a 10-minute video and getting a 30-second social clip, complete with engagement ratings and all, in less than a minute.

You don’t have to be a content wizard to make this happen either. AI takes care of the heavy lifting, while you fine-tune it to reflect your school’s brand. It’s efficient, effective, and engaging — the perfect combo for reaching busy parents and students.

### Let AI Do the Listening: Social Media Insights on Autopilot

The beauty of AI is that it doesn’t just create content — it can help you understand what’s working and what’s not its adoption is picking up speed. **[As of 2023 it was reported that 35% of businesses now use AI-driven solutions](https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/turning-data-gold-10-ai-marketing-campaign-examples/)** \[Artificial Intelligence News, 2023\]. Social listening tools, like Brandwatch and Sprout Social, are designed to monitor conversations about your school and pick up on key trends and feedback.

Think of it as your personal assistant, keeping an ear to the ground while you focus on the bigger picture. It’ll tell you what your audience cares about, what’s gaining traction, and where your competitors are making moves. Armed with these insights, you can tailor your marketing strategy to engage your audience on a deeper level. Now here’s where UBIQ takes things up a notch. Our AI-powered recommendation engine doesn’t just react to data; it predicts what potential prospects are looking for. It serves up personalised content that feels tailor-made to each prospect. Imagine having a tool that knows exactly what kind of message will resonate at the right moment.

Then we have **our chatbot**. It’s not just answering questions - it's learning. As it interacts with users, it refines it's responses, offering a more human, helpful experience. It's like having an admissions assistant that never sleeps, guiding visitors through the entire process.

UBIQ’s platform even gets proactive with its insights. Using predictive analytics, it helps you anticipate what your audience will do next, so you can guide them toward that all-important enrollment decision. All of this works together to help you connect on a deeper level with prospects, and that’s what truly drives engagement.

### Visuals That Stand Out — Without the Hassle

In a world where visuals reign supreme, you need something that catches the eye. But creating custom visuals takes time, and not every school has a dedicated design team. Enter Canva’s Magic Design feature. With just a few prompts, this AI tool can whip up professional, on-brand graphics in minutes.

Got an open house coming up? Enter a few details, and Canva will generate an event graphic that matches your school’s colours and logo. The result? High-quality visuals that don’t just communicate but captivate — and you didn’t have to spend hours on them.
