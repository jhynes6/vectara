Experience Director

## Meet Susie

![](https://ubiq.static.amais.com/6-980.png?version=638743683363970000)

Posted in [Explore](/the-hub)

For over a decade, Susie Cain was on the frontlines of school marketing, serving as Marketing and Communications Director at a private school in San Francisco. During her tenure, she founded a consortium for local school marketing and communications leaders (BAISCOMM) to share resources and referrals, seek peer counsel and mentorship, and ultimately define best practices in the field. For Susie, this brain trust of professionals was a source of innovation and inspiration, and a true asset while navigating school communications during the pandemic! Susie's background in education also includes a marketing and communications role for an organization focused on providing professional development for teachers.

With extensive experience within the education sector, Susie understands the unique challenges schools face in today’s competitive landscape. Now, as an Experience Director at UBIQ, she’s on a mission to make school marketers’ lives easier by helping them harness the power of data, strategy, and smart technology.

### Schools' strategic partner

**"The school teams I work with know their communities—current families, employees, board members—inside and out and have great instincts about what will resonate with their constituents. My job is to take that expertise and marry it with what we see in the DXP ([Digital Experience Platform](http://what-are-digital-experience-platforms-and-why-are-they-important)) to bring data to life. Together, we turn insights into actionable strategies that are tailored to each particular school.**

Every school has different goals, challenges, and opportunities. That’s why Susie takes a tailored approach, ensuring each school’s DXP is configured to deliver the most relevant, helpful data possible. From there, she works alongside school marketing teams to analyse trends, test new ideas, and measure success.

> “Working with UBIQ has been an exceptional experience that has far surpassed our expectations,” **\- Marguerite Estes,** _Director of Marketing & Admissions at The Dunham School_

### Data-driven, but always human

For Susie, data isn’t just about numbers but also about real impact.

"I always say, ‘We can try it and see.’ Testing is the best way to know what works, and with the DXP’s ability to track and measure results, there’s no reason not to experiment. Being able to showcase success is a big deal; equally important is the ability to see what's not working. The best part is when a school can see the true ROI on their marketing activities - not just page visits, but conversions that bolster the admissions pipeline," Susie says.

>  “These insights have revolutionized our marketing approach by enabling us to create more personalized connections with prospective families, which has allowed us to foster meaningful relationships in ways we previously couldn’t.” **\- Marguerite Estes,** _Director of Marketing & Admissions at The Dunham School_

### Helping schools become tech wizards!

Beyond data insights, Susie plays a key role in onboarding new UBIQ clients. "Every school website we build is custom, which means every school’s [**UBIQ AMAIS**](/technology) platform is unique to them. That’s why we don’t just hand over a manual and say ‘good luck’—we provide 1:1 training to ensure teams feel confident and in control."

This personalized training empowers schools to unlock the full potential of their platform, giving them flexibility and freedom without feeling overwhelmed by technical complexity.

### Why this work matters

At the heart of everything Susie does is a passion for education.

"As a former school marketer, I know firsthand how hard these teams work—often on tight budgets, with limited resources, and wearing many hats. I love being able to support marketing strategy as an extended member of the team."

It’s this sense of partnership that makes the role of an Experience Director so special. "The best part of my job is collaborating with school leaders who are enthusiastic about elevating their website and marketing strategy. When we achieve a ‘_wow_’ moment together—when a school sees clear evidence that their strategy is working—it’s a celebration for all of us. That’s what fills my cup."
