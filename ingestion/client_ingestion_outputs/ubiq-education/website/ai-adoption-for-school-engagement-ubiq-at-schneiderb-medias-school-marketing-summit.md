At UBIQ, we’re all about pushing boundaries and changing the game. That’s why we’re excited to be sponsoring an event that’s going to do just that - revolutionise how schools engage with prospective students and families through the power of AI.

On Oct 2nd, the Brendan Schneider of SchneiderB Media we’ll be bringing together some of the brightest minds in the industry to dive into how AI is shaping the future of school marketing and engagement:

*   Dan Clarke, CEO of UBIQ  
*   Jodache Johnson, Founder of “Never Tech Behind”  
*   Eric Hudson, founding of “Eric Hudson Consulting”  
*   Cathy McPhillips, Chief Growth Officer at “Marketing AI Institute”  
*   Brian Piper, Director of Content Strategy at the University of Roehampton  

This isn’t just another event - it’s the start of something big. Our panel will cover how AI can go beyond enhancing communication strategies to help schools create deeper, more authentic connections with prospects.

As the event sponsor, UBIQ is proud to be at the heart of this with SchneiderB Media, leading the way as we help schools embrace AI and all its potential. If you’re looking to get ahead and reimagine your approach to student engagement, this is where you need to be.
