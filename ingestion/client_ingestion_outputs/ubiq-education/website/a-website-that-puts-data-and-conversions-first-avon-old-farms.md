The school boasts a defined program around **lifelong learning** and preparing their students for life, teaching boys to be good brothers and good people.

### Building a Website Aligned to Avon Old Farms School's Unique Mission

##### The Challenge

The school's existing site had a **templated** nature which offered **limited customization** despite having an in-house web developer capable of more advanced work. There was an underlying feeling that the **previous vendor's designs felt too similar to others**, failing to provide the **unique differentiation Avon Old Farms sought in a competitive industry**, and offered **minimal ongoing support or feedback**.

##### The Solution

The primary goal for the website was to create a **unique and engaging online presence** that no other school had seen before. UBIQ delivered a **collaborative**, **process-driven partnership** that resulted in a **clean**, **distinctive** design built around Avon Old Farms’ identity, plus **first-party analytics** that empower their marketing team with actionable insights.

##### Results

*   A true partnership, with the UBIQ team understanding Avon’s needs and demonstrating a genuine commitment praised for responsiveness.
*   A structured process, driving the project forward by engaging with Avon Old Farms at key touchpoints throughout discovery, design, content building, and launch. The project began with fundamental questions to define the team's main goals.
*   A clean, purposeful website design, reflecting the school’s unique goals and needs. After truly listening, UBIQ framed the design and diagonal elements around the school’s ‘split A’ logo.
*   A collaborative rollout process, building internal relationships at Avon by involving stakeholders, gathering input, and fostering excitement for launch.
*   A data-driven foundation, enabling confident marketing decisions through full cross-funnel visibility into persona behaviors and engagement.

### Standing out from the Crowd

Like many schools, Avon Old Farms faced a common digital frustration: a templated website that looked and felt too much like everyone else’s. Despite having an in-house web developer, the platform limited what could be done, leaving the marketing team without a truly differentiated online presence.

**_Our previous website just wasn’t unique enough. We know Avon is different, but the website felt like every other school’s, and it didn’t offer us any feedback to improve the user experience._**

_Jacqueline Keller_
_Director of Marketing and Communications
Avon Old Farms_Beyond design, the lack of analytics and ongoing support meant that the site functioned more as a digital brochure than a marketing engine. For a school approaching its centennial — a once-in-a-generation opportunity to tell its story — this wasn’t enough.

### Why UBIQ?

Avon Old Farms didn’t want **just another static site** and an **updated template**. They wanted a digital partner who could serve as an **extension of their small marketing team**. Jacqueline Keller recommends UBIQ to other schools, emphasizing that its **effectiveness depends on the school’s capabilities**, as it involves a learning curve and constant iteration to leverage its full potential. She asserts that UBIQ is the **right choice for marketing** because of the tools it provides to inform data-driven decisions.

Jacqueline Keller, Director of Marketing & Communications, recalls the moment UBIQ stood out:

> ‘’UBIQ felt like an added team member from the very start. Beginning with a very real and personable sales approach and a pitch showcasing that a website isn’t just about design, but starts with data — they offer meaningful insights and support that provide a level of insight we couldn’t achieve on our own. **\- Jacqueline Keller**

The Avon Old Farms team was particularly drawn to **UBIQ’s data-driven approach**. Instead of relying on gut feel or **siloed requests**, they wanted a site that would give them the **numbers and insights to back up decisions** — and even push back when needed.

### The Process: Structure Meets Creativity

From kickoff, **UBIQ’s team** — Catherine, Dan, Rosie, Susie, and Steve Cole — worked alongside **Avon Old Farms** with a **structured**, **transparent** process. The UBIQ team used project management tools to stay on track and weekly meetings provided peace of mind.

**When the first design landed, Jacqueline and her team were stunned — not because it needed revisions, but because it didn’t.**

> **We were shocked. The initial design was clean, unique, and tied to our identity. We didn’t change a thing — which never happens.**

The design leveraged Avon Old Farms’ 'split A' logo and diagonal visual language, creating **something distinctive yet intuitive**. It immediately captured attention internally and built excitement for launch. Check out their website in full below.

### The Impact: Efficiency, Buy-In, and Data Confidence

The new website quickly began proving its value. Not just as a marketing tool, but as a catalyst for collaboration across the school.

*   **Internal Collaboration**
The rollout process became an unexpected opportunity to build relationships with stakeholders, who were invited to give input on specific pages. Instead of nitpicking, departments felt heard and were energized by the launch.

*   **Content Efficiency**
The site also unlocked efficiency gains. Jacqueline’s team repurposed high-quality student voice videos for use across different platforms, extending the reach of content without stretching the team’s limited time and resources.

*   **Marketing Confidence**
Perhaps most importantly, the data insights from UBIQ’s platform gave the marketing team confidence. Instead of bowing to unsupported requests, they could point to analytics that clarified what resonated with families.

*   **Community Engagement**
Early feedback was overwhelmingly positive. After promoting the site in the school’s magazine, alumni and families flocked to explore — paying such close attention that one alumnus reached out, flagging that a basketball photo deep in the athletic pages showcased a losing scoreboard and should be replaced.

* * *

> UBIQ is the right choice for schools serious about marketing. If you want more than a template — if you want data, collaboration, and a true partner — **this is the team**.”
