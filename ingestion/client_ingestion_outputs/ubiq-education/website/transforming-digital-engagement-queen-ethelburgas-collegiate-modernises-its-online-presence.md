# Transforming Queen Ethelburga’s Online Engagement Strategy

## Overview

**Queen Ethelburga's Collegiate**, a prestigious independent school renowned for its exceptional academic standards and diverse offerings, faced a pivotal challenge—modernising its outdated website to better serve prospective families and streamline internal processes. Partnering with UBIQ, the school sought to create a dynamic, marketing-focused platform capable of tracking customer journeys, providing data-driven insights, and supporting a more targeted approach to student recruitment. The results were transformative.

## The Challenge

“Our website was outdated and disorganised, making it difficult to effectively track customer journeys and collect valuable data. Our marketing efforts felt disjointed, with no metrics to support our ideas or track performance. We needed a modern, data-driven platform to help us overcome these challenges,” explains **Victoria Burton, Digital Marketing Officer** at **Queen Ethelburga's Collegiate.**

The school's diverse offerings—from academics to co-curricular activities—made it challenging to showcase everything in a cohesive, user-friendly way. They needed a website that could clearly convey their unique strengths while offering a personalised experience for each prospective student and family.

## The Solution

UBIQ worked closely with Queen Ethelburga’s to develop a modern, intuitive website designed for both aesthetics and performance. A key focus was building a data-rich platform that provided real-time insights into customer behaviour, enabling the school to track and optimise key pages.

"The new website allows us to identify our most popular content and optimise it for better engagement. I can now focus on the pages that matter most, rather than wasting time on content that goes unnoticed. It has made a significant difference in our marketing strategy," said Victoria Burton.

One standout feature was the ability to track customer journeys from initial contact through to enquiry, streamlining the admissions process. “Being able to follow a customer’s full journey after they fill out a form has been invaluable—it has streamlined everything,” Victoria added.

The new site is indexed for over 80% more search terms than before, and the focus on relevant content has led to a 26% increase in clickthrough rates, showcasing enhanced engagement. Organic clicks have increased, driving higher-quality conversions, and we also saw a strong improvement in the average position on Google, indicating that the new indexing is both relevant and high quality.

## The Results

Though it’s still early to assess the full impact, Queen Ethelburga’s has already seen significant improvements in the quality of enquiries. “We’ve noticed a decline in web traffic but an increase in the relevance of visitors. The enquiries we’re receiving now are more targeted and engaged, which is exactly what we were aiming for,” shared Victoria Burton.

Additionally, the new site has proven effective at generating leads, with 600 new contacts created from form submissions with 50+ conversions. The UBIQ Digital Experience Platform (DXP) has captured valuable data from these interactions, providing a wealth of insights into each visitor's journey through the site.

The DXP data reveals that the Senior Prospective audience has been the most engaged over the last six months, particularly those interested in QE Faculty and QE College. There’s also strong engagement from families considering King's Magna and Chapter House, indicating a healthy interest in the full through-school journey. The large international audience is also of crucial importance for QE as a boarding school, and the website is generating valuable leads from these users.

## Collaborative Effort

Queen Ethelburga's credits the seamless collaboration with the UBIQ team as a key element of the project’s success. “Working with Jo, Steve, and Kris felt like a true partnership. They were always eager to brainstorm new ideas and quick to resolve any issues. Steve, in particular, was fantastic—he’s always available and willing to help with even the smallest questions,” remarked Victoria Burton.

The new platform has positioned Queen Ethelburga’s for long-term success by improving lead generation, audience targeting, and engagement.
