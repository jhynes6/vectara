Schools are realizing tremendous value from UBIQ’s cutting-edge digital marketing platform that’s helping them to modernize their school websites while driving success across the campus by providing an exceptional digital experience for families and the entire school community. UBIQ enhances the value of Blackbaud’s Total School Solution while providing schools a compelling choice to manage their school website and digital marketing needs.

Mark Davis, Vice President, Education Products, Blackbaud

Earlier this year, we announced a refreshed partnership with Blackbaud, as we continue to develop and power our native integration. As such, it should be of no surprise, we are taking part in BBCON 2024!

BBCON, Blackbaud's annual customer conference, is just around the corner, and it's shaping up to be the event of the year.

Over the course of three dynamic days, Blackbaud customers nationwide come together for an unparalleled experience filled with sharing, learning, inspiration, and innovation, and we are delighted to be joining the fray.

Whether you're looking to network, stay ahead of the latest industry trends, or be inspired by world-class speakers, BBCon has something for everyone.

This year, we are thrilled to announce that our very own Dan Clarke will be taking the stage to deliver an introduction to UBIQ AMAIS and the power of digital experience platforms! Dan brings decades of industry expertise, and has spearheaded the development of AMAIS which Blackbaud is sure to ignite the room, leaving you with new ideas and perspectives to bring back to your own organisation.

**We can't wait to see you at BBCon—come ready to learn, connect, and be inspired!**
