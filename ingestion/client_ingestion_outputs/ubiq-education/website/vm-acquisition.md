# Acquisition of The Virtual Marketer (VM).

Ubiq Education is delighted to announce as part of its official launch, the acquisition of The Virtual Marketer (VM).

**"Ubiq's acquisition of The Virtual Marketer (VM) demonstrates a clear statement of intent to independent schools and multi-academy trusts around the World who want to become part of the digital elite."
\- Daniel Clarke, CEO.**

The Virtual Marketer will give our clients instant access to a suite of services to help promote and amplify their digital presence. These services will go hand-in-hand with a new platform that is being developed in collaboration with some of the most prestigious schools around the World.

Alta Justus, Founder of The Virtual Marketer echoed those comments adding, "We are delighted to combine forces with Ubiq, which will give our combined client base the opportunity to benefit from a much broader offering across all of their digital marketing efforts, as well as access to a wider team of specialists who can further support them. I'm excited to see the business I started continue to grow so to be able to reach and support even more schools both now and in the future."

#### ABOUT UBIQ.

Ubiq is the brainchild of former School Website founder, Daniel Clarke, whose previous organisation was recognised as the premier provider of websites to schools in the UK and a global force internationally, until sold in 2016.

Daniel Clarke went on to say "Ubiq does not operate within the content management system (CMS) space that other more traditional school website providers choose to occupy. Instead, Ubiq defines a new category entirely, providing schools with an alternate approach, software suite and ecosystem that redefines our clients perception of how their website should perform and what future expectations to have for it. There is no doubt that what Ubiq brings to schools will have a tremendously positive impact on the market and most importantly, give schools another option".
