## Creating a single record of truth

Posted inÂ [Explore](/the-hub)

**In a recent article \[[Unlocking your Insights\]](https://www.ubiqeducation.com/unlocking-your-insights), we've explored the importance of data collection and turning that data into insights. Now, let's dive into the crucial step of unifying this data to create a single, comprehensive view of your prospective families.**

* * *

### The Power of a Unified View

Imagine having a complete picture of every interaction a family has had with your school - from their first website visit to their latest open day attendance. This is the power of a unified data view, often called a "single source of truth" or a "360-degree customer profile".

* * *

### Why is This Important for Independent Schools?

1.  **Personalised Communication**: Understanding a family's complete journey allows you to tailor your communications more effectively, addressing their specific interests and concerns.
2.  **Improved Decision Making**: With a holistic view, you can make more informed decisions about your marketing strategies and admissions processes.
3.  **Enhanced Parent Experience**: By having all information in one place, you can provide a smoother, more consistent experience for prospective families.
4.  **Efficient Resource Allocation**: Understand which touchpoints are most effective in moving families through the admissions funnel, allowing you to allocate resources more efficiently.

* * *

### Challenges in Creating a Unified View

While the benefits are clear, creating a unified view comes with its challenges:

1.  **Data Silos**: Information often resides in different systems - your website analytics, CRM, email marketing platform, etc.
2.  **Data Quality**: Inconsistencies in data format or duplicates can make integration difficult.
3.  **Privacy Concerns**: Ensuring compliance with data protection regulations, especially when dealing with information about children.
4.  **Technical Complexity**: Integrating different systems can be technically challenging.

* * *

### Steps to Create a Unified View

1.  **Identify Data Sources**: List all the places where you collect data about prospective families - website, CRM, event registration systems, etc.
2.  **Create a Common Identifier**: Use a unique identifier (like an email address) to link data from different sources to the same family.
3.  **Standardise Data**: Ensure consistency in how data is formatted across different systems.
4.  **Implement an Integration Solution**: This could be a data warehouse, a customer data platform, or a specialised school management system.
5.  **Ensure Data Quality**: Regularly clean and update your data to maintain accuracy.
6.  **Train Your Team**: Ensure everyone understands the importance of data accuracy and how to use the unified system.

* * *

### Putting the Unified View into Action

Once you have a unified view, you can start leveraging it in your marketing efforts:

*   **Personalised Open Day Invitations**: If you know a family has been researching your science programme online, tailor their open day invitation to highlight your science facilities.
*   **Targeted Follow-ups**: If a family attended an open day but hasn't applied, you can send them personalised information addressing potential concerns.
*   **Predictive Modelling**: Use historical data to predict which families are most likely to enrol, allowing you to focus your efforts more effectively.

**Looking Ahead**

A unified view of your prospective families is more than just a technical achievement - it's a powerful tool for creating more empathetic, effective marketing strategies. By understanding each family's unique journey, you can speak more directly to their hopes, concerns, and aspirations for their child's education.

In our next post, we'll explore how to use this unified view to optimise your marketing efforts through testing and experimentation. Stay tuned!
