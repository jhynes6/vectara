## Frequently Asked  
Questions

**What is a school content management system?**

A school content management system (or CMS) is a web-based software platform. It's designed to facilitate the creation, management, and distribution of a school website's content.

The best school content management systems go further than this though, and serve as a centralized hub for marketing and communications teams to seamlessly organize and collaborate on materials across a whole array of channels.

**What is the difference between a CMS and a DXP?**

A **Content Management System (CMS)** and a **Digital Experience Platform (DXP)** are tools for managing digital content on websites, but they have distinct purposes.

A CMS is primarily aimed at helping you create, manage, and publish content, making it ideal for maintaining web and mobile content. Its key features include content creation and editing tools, publishing functionalities, user management, workflow and version control, and basic website management.

On the other hand, a DXP builds on the capabilities of a CMS to provide comprehensive, personalized digital experiences across multiple channels. It includes additional features such as advanced analytics, personalization engines, marketing automation, e-commerce capabilities, and support for omnichannel experiences. DXPs are designed to manage entire customer journeys, integrating various technologies to deliver seamless experiences across websites, apps, and other digital platforms.

In essence, while a CMS manages content, a DXP uses that content to engage users and personalize their experiences across multiple touchpoints in their journey.

**What sort of customer support and onboarding do you offer?**

Every UBIQ customer receives unparalleled support for the duration of their time with us. Throughout your project we ensure you have the expert help needed from anything from data migration advice, content and UX to a sounding board on design ideas.

Once your website is launched, the customer care doesn't end there. You'll have a seasoned experience director by your side to help you derive insights from your CMS data.

**Does your school website cms support online payments?**

Yes! With the AMAIS content management system, you can accept payments for events via forms, accept online donations, product and merchandise sales, school fee payments, and more. Our secure payment gateway gives you the flexibility needed to help achieve your goals.
