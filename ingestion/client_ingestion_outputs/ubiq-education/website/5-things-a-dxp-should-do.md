## Are you making the most of your data?

5 things a DXP should do.

When it comes to school marketing, we know a DXP (Digital Experience Platform) can be an invaluable tool. If you'd like to learn why, we'd recommend checking out [**this article**](/what-are-digital-experience-platforms-and-why-are-they-important) and then meeting us back here... don't worry, we'll wait.

**Did you give it a read?** Ok, _back to it_!

If your DXP isn’t actively working to attract, nurture, and convert prospective families, then it’s not doing its job. For lots of school marketers, a DXP becomes a nice to have that, unfortunately, gets left unused in a dark corner of your school website somewhere. A great DXP should be more than just a website builder—it should be a powerful tool that uses data to:

* Enhance engagement
* Streamlines processes
* Increase enrolment.

You should be excited about putting your DXP to work, predominantly because it's designed to make it easier for you to get the results you're looking for.

Not sure if your DXP is up to the challenge? **Here are five things a DXP should do to help your school stay ahead.** Feel free to read all of the points, or you can use these buttons to navigate to your area of interest. Happy reading!

### The platform uses personas to build personalized experiences

No two prospective families are the same, so why should their digital experience be?

A strong DXP should allow you to use data to segment your audience into personas—such as local parents, international families, or sixth form applicants—and tailor their experience accordingly.

With UBIQ’s DXP, your website dynamically adjusts content, messaging, and calls to action based on the visitor's persona. This means a prospective international student might see content about visas and boarding, while a local parent sees information on scholarships and open days. The result? A website that speaks directly to the right audience, increasing engagement and inquiries.

Our clients across the globe are taking advantage of personalization which, for many, can be a quick win to draw a prospective family's attention and win the edge over your competitor school.

### Content marketing that actually works

Content is at the heart of any good school marketing strategy, and your DXP should make it easy to create, manage, and distribute it effectively. A modern DXP goes beyond basic content management—it should help you serve the right content at the right time.

UBIQ’s DXP allows you to schedule and personalize blog posts, news articles, and video content based on user behaviour. So, if a visitor has been exploring sports facilities, they might be presented with a blog about your school’s latest sports achievements. By ensuring your content is relevant and timely, you keep prospective families engaged and moving through the decision-making process.

### Automate lead scoring

Not every website visitor is ready to enquire, but your admissions team shouldn’t have to guess who is. A great DXP should include lead scoring—automatically ranking prospective families based on their engagement with your site.

UBIQ’s lead scoring tracks interactions like page visits, downloads, and event sign-ups to determine which families are most likely to take the next step. High-scoring leads can be flagged for immediate follow-up, while lower-scoring leads can be nurtured with targeted content. This data-driven approach means your admissions team can prioritise their efforts where they’ll have the biggest impact.

### Tailored customer journeys

Choosing a school is a major decision, and parents and students don’t make it overnight. Your DXP should help you map out and optimise customer journeys to guide prospective families from their first visit to enrolment.

UBIQ’s DXP tracks the pathways visitors take, helping you identify drop-off points and opportunities to re-engage them. Maybe a parent has attended an open day but hasn’t enquired—your system can trigger an automated email with testimonials from current families. By understanding and shaping these journeys, you can remove friction and increase conversions.

### Drive more conversions

Ultimately, your DXP should help convert interest into action. Whether it’s signing up for an open event, booking a tour, or submitting an enquiry, your platform should be designed to nudge prospective families towards these key moments.

UBIQ’s DXP includes AI-powered insights, dynamic call-to-actions, and personalised landing pages to maximise conversions. It ensures that every website visit is optimised for action, making it easier for families to take the next step.

### Does your digital experience platform do enough?

If your current digital experience platform isn’t delivering on these five essentials, **it might be time for an upgrade**. A DXP should be a strategic asset—one that actively drives engagement, nurtures leads, and increases enrolments.

At UBIQ, we’ve built our DXP specifically for schools, ensuring that every feature is designed to help you achieve your marketing and admissions goals. Want to see it in action? Let’s talk.
