## Done right.

**We think working with your website should be as satisfying as unwrapping your favourite chocolate bar.**

But if youâ€™ve ever banged your head on the desk waiting to resolve a glitch or cringed when your shiny new site looks just like ten others, youâ€™re not alone. UBIQ works to solve all of these problems and more.

# intuitive design

When we launched UBIQ in 2021, it was to do things differently. We saw too many school website providers pushing rigid, cookie-cutter templates that stifle creativity and limit potential. So, we set out to build something betterâ€”a platform that empowers school marketers to unleash their creativity without restrictions.

Every UBIQ website is bespoke, designed to stand out and reflect each schoolâ€™s unique character. Weâ€™re committed to breaking the mold and crafting digital experiences that resonate with your school's unique brand and prospective families.

## Your Audience?

**Onboarding**

During onboarding, our team will give you third-party, objective view of what's working in your marketing strategy, and what's not.

We continue to look at your data throughout your entire contract, with an Experience Director assigned to your school to work with you towards your marketing goalsâ€”because we know how helpful it is to have people in your corner.

**One Source of Truth**

**Too many marketers are spending too many hours trying to figure out their data.**

With UBIQ, our partnering schools are saying goodbye to third-party data apps and reliance on GA4 reporting. The UBIQ AMAIS platform centralises all your data, from source information and personas to behavioural data.

**Before & After Conversion**

**Yepâ€”we can see that you are looking at this page (and all the stuff you've looked at before)â€”spooky, right?**

With UBIQ, schools can see prospective families' journeys before _and_ after converting, enhancing admissions conversations and encouraging meaningful conversations.
