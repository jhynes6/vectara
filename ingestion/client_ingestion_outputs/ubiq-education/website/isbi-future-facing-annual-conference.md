# ISBI’s "Future Facing" Annual Conference 2024

## Get Ready for:

**ISBI'S ANNUAL CONFERENCE 2024!**

**UBIQ to Lead the Way at the ISBI’s "Future Facing" Annual Conference**

**Mark your calendars for:**

#### September 27, 2024!

**UBIQ is proud to be the headline sponsor for this year’s ISBI Annual Conference, themed "Future Facing," happening on Friday, 27th September 2024.**

This highly anticipated event serves as an incubator for networking, workshops, and inspiring keynote speakers, all designed to equip attendees with the tools and insights needed to lead your school into the future. The ISBI Annual Conference is not just another event—it’s a forum where Senior Leaders, alongside Marketing, Admissions, and Advancement professionals, come together to share best practices, case studies, innovative ideas, and actionable advice.

**The goal?** To make schools more outward-looking, honest, open, and courageous, while championing the needs of future-facing parents, children, and staff.

We’re also excited to announce that UBIQ’s Sales Director, Daryll Middleton, will be among the workshop speakers. With over 13 years of experience in the education sector, Daryll’s journey started at School Website and led to founding Teacheroo, the UK’s largest education job network. Now back in the world of school websites, his combined commercial and educational insights help schools exceed audience expectations.

**Workshop Title: The Future of School Web Experiences: Exceed Audience Expectations**

Brendan Rodgers, UBIQ’s Marketing Director, will also present at the conference. With nearly 15 years of experience, Brendan has worked with brands like Adobe, Intel, and eBay, as well as startups and nonprofits such as Nerve Tumours UK. He is now focused on elevating school marketing and personalising experiences for parents and children.

**Workshop Title: Atomic Content Strategies for School Teams**

Joining them will be industry experts **Rachel Henshilwood, Rachell Fox, Tom Rogerson, Helen Lewis-McPhee, Claire Bath,** and **Geoff Ramm**, who will lead sessions designed to inspire, challenge, and provide actionable strategies for schools.

Mark your calendar for **Friday, 27th September 2024**, and join us at the ISBI Annual Conference for a day of learning, collaboration, and inspiration.

**Let’s face the future together, with courage and confidence!**
