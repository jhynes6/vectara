School Websites

Since 2021, **UBIQ Education** has been building **tailor-made, data-driven** websites for forward-thinking private schools across the globe.

**Stunning Websites. Designed with Purpose. Powered by Data.**

Behind every UBIQ website, there is UBIQ AMAIS™, our one-of-a-kind marketing platform built from powerful technology. Put simply, AMAIS™ is a market-leading marketing ecosystem which enables schools to simplify the management of their entire marketing output.

Our global school partners are leveraging first-party data to track visitor behaviour in real time, trigger personalized content, and automate marketing workflows—giving them the insight they need to make smarter decisions and achieve measurable results.

## Our Story  
The UBIQ Story

**Since 2002**, our team has launched over 1,000 school websites worldwide. In 2021, UBIQ Education set out to deliver unique and creative digital experiences, specifically for schools, backed by modern, cutting-edge technology. Today, we partner with leading institutions like The Episcopal School of Dallas, Repton, and Sharjah English School.

Since launching, UBIQ has quickly grown to become the leading provider of modern solutions to the school marketing space, and has no plans to slow down.

### UBIQ Education  
Dare to be Different

**The Problem**  
**School websites are commonly built solely on CMS platforms, limiting the efficiency and effectiveness of school marketing teams.**  
Modern private schools are facing an increasingly competitive market. These teams are expected to make informed decisions when planning strategies with very little understanding of their prospective families.

**The Solution**  
**Building an all-in-one marketing ecosystem.**  
The UBIQ AMAIS™ platform includes a CMS purposefully designed for school marketers, but this is just one small piece of the puzzle.

AMAIS is a complete marketing solution powered by first-party data, created with the purpose of simplifying the management of your website, optimising your internal processes and delivering features you’ve never seen before on school websites.

### WHY UBIQ?

**Our creative website solutions are powered by a next-generation website and data platform.**  
We enable schools to create dynamic, personalized websites that drive inquiries, engagement, and enrolment.

**LET'S CHAT**

## Innovation

Our platform provides audience insight on an unprecedented scale and at an unrivaled level of detail. The better we understand your audiences, the greater the connection we can make. We fuse data science and content strategy with storytelling.

**This is why no two UBIQ websites are ever the same.**
