# Philosophy | Websites For Schools | UBIQ Education | Daring To Be Different

## It's time for change

**Our Mission is to deliver to our schools unique and creative digital experiences, backed by cutting-edge data platforms alongside first-class customer service.**

## Done

**Done with cookie-cutter creatives pumped out of the same old templates. Done with clunky hard to use content management systems. Done with school web design agencies that think data is only for geeks.**

Not only will we make sure you understand your audiences, but we will work tirelessly alongside you to grow your enrolment, recruitment and fundraising so you can meet your goals. because your success matters.

## Digital Experiences

**We’ve been making websites for schools since 2002.** A few things have changed along the way; how we talk about websites and content, - even how we position ourselves.

What hasn’t changed? Our **commitment** to creating the best websites for schools and a long-standing promise to work with you in partnership.

## Our Promises

## To You...

**We do not, and will not charge for every little change.**

We know that constant upselling puts a huge budgetary strain on you and your team - and frankly, on our relationship. We don’t do it.

**We honour your values, heritage and faith.**

We know it is an emotional choice for parents to choose a school. This is why we root our designs in your values, heritage, and faith to ensure your school is truly celebrated.

**We continually invest into AMAIS capabilities.**

We believe in constant innovation and iteration, and we will constantly grow the capabilities, security and power of AMAIS for you and your school.

**We partner with the best of EdTech for you.**

We build our relationships with major EdTech providers to support your existing tech stack, enabling AMAIS to fit naturally in with your prior investments.

## Creative Partners

**We’re in. Are you?**

Once your website is live - that is not the end - in-fact it’s just the beginning. You will work in partnership with a dedicated Experience Director, who has your back and will support you with data reports, content, training support and more.

## Build for the future

**We help forward-thinking schools around the world deliver the right message, over the right medium, at the right moment.**
