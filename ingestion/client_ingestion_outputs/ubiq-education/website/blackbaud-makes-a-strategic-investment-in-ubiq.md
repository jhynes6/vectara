**Charleston, S.C. (May 8, 2024) — [Blackbaud](https://www.blackbaud.com/) (NASDAQ: BLKB), the leading provider of software for powering social impact, today announced a strategic investment in [UBIQ Education](https://ubiqeducation.com/), innovators in school websites through the introduction of AMAIS, the first digital experience ecosystem (DXE) for schools.**

* * *

The £4 million ($5 million) investment in UBIQ demonstrates Blackbaud’s commitment to supporting K-12 private schools in being able to effectively seek, identify and cultivate the right families for their community—supporting all aspects of their online admissions, fundraising, recruitment, and inclusion initiatives.

The focus of the investment will be on delivering a native integration, extending Blackbaud’s Total School Solution to include UBIQ’s AMAIS platform, giving Blackbaud customers direct access to a cutting-edge suite of marketing and admissions tools with seamless data integration across the platform. This investment gives Blackbaud customers the ability to leverage UBIQ’s immensely powerful first-party AI and ML data platform and strategically positions UBIQ as Blackbaud’s premier partner in the delivery of website solutions.

Blackbaud will continue to deliver its own solution, Blackbaud School Website System, as an integrated product within its education portfolio. By partnering with UBIQ to deliver an integration with Blackbaud’s products, Blackbaud is offering schools an upgrade option that provides enhanced digital marketing capabilities, without losing out on the power of a connected system enabled through Blackbaud’s **[Total School Solution](https://www.blackbaud.com/who-we-serve/k-12-schools)**.

UBIQ was founded in 2021 with the objective of completely transforming every aspect of how a school website could be created, curated and managed. The company’s over-arching mission is to democratize data for the marketing, admissions and advancement departments while facilitating data-driven decisions that yield better outcomes.

In a very short space of time, UBIQ has partnered with many of the most prestigious and significant schools in the world.  
Mark Davis, vice president, education products, Blackbaud

**_“These schools are realizing tremendous value from UBIQ’s cutting-edge digital marketing platform that’s helping them to modernize their school websites while driving success across the campus by providing an exceptional digital experience for families and the entire school community. UBIQ enhances the value of Blackbaud’s Total School Solution while providing schools a compelling choice to manage their school website and digital marketing needs.”_**

**_“It is no coincidence that many of these forward-thinking schools are Blackbaud customers, so it makes total sense to bring both companies closer together through a strategic investment, partnership and integration of this nature,”_** said Daniel Clarke, CEO and founder of UBIQ. _**“I am excited to see what this collaboration will bring to provide even more value to our customers.”**_

Blackbaud and UBIQ have already delivered an initial round of integration whereby UBIQ-powered schools can seamlessly pull athletics and directory data automatically from Blackbaud Student Information System™.

With this investment, Blackbaud will continue to work closely with UBIQ to modernize the admissions process by empowering Blackbaud Enrollment Management System™ with UBIQ's DXE to enhance the experience with personalized digital content and automated inquiries, allowing schools to build stronger relationships as they direct families through admissions and enrollment.  
Ken Hyde, Assistant Head of School for Enrollment Management and Parent Relations at Porter-Gaud School, shared, _**“By moving our website to UBIQ, Porter-Gaud is seeking to deliver a best-in-class, flagship experience that personalizes the experience for all families and connects their interests with what the school can provide for their children. We are excited to see how Blackbaud and UBIQ working together will help us exceed our school’s strategic goals while providing a powerful and unique experience to our school’s community.”**_
