Conferences are a great opportunity for marketing and admissions professionals to connect with peers within the school community.  
It's also the perfect time to meet leaders in the education space and discover new methodologies and technologies designed with your success in mind.

If you're attending either of the upcoming events and would  
like to chat with a member of the team to learn how our AMAISTM platform can revolutionise the way you work,  
we'd love to hear from you!
