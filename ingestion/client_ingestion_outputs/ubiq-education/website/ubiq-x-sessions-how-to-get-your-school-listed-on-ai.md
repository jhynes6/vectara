# How Private Schools Can  
Get Listed on AI

##### Webinar: 28th August 2025

**Date Published:** Friday 29th August 2025

Search is changing, and fast. For years, schools have _poured_ energy into climbing Google rankings. But, with Google's dramatic loss of market share and the rise of generative AI, parents are now just as likely to ask ChatGPT _“What’s the best school near me?”_ as they are to type it into Google.

This shift is both exciting and unsettling for school marketers around the world. It can be exciting, because it opens new doors for schools to be discovered. It's also unsettling, because AI doesn’t just read your website, it reads _everything_. If your school isn’t showing up in AI-generated answers, you risk disappearing from the very place where prospective families are making decisions.

That’s why, on **Thursday 28 August**, we hosted a special webinar, _Get Listed on AI_, with **Maddie Lingard, Head of Marketing at UBIQ**, and **Brendan Schneider, Founder of SchneiderB Media**. Together, we unpacked what AI means for school search and shared practical steps schools can take right now.

Here are five ways schools can win in the new search era, paired with short videos you can watch and share with your team.

### What is Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) and why does it matter for schools?

Traditional SEO is about ranking for keywords on Google. GEO, or Generative Engine Optimization, is about being selected by AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Perplexity when they generate answers.

*   **SEO = crawlers ranking pages.**
*   **GEO = AI synthesising and recommending schools.**

If parents ask, _“Best private schools in Pittsburgh?”_ SEO helps you rank on Google. GEO helps you appear directly in ChatGPT’s list. You need both. In the above video, Brendan explains GEO vs SEO, breaking down how AI search differs from traditional search.

### How do I check if my school is already showing up in AI search?

Many schools don’t realise they can already see if AI tools are sending traffic.

1.  Log into Google Analytics.
2.  Go to **Reports > Acquisition > Traffic acquisition**.
3.  Change the setting to **Session source/medium**.
4.  Scan for entries like “chatgpt.com / referral” or “perplexity.ai / referral.”

If you see them, congratulations, AI is finding you. If not, it’s time to act. In the above clip, Brendan walks through using Google Analytics to track referrals from ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, etc.

### What kinds of questions do parents ask AI about schools?

Parents aren’t typing short phrases. They’re asking _specific_ long-tail questions:

*   “Best school for sports in London”
*   “Which schools in Texas have strong STEM programs?”
*   “Top Montessori schools in Dubai”

To show up, schools need to write conversational content that directly answers these long-tail queries. Forget keyword stuffing (we've all been guilty of that at one point or another). Write as though you’re answering a parent over coffee.

### Where should schools be mentioned online to appear in AI results?

AI reads beyond your website to make a decision. It scans forums, reviews, directories, and articles. That means your reputation on platforms like Mumsnet, Good Schools Guide, or expat forums really matters.

Encourage parents, alumni, and even local press to talk about your school. These “digital breadcrumbs” help AI build a stronger picture of your school’s credibility.

### Should schools be bolder when writing about themselves for AI?

Many schools shy away from bold statements, preferring soft phrases. But AI rewards clarity and specificity.

Parents search for “best schools,” so if you’re not confident in your positioning, you won’t appear. The takeaway? Be authentic, but don’t be afraid to say you’re the best—in the areas you genuinely excel.

### Final Thoughts

AI search isn’t a fad and it's here to stay. So, it's integral that schools consider how they will capitalize from this dramatic shift in consumer behaviour. By 2027, AI-driven queries are predicted to overtake traditional search. Schools that act now, optimising content, encouraging external mentions, and getting comfortable with GEO, will stay ahead of the curve.

### Frequently Asked Questions

What is GEO and how is it different from SEO?

GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) is about optimising your digital presence so your school appears in AI-generated answers from tools like ChatGPT or Gemini. SEO, on the other hand, focuses on ranking in traditional search engines like Google. You now need both.

How can I check if my school already shows up in AI search?

Look at your Google Analytics under _Reports > Acquisition > Traffic acquisition > Session source/medium_. If you see referrals from sites like [chatgpt.com](http://chatgpt.com) or [perplexity.ai](http://perplexity.ai), it means families are already finding you through AI search.

What types of questions do parents ask AI about schools?

Parents tend to ask long-tail, conversational queries such as:

*   “Best school for STEM in Austin”
*   “Which schools in Dubai offer the IB curriculum?”
*   “Best school for sports in London”  
    Creating content that directly answers these questions increases your chance of being featured.

Do mentions outside our website really make a difference?

Yes. AI pulls from the entire web, not just your site. Parent forums, alumni reviews, press coverage, and directories all strengthen your digital footprint and increase your likelihood of appearing in results.

Are videos considered content by AI search?

Yes — but transcripts and captions matter most. AI tools can’t interpret raw visuals, so providing context through text (subtitles, descriptions, structured metadata) ensures your video content is recognised.

Why does AI often list public schools first?

AI reflects the data it’s trained on. Public schools often have more widely available information online, which means they surface more easily. However, independent schools can compete by publishing clear, specific content and encouraging third-party mentions.

Should our school be bold and call itself “the best”?

You don’t need to exaggerate, but clarity and confidence matter. Parents search for “best schools,” so if your content avoids those terms entirely, you may miss out. A good balance is to be factual, specific, and bold about your genuine strengths.
