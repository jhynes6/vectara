Previously, Daniel Clarke served as the CEO & Founder of School Website, which was successfully sold in December 2016, being acquired by Finalsite. Since then, Daniel has been actively involved in various advisory boards in a non-executive capacity and has invested in early-stage companies. He also serves as a mentor to several CEOs. In 2022, he founded Ubiq with the mission to challenge conventional approaches to school marketing and communication. Ubiq encourages innovative thinking while emphasizing the importance of data-driven technology and a focus on achieving superior outcomes.

We are thankful for Ubiq's support of Elevate and their exclusive sponsorship at Elevate 2024 in Nashville.
