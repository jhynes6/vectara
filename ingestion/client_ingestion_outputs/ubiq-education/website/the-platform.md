# Introducing the first digital experience ecosystem for schools

The **AMAIS™ DXE** (Advanced Marketing AI System Digital Experience platform) takes the best-of-breed tools from asset management, content management, and digital experience - combining them into a single easy-to-use platform. Harnessing the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI), **AMAIS™** transforms data into insights, delivers personalised experiences, optimises the journey, delights visitors, and increases conversions.

## What does AMAIS™ platform Include?

### Digital asset management

**AMAIS™** creates a centralised system for your school to organise and access media assets, improve efficiency, and control brand data. Streamline your branding and marketing efforts by tagging and tracking assets.

---

### Content management

AMAIS™ enables schools to manage digital content all in one place. Easily create and update responsive webpages, content blocks, banner images, galleries, forms, social mashups, calendars, and more.

---

### Real-time personalisation

AMAIS™ has the power to personalise content in real-time for your visitors. By analysing your visitor characteristics and behaviours as they navigate your site, the solution will serve relevant content most likely to convert.

---

### Analytics & optimisation

AMAIS™ turns data into insight, tracking each user's journey to understand how they interact with your content. This makes it easy to optimise content and make incremental changes to increase conversions.

---

### Omnichannel experiences

AMAIS™ makes it easy to share your digital content across other channels and systems outside of your website. Technically speaking, unlike the traditional CMS, this "headless" platform separates the content repository (body) from the presentation layer (head), so it can be accessed and shared via API.

## Build for the future

**We help forward-thinking schools around the world deliver the right message, over the right medium, at the right moment.**
