**Beyond Expectations: The Dunham School's Digital Transformation with UBIQ.**
How a tailored approach and first-party data insights are elevating The Dunham School's marketing, recruitment and engagement strategies.

Posted in [Explore](/the-hub)

### Overview

**The Dunham School** is a leading independent, co-educational institution in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, offering a comprehensive college preparatory education from preschool through to Year 13. With a focus on academic excellence, spiritual development, and community values, Dunham fosters a nurturing environment where students are encouraged to reach their full potential both inside and outside the classroom.

### The Challenge

Dunham sought to stand out in a competitive market by authentically connecting with prospective families and showcasing what makes their school unique. They needed a digital platform that not only served as a functional website but truly reflected who they are as a school. The goal was to create an online presence that resonated with their values and mission, offering a personalised experience that would attract and engage families on a deeper level.

### The Solution

"UBIQ took the time to fully understand what makes Dunham special, listening carefully to our needs and translating that insight into a website that truly reflects who we are. The outcome is not merely a functional platform, but a bespoke, beautifully crafted digital space that allows us to stand out in a competitive market."

"By tailoring the site to align with our story and values, UBIQ has given us the tools to connect authentically with prospective families, showcasing what makes our school unique."

One of the most impactful elements of this collaboration has been UBIQ’s ability to leverage the power of first-party data insights through the AMAIS platform. “These insights have revolutionized our marketing approach by enabling us to create more personalized connections with prospective families, which has allowed us to foster meaningful relationships in ways we previously couldn’t.”

“Working with UBIQ has been an exceptional experience that has far surpassed our expectations,” **\- Marguerite Estes.**

### The Results

The initial reporting provided by UBIQ’s Digital Experience Platform (DXP) revealed key opportunities to elevate the user experience even further. Through data-driven insights, it became clear that offering content tailored specifically to different age cohorts would greatly enhance how families interact with the site. In response, Dunham has since developed new pages and documents that allow prospective families to explore programming and curriculum information specifically relevant to their child’s age group.

These enhancements go beyond simply improving user navigation—they demonstrate a deeper level of personalization that resonates with our audience. By aligning digital content more closely with the needs and expectations of prospective families, we’ve not only strengthened the overall user experience but have also empowered our team with richer, more actionable data.

Through this enriched data, Dunham can now gain a more precise understanding of who is visiting the site, what content they engage with, and how best to adapt our marketing strategies. This enhanced level of personalization has positioned us to make more informed, strategic decisions, ensuring that we can continue to build meaningful relationships with prospective families.

With the site having only gone live a few months prior to this posting, Dunham School's ongoing use of the platform will provide deeper, more detailed data, allowing them to strengthen and maintain meaningful relationships with prospective families. As these results evolve, we’ll continue to provide updates here.

### Collaborative Effort

“Working with UBIQ has been an exceptional experience that has far surpassed our expectations.” Marguerite Estes, Director of Marketing & Communications at The Dunham School, shared that from the initial information-gathering phase through to the design, development, and final launch, the UBIQ team approached our web project as more than just a client service—they treated it as a true partnership. Their commitment to understanding our school, its unique mission, and culture was evident at every stage.

> ‘’We are incredibly excited about where this partnership will lead and the long-term impact UBIQ will have on our marketing, recruitment, and engagement efforts. The future looks brighter than ever, thanks to UBIQ's innovative solutions and ongoing collaboration.’’ **\- MARGUERITE ESTES**
