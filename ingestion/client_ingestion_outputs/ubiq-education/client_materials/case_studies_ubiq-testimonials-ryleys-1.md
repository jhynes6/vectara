Tailored Deliverables
In one of our fastest-delivered projects to-date,
UBIQ delivered a full website redesign in time for
The Ryleys School’s admission timeline.

The redesign created a sophisticated look and
feel, adding vibrancy to its identity as an
independent school.

We updated brand elements, hosted
photoshoots, and built child-centric creatives to
deliver a sky-is-the-limit sense of adventure for the
pupils of the school.

Amazing Results

Parents now actively praise the school for the
site update, easy-to-find information, and
navigation.

By creating a clear, simple and informative user
experience we were able to increase conversions
by 140%.

The school has already seen a 15% year-on-year
uptick in their admissions since the launch of their
new site!

Margaret Harris,
Admissions, Marketing & Communications @ The Ryleys School

Not only have we had positive feedback from
new applicants about the design of our site,
it’s ease of use and creative style, but our
current parents and job applicants find it easy
to use too.

I feel that UBIQ just wants our business to
grow and get better. That's the difference.

Margaret Harris,
Admissions, Marketing & Communications @ The Ryleys School

We are thrilled with the significant progress
we have made with our business intelligence
and website performance.

Yeah, we think 15% increase in admissions a
year and half is pretty good!

Supportive Data Guidence

Post-launch, The Ryleys School and their UBIQ
Experience Director, Steve, worked closely
together to understand the website
performance and to identify new growth
opportunities.

Reviewing data each month together identified
areas that challenged the School's
understanding of their audience, and allowed
them to make informed, strategic changes to
their approaches!

Strategic Successes

Seeing such insights clearly expressed through data
justified a shift in focus in wider marketing
activities by the School, with a new confidence to
invest.

Together we developed holistic approaches to
maximise acquisition of relevant traffic to the
website. The successful (and ongoing)
SEO/Organic Search strategy is still paying
dividends with increased exposure in non-brand
search, visits to the website, and new enquiries.

Margaret Harris,
Admissions, Marketing & Communications @ The Ryleys School

The company that we had before didn't have
or didn't give us access to data. We as a
team had no knowledge on website analytics.

Now, I get my monthly report from UBIQ and
if my Experience Director has seen some
change in the numbers, he knows why.

Margaret Harris,
Admissions, Marketing & Communications @ The Ryleys School

We continue to work closely on a weekly
basis to fine tune and finesse our website.

We now have significantly more confidence
and control over the content and
effectiveness of our website and our digital
strategy.

Thank you, UBIQ!
