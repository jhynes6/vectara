WLD 2021 Strategy Draft

Part 2bi: Client Profiles

* + - 1. Agencies
         1. Agency 1: Traditional Dinosaur - A1 is a “traditional” marketing/ad agency that is losing current clients and pitches because they have not caught up with the demand for digital-centric executions. (agencies with zero digital in house are becoming rarer)
         2. Agency 2: Full-Service Faker - A2 is a “traditional” marketing/ad agency that does “diet” digital: some social, and search, but the rest is not truly digital (– seo, content, design, etc). They need to expand their capabilities with vendors (and may already have done so- but could be looking to consolidate digital vendors OR always looking for a better deal/more sparkly tools in the toolbelt)
         3. Agency 3: “Digital” Dale - A3 calls themselves a digital agency but in reality is really a web design, seo, and graphic design house. They want to start adding digital ad execution to their offerings to get a piece of the pie, as opposed to referring their clients to ad agencies once their web and design work is done.
         4. Agency 4: DSP Need – Agency 4 is a 360 or digital agency and all they want is someone to execute the DSP/”programmatic” portion of their campaigns. They have no interest in hearing about any other offerings- they have come to the table because they don’t want jump through the many hoops and costs to onboard a DSP in house. This client is typically very low touch- just submits orders with impression minimums, targeting parameters, and reporting requests
         5. Agency 5: Bandwidth Bandit - A5 has all the tools needed manage their own campaigns but is lacking the bandwidth. A5 is very savvy,

deliberate, and specific with what they want. A5 will typically request WLD to run ongoing evergreen campaigns running with WLD, have WLD on the backburner for high traffic months or bandwidth pickles, or both.

Agency 6: Specialty Sally: A6 is an agency specializing in a specific industry – for example automotive. A6 is attracted to scalable shiny tactics/products that they can add to their offerings.

* + - * 1. Agency 6: CTV Cindy – (new addition) – AF6 is looking for a one stop shop CTV vendor that can deliver a media mix of publishers and networks in one buy instead of knocking on each door and dealing with minimums and multiple relationships (LB note: new addition, I want to try to product this up as a separate effort – ongoing project – not fully baked)
