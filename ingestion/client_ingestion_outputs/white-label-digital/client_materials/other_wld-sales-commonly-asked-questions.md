WLD Sales – Commonly Asked Questions

*Please send me your fees/costs / What are your prices?:*

Our fees are baked into the media budget for each campaign, at a level determined based on complexity & # of channels, typically 20-30%. This includes everything from strategy and planning, to tracking implementation and campaign launch, optimization, reporting, and everything in between.

We do not charge any extra incremental fees for planning, set up, hours banks, tracking & attribution, reporting customization, creative refreshes, landing page testing, white labeled client facing support on pitching/reporting calls, etc.

If a campaign does not come to fruition, we consider it cost of doing business, as we do not want to deter our partners or potential partners from bringing us into the fold early in your planning process (one of our big differentiators). As a result, and time our team spends plans/proposals on our side is a loss for us if the campaign does not run, and you do not incur fees.

*(only if they are asking for packages, or ask “how much does a ppc campaign cost”, include below)*

If you are looking for packages or a-la-carte options for your clients, we can connect to put together some custom options for you, but we don’t have cookie-cutter packages ready on the shelf as there are many variables that determine an appropriate budget level for each client’s campaign (objective, product/service, service area/geographic target, etc)

*What are your minimums?*

Due to our streamlined cost model (as outlined above), we typically need our agency partners to spend at least $20k per month cumulatively across their clients for the relationship to make sense.  (If there is potential but they seem smaller, I add “However it is fine to start smaller for the first campaign, or work up to that”)

But because we don’t have a retainer or partnership fee you can use us as needed.

*(Basically the point here is to avoid agencies that have a small handful of 500-1000 per month campaigns - which is very common)*

*\*How do I (agency owner) make money off of the business we send you?*

Typically, you would add an external management fee, or increase your retainer to account for some sort of digital campaign management fee. A common level our other partners use is an additional 20%, but as its outside of our purview its completely up to you, and not something we see.

So, for example if the campaign budget is $10k, our fees are baked and the $10k is what shows in reporting as ad spend and what we invoice you. Your fee would be a separate line item on your scope of work to your client, along with any other services you are providing.

We can also bake your fee into the ad spend as well, just keep in mind that will inflate metrics.

*What’s the process if we get started/ how long does it take for a campaign to go live?*

We have a very fast turnaround; we can go live as quickly as you provide as the info and assets we need. But typically, this is the process:

* You provide us the initial info we need around your client or fill out our short [new campaign brief](https://forms.gle/FWdHMmNya861AjWd9)
* We return a media plan in 2 biz days (can be sooner depending on complexity)
* Once plan is approved:
  + We send 1 container tag for you to place on client’s site (then we do all tracking set up on our end)
  + You provide creative assets for QA (specs will have been previously provided) and any available first party data
  + You/your client provide any access needed (which is minimal/depends on channels chosen as we run everything in our own ad accounts). Any access points are white labeled – ex/ meta advertising access and google analytics access
* Launch
* Reporting dashboard set up & access
* Subsequent status updates and insights deliveries

*Scenario – running in agency’s account or end client’s account, explaining why we don’t*

Our system was designed in a way that the data from the campaigns we run flow from our master accounts into our data stack, which feeds our proprietary optimization alert system and most importantly our custom reporting dashboards that consolidate and format data from our many platforms.

*(The above is typically enough that they are fine with it but were just wondering, but below goes into other supporting reasoning)*

* Client owned accounts often lead intermittent campaign shut offs due to credit card issues out of our control
* We can’t guarantee results if others have the access to make edits and change our set ups, either intentionally or non-intentionally
* Our platform specific structuring, bid settings, custom audiences, and more are our proprietary practices/intellectual property and running in clients’ accounts does not protect us from clients requesting our services for expert set up then terminating our relationship

\*\*\*There are very very rare exceptions where we will manage in someone else’s account but must be a robust budget (6 figure?) and would be a custom set up situation, some qualifiers below:

* *If the budget is big enough that a smaller % fee covers of****and/or****if there is a high likelihood they will run other channels that have to be in our accounts (ex/CTV) - we say yes*
* *If it's a small budget but the agency partner has already brought us a lot of other high budget work and its favor/partner type exercise, and can be low touch  - we say yes*
* *Gets us in the door with a new agency partner where this wouldn't be the norm - we say yes*
* *Relationship based*
* *Then if it's just not a good fit into the above situations and no potential around that client or agency for other more profitable stuff we say no*
* *Sometimes a compromise is (also if its a bandwidth issue) we help get it setup and give a big write up of recos for our agency partner if they have someone in house that can give it a whirl and come to us for questions*

*Do you do creative assets, SEO, email marketing, etc.*

No, at this time our offerings solely focus on paid digital advertisings execution, but for creative asset design we have partners we can refer you to or add on to our services. (However, we can write copy for you)

\*\*Also, outside of video ads, the creative best practice has moved towards image style assets used in dynamic assets, so if you don’t have design access or don’t want to work it into budget, we can run full and successful display, social, and search campaigns with no design needed at all, simply imagery and copy (we write copy for you)

*Do you do make landing pages?*

Yes, we can create simple landinh pages, and make and test

*Where are you located / how big is your team?*

Our home base is in Charlotte NC, but we also have team members in Vermont, Atlanta, Kansas City, and the Chicago area.  We have a team of 5 strategists and project managers, then the meat of our team are our 7 ad ops specialists, all have at least 10 years of hands-on campaign management experience.   *(Depending on scenario/person, can get into that our head of ad ops formerly ran all ad spend for lending tree etc…)*

*(when there are questions on capacity/campaign size)* - Our direct DSP seats give us unlimited ad spend capacity, we can run millions of dollars in ad spend per month
