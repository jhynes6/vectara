Hi X,

White Label Digital can plug into your agency to expand your digital offerings or fill one off needs to specific clients (all while white-labeled behind your agency).

We are a 100% in-house, US based team and execute all campaigns within our own ad platforms and DSP seats, with no contracts, retainers, set-up or customization fees.

We also have a white-labeled reporting dashboard included with all campaigns.

Channels

* Programmatic Display, Video, Audio, & CTV/OTT
* Paid Search
* Paid Social

Targeting Tactics (including but not limited to):

* Third party audience data
* First party data - matchback and lookalike
* Dynamic retargeting
* Purchase behavior & intent
* Demographic. interest, & family structure
* Hyper-local

Attached is a sheeter with more info- or you can check out our [website](https://whitelabeldigital.co/), let me know if you are interested!

Thanks,

Lizzy

Shorter/follow up blurbs:

It looks like we could provide a few solutions for both [agency name] and your clients

* Expand your paid digital capabilities beyond paid search and paid social
* Consolidate # vendors for your clients (WLD would be completely white labeled behind X)
* Streamline reporting & communication for your clients by putting all of their digital under one roof
* Fulfill one-off client requests quickly that you currently could not otherwise fulfill in house

White Label Digital can plug into any agency, even a digital agency to provide added value for you and your clients (all while being white labeled) including:

* Expanded digital capabilities and offerings, filling any holes you may have
* Consolidation of vendors and reporting
* Streamlined reporting and communication
* Fulfillment of one-off client requests that cannot be executed in house

Used for background when someone asks for more info:

*We are a digital advertising agency that plugs in, or white labels behind other agencies to act as their in house digital advertising department from strategy and planning, to campaign execution, fulfillment, management & optimization, and reporting with an online dashboard.*

*We execute digital ads across all paid platforms including paid search, paid social, display, video, Connected TV/OTT, and streaming audio ads.*

*Our fees are baked into the media budget for each campaign, at a level determined based on complexity & # of channels (edit- depending on situation I say here “typically about 20-30%”. We do not charge any extra incremental fees for planning, set up, hours, reporting customization, whitelisted client facing support on pitching/reporting calls, etc.*

*If you're still interested please book a time with me here and we can chat.*

Subject line: Catch up: Accessible CTV Ads

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| |  |  | | --- | --- | | |  | | --- | | Hi ${Leads.First Name},  We have made some huge strides in our Connected TV offerings that we wanted to share.

However we have direct seats inside demand-side-platforms (DSPs), meaning we execute multi-network/publisher buys within a single campaign and budget, without subjecting you and your clients to unrealistic minimums.  Some benefits of our CTV offering below:   * Advanced targeted down to demographic, behavior, purchase history & intent, and content genre * No locked in contracts * No barriers to entry * Agility to modify campaigns quickly in flight * 98% completion rate * Control over who sees your ads & how often * Isolation of big-screen-only placements   Please take a look at the attached sheeter and let me know if you are interested!  Thank you, | | |
