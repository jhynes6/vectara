do it well, and do it right.

Email is a wide-net mechanism to both capture and generate
demand for your offering.  Email is the #1 channel for new client
acquisiton for 10,000s of companies from SMBs to the Fortune 500.

EmailVolumeThe name of the game with email is delivering high-quality,targeted messages to your buyers - at scale. Positive reply ratesare only 1% to 0.1% - hence high-volume is critical to success.TestingWith volume comes the ability to aggressively split test acrossdozens of parameters: industry, persona, offer, company size, etc. “Always On”At scale outbound email is designed to be an “Always On”marketing channel.  Regardless of your market size, we can alwaysbe testing, re-targetting and getting feedback from the market.With proper volume, testing and targeting - cold email drivesover 1000 sales calls/month onto our customer’s calendars.Successful clients recieve anywhere from 4-40+ calls/monthwith degrees of vetting, specificity and sales intent.  CRM IntegrationNo lead or sales opportunity goes to waste with a proper CRMsetup and integration. Our team has worked with dozens ofCRMs to ensure efficient and loss-less data management.Results

Direct Dialing is a focused, higher conversion rate mechanism to
identify, qualify and engage with high-priority buyers in your market.
One of the oldest channels for sales teams - many have moved
away from cold-calling in favor of “easier” channels... But we do what
works, not what is easy and Direct Dialing WORKS!

Dialing/Cold CallingTeam + TrainingOur team is 100% full-time and based in South Africa - collegeeducated and native english speaking. Each team member is from theSDR industry and works on the MintLeads offer for 1 month, minimum.QualificationIf you need highly qualified leads for a niche offering - onlydialing can achieve the vetting you need in your sales process.ResultsDialing is a much more predictable input-output machine thanany other outbound channel. If your product is needed in themarket, we can consistently generate leads and hit sales targets.Scaling CapabilitiesOur team of dialers can quickly scale to meet your needs.  Wecan deploy upto 5 total, full-time employees to your account inas little as 2 weeks.  We always carry and train additionalresources - they are trained and work on dialing for MintLeadswhen they are not assigned to client accounts!VolumeWhile only targetting 1/6 to 1/3 as many targets as with our basic emailplans - dialing has a 3-6X higher penetraton rate into your market.This is an ideal mechanism if you have a small number of targets.
