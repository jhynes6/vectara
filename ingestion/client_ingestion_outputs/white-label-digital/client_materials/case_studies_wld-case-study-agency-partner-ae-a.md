Agency Partner
Case Study.

Use-Case:
Arthur Elliott
Marketing
Group

1.   Stafﬁng Issues

3.    Finding the Best Digital Tactics

“Not only did we struggle to
understand who to hire and what
experience we needed, we didn’t know
where to begin ﬁnding those people.
White Label Digital uses full-time,
US-based staff that’s experienced
and trained, ready to get to work.”

“Client success is the only thing that
matters to us at Arthur Elliott. White
Label helped us improve our digital
products and practices, delivering
more successful outcomes from paid
ad campaigns and happier clients.
The fact that we saved time and
money while improving our offering to
clients, is an added bonus!”

2.   Limited Time & Resources

4.    You Don’t Know What You Don’t Know

“Recruiters and technology are
expensive, and the time it takes to
manage both of those moving pieces
can be even more expensive. White
Label lets me avoid these costs, while
still lending me the people and
technology that I need, when I need
it, at no extra cost to me.”

“White Label staffs expertise beyond
what I need, and they’re always looking
at new and different ways to execute
paid ad campaigns, so I know that I’m
covered and I don’t have to worry
about the expense or management of
that staff.”

Typical areas of expertise required to
execute successful and meaningful
paid AD campaigns:

1.    Data

salary.com avg: $128,000

API connectivity, data ingestion &
storage, reporting and data analysis.

2.    Digital Account Manager & Strategist

Manager | salary.com avg: $105,000
Strategist | salary.com avg: $117,000

Forecasting, drafting proposals, making
strategic recommendations.

3.   Campaign Manager

salary.com avg: $118,000

Building, launching, pacing, and optimizing the day-to-day of paid ad campaigns.
This is critical, and normally requires multiple people with experience across several ad
platforms and tactics.

4.   These are all expensive, and don’t account for technology, recruiting, training, ofﬁce
equipment, and other routine expenses. Most agencies under $10MM in gross sales simply
can’t justify the cost of hiring their own team, and hiring sub-par staff for the sake of cost
savings would only result in sub-par campaigns for my clients.

“I love not having to “think” about all the
elements that goes into creating a digital
marketing department- hiring the proper
staff, expertise, technology, overhead....
I love the cost savings even more”

– Andy P., Founder,
Arthur Elliott Marketing Group.

“White Label Digital has integrated
into our team without the burden
of cost. And yet we lean on them
whenever we need too”

– Martin V., Vice President,
  Arthur Elliott Marketing Group.
