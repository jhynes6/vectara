Campaign Criteria

Targeting

Describe your top three target personas (clients):
 Small-mid sized ad agencies which may staff design & dev talent but lack paid ad resources that we offer.
 Marketing agencies which focus on websites, creative work, and branding, where they need our in-depth ad expertise to activate that work and drive results for their clients.
 Smaller agencies (2-10 ppl) with local and regional clients; the largest names, we don’t want. We’d prefer a regional $30k/mo advertiser over a national $200k/mo brand.
 Industries: ad agencies, marketing agencies, creative agencies, branding agencies, B2C preferablyTitles/depts: owner titles, marketing titlesHC: 1-15
 Are there industries you won’t sell to? No.

Offerings

What services do you sell to your top 3 target personas? (ex. PPC, Social Content, Email Marketing) 
 Digital Ad strategy to align with client goals and best practices, ad placement, ad tracking (websites, GTM, phone tracking), ad optimization and full reporting suite. We run all types of paid digital ads - we do NOT handle email, direct mail, or terrestrial radio/tv buys (we do run streaming audio and CTV/OTT ads).
 For each service, what are your top offers (packages/examples) that you would be willing to pitch them?
 We excel at direct-response marketing, with experience managing N.A.’s largest online advertiser ($100,000,000 annually, in the fin-serv space). Each solution is unique to the client, there’s no quick way to ‘package up’ what we do, such that we could simply point to it (that customization is part of our value-add).

Cost of Services

What is your average order value? What are your “Starting At” costs for your services?
 We run ad campaigns as low as $500/mo, but that’s only tolerable at scale (i.e. an agency might run 50 of those $500 flights in a month). Because we sell to agencies, we also have to tolerate some smaller flights for the sake of the larger ticket items (i.e. we need to be able to help their $500/mo client, so that we’re here to help the $40,000/mo client when they come along). In general though, anything under $5k/mo starts to get too small to be profitable.

Service Differentiation

What makes you different from your competitors? What is your “special sauce”?
 Our differentiator is our level of experience and depth of expertise. We don’t have or hire interns, anyone touching a client’s ads has at least 10 years of experience. We’re modeled after Robert’s LendingTree experience, internal team of high-level experts, no vendors or agencies, only internal, FT staff – that’s what we want to let small-mid sized agencies “plug into”, getting them access to a level of expertise they’d never staff themselves.

Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? What do you do to improve their business?
 Consolidating all digital into one place, with 24/7 reporting that covers all of what a brand is running, including GA4 or offline data which we incorporate into a client’s reporting (even for things that we don’t actively manage for them). We also make ourselves available to the end-client/brands, and do everything we can to help answer questions (often helping with things we don’t “charge for”) and help shepherd the advertiser down a successful path.

Case Studies and Previous Customer Successes

For each service, what are case studies or recent customer successes that you use to highlight your expertise in your field?
 We’ll share some case studies, they vary greatly across a host of business verticals.
