## [Digital Ad Campaign Must-Have #1](https://whitelabeldigital.co/digital-ad-campaign-must-have-1/)

By Robert Pettee

**Digital Strategies That Drive Results** At White Label Digital, we focus on performance and analytics (to drive performance). Our campaigns are designed to deliver measurable outcomes, employing various tactics and testing strategies drive measurable results and better ROl for our clients. Here are four things we see as non-negotiable with every campaign that we run: **Precision Targeting That Converts** There’s a ton of garbage inventory out there, and while we care more about the user than where exactly we’re reaching them, it’s important to leverage proper black/block lists, category exclusions, and otherwise put guardrails up. Using first-party CRM data, lookalike modeling, in-market intent signals, affinity targets, and even some old school content targeting are all viable options, whether you’re marketing locally or nationwide. For direct-response goals, focus on the lowest-hanging first; there’s no need to spend money creating demand until after you’ve exhausted what demand is already on the table. For branding & awareness efforts, CTV/OTT can be great if the budget is large enough; smaller budgets, especially localized campaigns, should consider YouTube or traditional video, with a focus on :15s spots that you should run as non-skippable placements (longer spots or ‘skippable’ placements have users skipping after a few seconds of your video). **Dynamic Budgeting Based on Real-Time Demand and Performance** We adjust spend based on what your business needs now, scaling-up when opportunity is high, pulling back when it’s not. While this may not seem to apply to every advertiser, there’s always a reason to move budget in fluid fashion based on data and results. Seasons change, consumer sentiment changes, and so-on; digital ad budgets have the luxury of being fluid, which should be used to optimize ad spend and strive for higher ROI. Multi-location advertisers in particular, can leverage store-level campaigns with variable budgets to maximize ROI as a whole (group of locations). **Segmented Testing in Every Way** We continuously test performance across campaign types and locations (e.g., PMax vs. SEM, Paid Social vs. Display) to see what works best in each context. No assumptions-just clean, actionable data. Not every test is appropriate for every client, nor do we recommend exposing huge swaths of budget to never ending risk of a failed test. Prioritize what segmentation is available, confirm what’s actionable, test with clarity in data, and above all trust the numbers. We don’t care “why” one promotion out-performs another, we only care that we know which promotion drives better ROI, so that we can act on it. **Smart Bid Strategy Optimization** We refine bidding strategies to maximize efficiency and capture high-intent traffic-so every dollar is working as hard as it can. GTM Container management, GA4 data integration, and custom website conversion tracking are all included in what we do, because we know we can’t do a proper job without it. Consider ROI and Revenue oriented bid strategies for lead-gen efforts, by assigning a “weight” to each conversion type based on the relative value for each. Maximum conversions is one thing, but what if Applications are worth $250, Contact Forms are worth $100 (they’re often existing customers or spam), and Phone Calls are worth $20 (again, existing customers and spam)? These things can all be tested but it’s critical that you understand how things are being tracked, what tests are appropriate or have the best chance of being impactful, and what metrics to focus on – or ignore – based on your test and goals. Digital ad campaigns are living, breathing things that can learn and get better over time. That includes optimizing landing pages and conversions funnels. Every dollar you spend should be telling you something that makes the next dollar you spend more capable, more profitable, or otherwise better spent than the last one. Those opportunities don’t always present themselves, but for large or small budget advertisers, they exist if you know where to find them and how to exploit them. Needless to say, we’d be happy to discuss how we do exactly that.

## [Marketing Sensitive Content Categories](https://whitelabeldigital.co/marketing-sensitive-content-categories/)

By Robert Pettee

If you work agency-side, you’ve likely had to navigate the hoops required to advertise tricky content categories like firearms, Cannabis, Housing, or Politics. The latter of which can be especially tricky, not just in getting approvals and ads live, but ensuring adequate safeguards to limit and even restrict feedback and commentary. Employment falls on this list as well, but for us has been a non-issue, largely because corporate jobs that we might promote aren’t more or less attractive to any gender. Some of these categories are flat-out rejected by large ad platforms, Google Ads for example, won’t let you advertise firearms or booze. Cannabis is ok in many states if you navigate through some hoops, most of which are very reasonable. Housing, politics, and employment are “limited” or “restricted”, but can get approval in many cases, the ad targeting options might just be lacking. The best bet is to hunt down specific ad networks that have pre-approved publishers pooled together to advertise an otherwise restricted or prohibited type of business. Think of it as a library of solutions, just to keep on hand. While you’re at it, find a digital out of home source, or maybe a niche native platform. If you’re a brand or business manager, all of that seems like a lot of work. As an agency [that supports other agencies], the trick is that research takes time. It’s difficult to stay on top of, without feeling like you’re wasteful with half of a day, but it’s normally worth a small, consistent effort. We aim for a healthy mix of new players and platforms, as well as changes happening within existing platforms, to have as many viable, vetted options available for our clients as possible. The landscape of tools, and clients for whom they might be a good fit, changes constantly. It pays to know someone is on top of it all, keeping the toolbox clean and organized.

## [You Need Creative Variation](https://whitelabeldigital.co/you-need-creative-variation/)

By Robert Pettee

Whenever we talk about creative refreshes and making sure ad creative isn’t getting stale, the client hears, “new promotions”. That’s not necessary, most of the time. New promotions are great, but in keeping your creative fresh, it’s more about the context, colors, and CTAs in your designs. Even a new promotion needs a different look and feel, changing “10% off” to “15% off” is relatively meaningless if your design doesn’t change. Especially with a small audience, keep your creative fresh. Similar to developing landing pages for paid ad traffic, the cost of getting multiple designs for testing and creative refreshes is minimal if you simply consider this during the initial development phase. Changing text, background images, CTAs, even button colors, are all easily done if you request those pieces all at once. It’s often the difference between adding an hour to your initial development time, or spending several hours for the same designs as “round two” at a later date. Concurrently running different variations also helps ensure that you don’t pin your results on a single phrase or CTA. Different people react to different images, colors, and text, so variation helps improve the odds that you’ll show any user the type of message they’re more likely to respond to. AI tools are coming-in handy here, where slight changes to colors, backgrounds, buttons, and text become quick, easy, and cheap. What those tools don’t lend though, is policing brand guidelines or lending human insight into whether or not what you’ve changed is well suited for real human consumption. Use those tools wisely, and be sure to lend some specific direction in what iterations are developed for use with ads.

## [Targeting Your Client Their Own Ads](https://whitelabeldigital.co/reach-your-client-with-their-ads/)

By Robert Pettee

Time and time again, we benefit from taking a few minutes to consider how best to reach a client with their own paid ads. It sounds wasteful, but we’re talking about pennies a day. On a $12 CPM, which is higher than necessary to ensure quality placement and context, you can show an ad 4 times per day to each of 10 people, at a cost of $14.40 per month. If your client is engaged, or perhaps wondering if their ads are actually reaching people online, it’s worth $10 or $20 a month to show your client their ads “in the wild”. Consider a frequency cap, of course, and ad pulsing or only running on a couple days per week can help to minimize waste while ensuring adequate reach. When a client discussion starts with them proclaiming that they see their ads all over the place, you’re off to a good start. Digital ads can feel like smoke and mirrors to some clients; we know what they can do, and we take it upon ourselves to truly drive value, but don’t assume that your clients understand all of that, nor that they inherently trust in it. Beyond simply making a client feel comfortable that their ads are truly reaching an audience of people online, consider who “your client” is, exactly, and what tiny remarketing segments or user targets could assist your client. For example, we run a large volume of campaigns for leasing and apartment properties. You’d not think to target existing residents with ads, as they already live there, but what about reinforcing the benefits and advantages of living there, in a manner that might lower the rate at which residents move out?

## [Viewability Has Value](https://whitelabeldigital.co/viewability-has-value/)

By Robert Pettee

Paid Search and Facebook (Meta) ads have been atop the list of useful tactics for a while. Viewability is of little or no concern with those tactics, and SEM would even have us ignoring ad impressions all together. As you venture into exchange inventory across the web for image and video placements, viewability is something that you should be monitoring. In case you’re reading this and have the question, IAB deems an ad “viewable” if at least 50% of it is in view for at least 1 second. That’s a pretty low bar. We don’t normally suggest 3rd party verification for viewability, nor brand safety, but there are settings, targeting options, and reports available to monitor and control the quality of inventory coming through your DSP buys. It’s important to understand the different targeting options, where you can target or block inventory known to be (a) above the fold, or (b) below the fold, keeping in mind that a lot of placements haven’t been confirmed one way or the other. Targeting only placements known to be ATF will be expensive and limited in scale, so blocking placements known to be below the fold is a safer place to start. There are different viewability targets and levers from one DSP to the next. Not all ad impressions are alike, the same way that not all clicks are alike. Once again, proper tracking and clean data are critical. Some of this is also gut feel, where an experienced media buyer can lend insight into the quality of your buy, what options are available to control that quality, and what specific changes would mean to your KPIs and overall performance. Also, don’t completely count placements out just because they’re below the fold, it’s about cost-effectiveness, more than face value. I used to love the viewability and size of Facebook’s news feed placement, but that inventory is getting smaller while Meta basically forces us to let go of placement-level targeting. It’s been the case for a long time; if your campaigns have a finite goal, your CPA will go up if you start playing with placement targeting, even if you’re using it to target the placements that Meta’s data told you drove the lowest CPA. Illogical, at best, but very real… and frustrating.

## [What is a Conversion Worth?](https://whitelabeldigital.co/what-is-a-conversion-worth/)

By Robert Pettee

We’ve recently been revisiting the value that we associate to conversion events like phone calls or form completions. Clients with online purchase events are easily handled, once the technical work is done. For most clients though, associating a value to each conversion event can be exceedingly difficult to get right. For every client, it’s worth exploring. We often find ourselves simply offering a calculation to a client that depicts how many of each conversion type we’d expect to see for every $1K in ad spend, for example. What is a conversion, after all? For a typical client, in Google alone, we might have: – Clicks to Call (Google Maps, website) – Calls placed (as tracked by Google Ads call numbers) – Calls over a certain duration (deemed a “conversion” in Google Ads) – Contact forms – Application, Tour, or Calendar bookings – Purchase or Subscription Consider this little problem from a different perspective; it’s less important that you know exactly what a conversion is worth, and more important that you know what each conversion is worth in relation to the other conversions. We often use a scale of 1 to 100 (1-1,000 for larger ticket events). In that scale, with your most valuable conversion being worth “100”, where do the other conversions fall on that scale? Maybe a phone call is worth 1/2 what an online form is worth, and you might ignore calls that come from branded SEM traffic as those are a unique circumstance. Maybe calls over 2 or 3 minutes are worth 100, while shorter calls are worth less. You might also have things like newsletter sign-ups, coupons or white paper downloads, or even sessions over a certain duration. Those little things can be helpful to feed back to ad platforms as signals to help guide ad campaigns, but you’ll need to use them properly or you’ll drive yourself off the rails. Value is only part of the equation, of course. Attribution modeling is a different topic, but applying values and mining the data is important without getting complicated with modeling, cross-channel attribution, and other tricky bits. Keep in mind that this might immediately ID sources of higher value “conversions”, but it also enables testing of value-oriented bid strategies in Google Ads. You’ll want at least a month of value tracking in your data before you test it, but Maximize Conversion Value could help you drive more of the conversions that you really want. To put this another way, if you’re not paying attention to what value you attribute to each conversion event, you’re telling Google Ad that they’re all equal in value. Don’t feel compelled to assign values if you truly can’t ID them with some level of certainty, but at the very least you’ll want to make sure forms and purchases aren’t seen as equal to a phone call or click-based action.

## [Is Your Digital Tool Box Full?](https://whitelabeldigital.co/is-your-digital-tool-box-full/)

By Robert Pettee

Paid Search is easily covered these days, albeit often by inexperienced, well-meaning staffers as an entry into digital ad management. That is to say, most people think they manage Google Ads well and most of those people simply aren’t doing that. Beyond SEM, do your chops extend beyond Google Ads and into the real DSP realm? Can you execute storyboard (sequential images depicted to each user) or high-end video campaigns? Do you have access to full episode and CTV/OTT inventory? Does your digital game extend to streaming audio or digital billboards, interior signage, and other OOH placements? What about localized, specialized, scalable campaigns? Can you handle 1,000 individual franchise campaigns with varying budgets and reporting needs? Do you have the capacity to launch, pace, track, and report on 1,000 location-specific ad campaigns? Are you integrating GA4 data in your ad performance reporting, monitoring for bad clicks and verifying conversion information? Can you integrate offline call and conversion data with your performance reports, or at least monitor for up-ticks in untracked conversions? Is your data consolidated and automated for ease of use, made available and depicted properly for each client? What are you doing to show Account Managers or C-level team members cross-client metrics? Do you have pacing reports that show your target and actual spend across platforms, to track overall budget and spend allocation? Beyond simply fulfilling an ad buy, are you refreshing creative appropriately and looking for areas of optimization, day-parts, or geo/demo segments worth pruning or focusing on directly? Do you fulfill an order, or are you pushing your clients to move budget among channels and targets to maximize overall performance? I often find that last question to be a follow-up, requiring first to confirm that someone is tracking properly and accurately, such that finding ways to improve performance is then possible. Perhaps most importantly, do you have someone to whom you can turn and ask questions like these, here? Our goal is to lend part-time effort in various areas, so that our agency clients can avoid staffing an expensive team of experts that might operate at 20% capacity. Successful digital campaigns require having various areas of expertise and experience on-hand, which is expensive, but made feasible with the sharing of resources across a large array and volume of clients.
