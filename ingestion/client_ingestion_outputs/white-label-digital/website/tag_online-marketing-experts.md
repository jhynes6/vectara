## [Maximizing Website Traffic Volume](https://whitelabeldigital.co/maximizing-website-traffic-volume/)

By Robert Pettee

Most clients would tell you that they want to run paid ads in an attempt to maximize website traffic, to which we reply, “why, exactly”? If it’s because you want phone calls, online forms, or purchases to take place, say so, because “website traffic” in itself is somewhat meaningless. In fact, many vendors would shovel low-quality placements into your buy that show a high CTR and low CPC, maximizing website traffic, but are those people all reaching your site? Are they bouncing after 1 second? It often seems that we should all stop talking about “website traffic” to concern ourselves with quality as much as quantity, looking at GA4 data to ensure we’re driving valuable clicks that reach the site, don’t show a sky-high bounce rate, and actually engage with the brand. The complexity of metrics and dependancies also tends to confuse this discussion, where a client will look at a high CTR and think “maximum website traffic”. No, that’s not how any of this works; on any given budget, it’s a lower CPC that will garner more clicks and presumably, more website visits. With paid search specifically, we get peppered with questions as to why Impressions look low, derived from a complete misunderstanding as to how paid search works. Nobody targets or pays for Impressions with SEM ads. In fact, the better we do with improving the CTR of your ads, the fewer Impressions you’ll garner with your budget (takes fewer Impressions to reach the click volume that exhausts your ad budget). Max click and max website visits are auction and bidding strategies, not client goals. The end goal is what you want happening after the ad click, not the click itself. An experienced digital ops team can sort through this noise, as our team does, but it’s always interesting to hear how different clients express their goals. – _We’re always looking for problems to solve, and we’re happy to show you how we do it.

## [Is Your Digital Tool Box Full?](https://whitelabeldigital.co/is-your-digital-tool-box-full/)

By Robert Pettee

Paid Search is easily covered these days, albeit often by inexperienced, well-meaning staffers as an entry into digital ad management. That is to say, most people think they manage Google Ads well and most of those people simply aren’t doing that. Beyond SEM, do your chops extend beyond Google Ads and into the real DSP realm? Can you execute storyboard (sequential images depicted to each user) or high-end video campaigns? Do you have access to full episode and CTV/OTT inventory? Does your digital game extend to streaming audio or digital billboards, interior signage, and other OOH placements? What about localized, specialized, scalable campaigns? Can you handle 1,000 individual franchise campaigns with varying budgets and reporting needs? Do you have the capacity to launch, pace, track, and report on 1,000 location-specific ad campaigns? Are you integrating GA4 data in your ad performance reporting, monitoring for bad clicks and verifying conversion information? Can you integrate offline call and conversion data with your performance reports, or at least monitor for up-ticks in untracked conversions? Is your data consolidated and automated for ease of use, made available and depicted properly for each client? What are you doing to show Account Managers or C-level team members cross-client metrics? Do you have pacing reports that show your target and actual spend across platforms, to track overall budget and spend allocation? Beyond simply fulfilling an ad buy, are you refreshing creative appropriately and looking for areas of optimization, day-parts, or geo/demo segments worth pruning or focusing on directly? Do you fulfill an order, or are you pushing your clients to move budget among channels and targets to maximize overall performance? I often find that last question to be a follow-up, requiring first to confirm that someone is tracking properly and accurately, such that finding ways to improve performance is then possible. Perhaps most importantly, do you have someone to whom you can turn and ask questions like these, here? Our goal is to lend part-time effort in various areas, so that our agency clients can avoid staffing an expensive team of experts that might operate at 20% capacity. Successful digital campaigns require having various areas of expertise and experience on-hand, which is expensive, but made feasible with the sharing of resources across a large array and volume of clients. That’s the idea behind this thing, after all. – _We’re always looking for problems to solve, and we’re happy to show you how we do it.
