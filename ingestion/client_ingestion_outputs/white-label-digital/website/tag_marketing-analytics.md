## [Digital Ad Campaign Must-Have #4](https://whitelabeldigital.co/digital-ad-campaign-must-have-4/)

By Robert Pettee

**Comprehensive Analytics & Reporting** We believe that data should drive action, not confusion. That’s why we leverage powerful, easy-to-understand reporting that goes beyond surface metrics and brings clarity to campaign performance. Conversion tracking, tag management, and custom reports are a necessity for every campaign we build and manage. Whether you’re an agency managing clients or a brand managing growth, clean data and accurate reporting are a must-have. Real insights, in real-time.

**24/7 Access to Fully Customizable Dashboards** Monitor campaign performance any time, from any device. Layouts, KPIs, date ranges, and data visualizations to fit your specific reporting needs and goals. Color templates, fonts, and logos are options, but it’s really about the data and what it’s telling us about your campaigns.

**Cross-Channel Attribution & Analysis** We unify data from paid search, display, social, video, CTV/OTT, and even custom publisher buys to give you a clear, apples-to-apples view of what’s performing-across the entire funnel. We even incorporate GA4 data to meet specific needs, and can include offline sales data where it’s available.

**Automated KPI Alerts & Performance Triggers** Stay ahead of the curve with real-time alerts for key changes in campaign metrics. Whether it’s a spike in cost per lead or a drop in CTR, you’ll know the moment something shifts-so we can act fast.

**Email Reports & Scheduled Delivery** Set automated reports to deliver daily, weekly, or monthly summaries straight to any email inbox, keeping everyone informed without logging into a dashboard, which now almost universally require multi-factor authenticator apps.

**GA4 Data Integration** Leverage metrics like bounce rate, engagement rate, and create & track proper custom events to better understand the quality of every click to your website. This not only helps paid ad analysis, but lends insight into all of your website’s traffic for a better understanding of all of your website visitors.

**Offline & CRM Data Integration** Need to show ROl beyond digital? We can import offline conversions, sales data, or CRM entries to complete the customer journey and tie performance directly to business outcomes. This gets a bit tricky, but essentially we can leverage names and emails in offline data to ID users that have converted from online ads (the ad platforms do the matching, keeping PII out of our reach).

**Built for Transparency & Trust** From high-level summaries to detailed performance breakdowns, our reporting makes it easy to share wins, spot issues, and build trust with stakeholders, whether agencies or brands.
