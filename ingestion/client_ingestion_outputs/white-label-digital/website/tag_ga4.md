## [Paid Ads Drive Organic Traffic](https://whitelabeldigital.co/paid-ads-drive-organic-traffic/)

By Robert Pettee

There’s definitely a correlation between paid ad traffic and organic website visits, starting with users visiting across multiple devices (you found me with an ad on my mobile FB news feed, I’ll be back from my iPad or laptop). There’s also an inability to track some devices or users, that’s just a technical reality. I do believe that GA4 maintains the capacity to accurately show you your “organic search” activity, it’s the “direct” and other nondescript sources in GA4 reports that’ll contain the rest. Consider pulsing your ad campaigns, or looking at the before and after where a client’s ad budget changed dramatically. There’s no single formula here, it takes some sleuthing, and be careful not to discount offline marketing activities as drivers of direct and organic site traffic. In some cases, general market activity can dramatically impact organic site traffic. Still though, take a look and plot organic search and other/direct (sum of all unpaid that are not organic search) over time. Weekly is fine, give yourself a 2 or 3 month window pre- and post budget change. You’ll need to sprinkle some gut feel onto this, related to offline marketing, seasonality, and some other factors. Also, you don’t want to be doing this sort of thing incorrectly or you’ll jerk the wheel into a bridge abutment; find an expert, should you need one. Brand keywords deserve a mention as well, where it can be very interesting to see what happens if you prevent your ads from appearing for your brand’s search queries. Because there is not real “exact match” any more, and Performance Max campaigns have one foot in the SEM space without lending any real controls to us, this can require account-level negatives. If you wanted, you could house your brand keywords and campaigns in an additional Ads Account. With that, you can turn it on, off, up, or down at will, without impacting the other campaigns. This sort of analysis is another reason why I like the use of distinct vanity URLs in direct mail campaigns, as a way to accurately ID the source of that site traffic. Not every digital ad click can be traced (device/browser limitations), and not every direct mail customer will use the vanity URL. Still though, it’s nice to do as much house cleaning as possible. – _We’re always looking for problems to solve, and we’re happy to show you how we do it.

## [More Data is Better, but Explain the Bigger Picture](https://whitelabeldigital.co/more-data-is-better-but-explain-the-bigger-picture/)

By Robert Pettee

We often find ourselves having to preemptively explain what might come, or not come, from incorporating more data into our scope. Normally that means merging disparate data source, but even something as simple as appending GA4 website analytics data to our paid ad data can bring more questions than answers for a client. Consider that there’s always a difference between Ad Clicks and Website Visits, which isn’t intuitive but is very critical to examine in some circumstances. To the average client, a click on an ad is a visit to a website. That’s not always true, especially from some lower quality placements or in-app placements where users didn’t intend to click the ad. In Google Ads especially, because of shared and automatically created assets that don’t contain URL parameters that we’d normally use to tag & track our efforts, GA4 data isn’t a true representation of your total advertising efforts. GA4 data is a representation of the site as a whole, inclusive of true organic traffic and traffic that the site deems organic, but was really driven by something else. Still though, bringing session duration, engagements, and particular Key Events back into our paid ad data and reporting can be illuminating. We just need to be sure the client understands what they’re looking at, and why it looks the way that it does. The same goes for offline data, which we often ingest and house alongside the digital ad data that we normally depict for clients. In this case, it’s more about having a report that shows you all of your paid efforts and results, rather than attempting to make direct associations as to what digital sources are responsible for specific offline conversions or events. On that note though, Google has great tools for using offline data (name and email) to attribute back to ad activity. – _We’re always looking for problems to solve, and we’re happy to show you how we do it.
