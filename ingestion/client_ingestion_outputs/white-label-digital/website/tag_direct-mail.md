## Digital Direct Mail?

By Robert Pettee

We often get requests from various direct mail providers to lend small add-ons to direct mail campaigns, using their list data to target those users online. It’s possible, but too often we’re talking about single business locations that want $150 worth of display ads to add to the $500 direct mail campaign they’re running. On a regional or national level, it’s a different story, as usual things become more feasible with larger budgets. Still though, it’s worth testing if your clients are running enough direct mail; targeting 2,700 people is a waste of everyone’s time. What can be difficult is getting a client to stop thinking about “addressable” ads. When your starting point is that of USPS addresses and names, it can be difficult to pull that direct connection out of someone’s hands. It feels good, like reading a real book instead of a screen, but it often overlooks key aspects that differentiate digital ads from direct mail. Guide the client, should they need it, to a place where we don’t care what someone’s name or home address is, because we’re finding them online and pushing them down an online conversion funnel. The client wants to target households at the address-level because someone told them it’s likely that someone living there is a good target. Using that household data in the online realm means we can’t use Paid Search or some of the best performing In-Market and Affinity audiences available to us. The client is asking to target a mailbox because (a) maybe the right person gets the mail, and (b) maybe they’ll be in-market for their product soon. Instead, let’s ignore the home address and target people who Google knows recently searched for your product, if they aren’t already targeting people who are actively searching with Paid Search campaigns. What about letting your online ads test messaging and design elements that inform your direct mail designs? Within your direct mail, are you creating vanity URLs to test and learn which designs or messaging gets people to visit your site? You’d normally think of that with email campaigns, but I like testing vanity URLs where the volume permits (small audiences or pools can lend unreliable data). Those vanity URLs can make it easy to create small retargeting audiences to echo the message of that campaign. – _We’re always looking for problems to solve, and we’re happy to show you how we do it.
