## [Get Your Clients Engaged with Their Google Business Profiles](https://whitelabeldigital.co/get-your-clients-engaged-with-their-google-business-profiles/)

By Robert Pettee

Near the top of the list of things people stop thinking about the minute it’s created or “done”, Google Business Profiles often go overlooked. Most of the clients that ask us what they can do to better promote themselves locally, have never taken the time to post pictures, thank customers and reviewers, or address their Google Business profiles at all. Performance Max campaigns can drive good ROI, but there’s ample opportunity for business owners to help themselves for free. It’s free, readily available, doesn’t require fancy creative assets or tools, and has huge potential for a local business. Look for more content, pictures, and reviews. Make sure you thank positive commenters and appease negative ones as best you can, it’s OK to apologize and simply ask that they give you another chance to lend a positive experience. We often suggest that someone other than the business owner handle this work, partly because pics and posts from customer-facing staff tend to be more relatable but also because it’s critical to avoid any personal feelings when replying to negative reviews. As a business owner it can be difficult not to feel almost like someone is personally attacking you, but that mindset can lend to negative impact on the business if not kept in check. Know your client, and be sure to find common ground and oversight, such that they’re not likely to paint outside the lines and they reach-out for assistance with anything truly unwieldy. For many businesses, we recommend keeping an eye out for customers with dogs, or who otherwise stand out or are in a great mood. Maybe snap a picture of someone posing with a cool new purchase or product, or just just the new product itself. Keep your hours up to date, including holidays, and integrate your booking or ordering systems, where applicable. – _We’re always looking for problems to solve, and we’re happy to show you how we do it.
