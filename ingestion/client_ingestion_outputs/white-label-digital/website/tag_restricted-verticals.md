## [Marketing Sensitive Content Categories](https://whitelabeldigital.co/marketing-sensitive-content-categories/)

By Robert Pettee

If you work agency-side, you’ve likely had to navigate the hoops required to advertise tricky content categories like firearms, Cannabis, Housing, or Politics. The latter of which can be especially tricky, not just in getting approvals and ads live, but ensuring adequate safeguards to limit and even restrict feedback and commentary. Employment falls on this list as well, but for us has been a non-issue, largely because corporate jobs that we might promote aren’t more or less attractive to any gender. Some of these categories are flat-out rejected by large ad platforms, Google Ads for example, won’t let you advertise firearms or booze. Cannabis is ok in many states if you navigate through some hoops, most of which are very reasonable. Housing, politics, and employment are “limited” or “restricted”, but can get approval in many cases, the ad targeting options might just be lacking. The best bet is to hunt down specific ad networks that have pre-approved publishers pooled together to advertise an otherwise restricted or prohibited type of business. Think of it as a library of solutions, just to keep on hand. While you’re at it, find a digital out of home source, or maybe a niche native platform. If you’re a brand or business manager, all of that seems like a lot of work. As an agency that supports other agencies, the trick is that research takes time. It’s difficult to stay on top of, without feeling like you’re wasteful with half of a day, but it’s normally worth a small, consistent effort. We aim for a healthy mix of new players and platforms, as well as changes happening within existing platforms, to have as many viable, vetted options available for our clients as possible. The landscape of tools, and clients for whom they might be a good fit, changes constantly. It pays to know someone is on top of it all, keeping the toolbox clean and organized. – _We’re always looking for problems to solve, and we’re happy to show you how we do it.
