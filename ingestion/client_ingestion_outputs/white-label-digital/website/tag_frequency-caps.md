## [Ad Burnout](https://whitelabeldigital.co/ad-burnout/)

By Robert Pettee

When I worked in the financial services industry, nearly all of our paid ads were dark for the last 45 days of the year, every year. These days I think that window is 60 days, just because the holiday ad season keeps growing and consumers start tuning-out ads. It’s not that you’ll get nothing from running ads during a period of high ad saturation, but you may get more for your money if you spend the dollars elsewhere on the calendar. Most clients can’t legitimize going dark for a month or two, but everyone should consider, if not directly account for consumer ad burnout. That can happen as a general, environmental factor in the online ad space. We can’t control that, but we can navigate around it. Completely within our control though, is keeping our ad creative fresh. Varying CTAs and images means a lot, particularly where your conversion is a larger or more meaningful purchase, the likes of which have us advertising to consumers consistently in the hopes of being top of mind when they have a particular need. That scenario requires creative refreshes, else your ads are easier and easier to ignore, over time. Frequency capping also plays a role here, where every campaign should have a frequency cap to limit waste and to keep your creative feeling fresh. Frequency will vary by client and industry, but 4x daily is a good place to start. Caps don’t solve for over-indexing completely but they do provide some protection. Cross-channel frequency has become nearly impossible to measure, but each channel has frequency controls that can be leveraged. The same principles apply to promotions that come and go; alternate your verbiage and put different twists on your promotions and discounts. The one thing that doesn’t seem to get old is verbiage around “limited time” or otherwise urgency, something we see consistently successful for on-site promotions and discounts.

## [Frequency Caps and Stale Ads](https://whitelabeldigital.co/frequency-caps-and-stale-ads/)

By Robert Pettee

We don’t normally highlight or focus on frequency caps with clients, just because there are a hundred other details that need to be nailed down for every flight. We do use them, and set standards to ensure that we don’t waste ad spend or drive our ads to be stale for any individual user. The idea is that you ID an audience likely in-market for your clients’ wares, then follow them around to show them your clients’ ads and when they’re ready to convert, your client is right there. At least, that’s what I’m told. What happens if you burn your budget showing a small portion of your audience 20-30 ads every day? How wasteful might that be, and does that slice of the pie impact your overall metrics? What about ad burnout? If you show me an ad too many times, it becomes easy to ignore it, and if that’s on “day 3” of a 90-day flight, you’ve completely lost me. It’s important to run multiple creative sets, I prefer that to running a single design theme and replacing it on a cadence. Multiple creative sets also enables another optimization lever; cut the one with the lowest CTR or ‘cost per engaged site visit’, add another iteration. DSP levers let you control what level of the ad hierarchy you’re assigning a cap to. Let’s say you’re targeting 4 or 5 distinct audiences with your ads, you’ll want a cap placed at the IO level, because your Line Items (each targeting an audience) aren’t mutually exclusive. One person is likely in multiple audiences, at least we find that to be the case, so an IO-level frequency cap is most appropriate. There’s no single way to handle it, as always it’s a unique discussion for every client and it changes over time, especially as audience sizes adjust. You might also consider pulsing, where you leverage similar frequency caps but pause your ads every other week, for example. This can help extend the reach of a small budget, or help a limited creative set last longer on the calendar before going stale. Most clients would say they prefer that their ads are “always on”, whatever that means, but strategically speaking, pulsing on a small budget can be impactful. Keep in mind that weekly pulsing is too short a window for you to use this data to know what your website would produce with, and without ads. Paid Search is the only channel where you’ll see clean delineation; what happens when we run ads, and what happens when we don’t. Image, Video, and other formats drive consideration weeks, even months after a campaign is run.
