## [Driving In-Store Sales](https://whitelabeldigital.co/driving-in-store-sales/)

By Robert Pettee

We recently partnered with an agency to help them drive results for a client with over 6,000 auto parts retail stores across the U.S., with some phenomenal results. Our mission was to deliver hyper-local, scalable, and growth-focused campaigns. We needed to find a way to accommodate varying, low budgets across a ton of store locations, without a huge team of staffers to do the heavy lifting. Leveraging multiple ad accounts and ensuring store-level relevance, we crafted a unique strategy for each location. Imagine this: 32,000 distinct ad assets, including text, images, and videos, with location-specific phone numbers, landing pages, and budgets. Store-level, regional, and national reporting on-demand. Small budget campaigns can be difficult, but we were able to accommodate budgets ranging from $100 to $2,000 per month. The outcome? Increased visibility, boosted customer engagement, significant measurable growth, and optimized ad spend. We helped this retailer achieve local success on a national scale, and we can do the same for your agency’s clients. We employ custom ETL solutions, Ads Scripts and Rules for automation, and custom reporting to efficiently do the work of a much larger team. That efficiency lowers cost and improves client ROI. At White Label Digital, we’re passionate about helping agencies like yours reach new heights. Let’s discuss how we can help your clients achieve similar success! Reach out to us today.
