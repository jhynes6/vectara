## Digital Ad Campaign Must-Have #1

**Digital Strategies That Drive Results** At White Label Digital, we focus on performance and analytics (to drive performance). Our campaigns are designed to deliver measurable outcomes, employing various tactics and testing strategies drive measurable results and better ROl for our clients. Here are four things we see as non-negotiable with every campaign that we run:

**Precision Targeting That Converts** There’s a ton of garbage inventory out there, and while we care more about the user than where exactly we’re reaching them, it’s important to leverage proper black/block lists, category exclusions, and otherwise put guardrails up. Using first-party CRM data, lookalike modeling, in-market intent signals, affinity targets, and even some old school content targeting are all viable options, whether you’re marketing locally or nationwide. For direct-response goals, focus on the lowest-hanging first; there’s no need to spend money creating demand until after you’ve exhausted what demand is already on the table. For branding & awareness efforts, CTV/OTT can be great if the budget is large enough; smaller budgets, especially localized campaigns, should consider YouTube or traditional video, with a focus on :15s spots that you should run as non-skippable placements (longer spots or ‘skippable’ placements have users skipping after a few seconds of your video).

**Dynamic Budgeting Based on Real-Time Demand and Performance** We adjust spend based on what your business needs now, scaling-up when opportunity is high, pulling back when it’s not. While this may not seem to apply to every advertiser, there’s always a reason to move budget in fluid fashion based on data and results. Seasons change, consumer sentiment changes, and so-on; digital ad budgets have the luxury of being fluid, which should be used to optimize ad spend and strive for higher ROI. Multi-location advertisers in particular, can leverage store-level campaigns with variable budgets to maximize ROI as a whole (group of locations).

**Segmented Testing in Every Way** We continuously test performance across campaign types and locations (e.g., PMax vs. SEM, Paid Social vs. Display) to see what works best in each context. No assumptions-just clean, actionable data. Not every test is appropriate for every client, nor do we recommend exposing huge swaths of budget to never ending risk of a failed test. Prioritize what segmentation is available, confirm what’s actionable, test with clarity in data, and above all trust the numbers. We don’t care “why” one promotion out-performs another, we only care that we know which promotion drives better ROI, so that we can act on it.

**Smart Bid Strategy Optimization** We refine bidding strategies to maximize efficiency and capture high-intent traffic-so every dollar is working as hard as it can. GTM Container management, GA4 data integration, and custom website conversion tracking are all included in what we do, because we know we can’t do a proper job without it. Consider ROI and Revenue oriented bid strategies for lead-gen efforts, by assigning a “weight” to each conversion type based on the relative value for each. Maximum conversions is one thing, but what if Applications are worth $250, Contact Forms are worth $100 (they’re often existing customers or spam), and Phone Calls are worth $20 (again, existing customers and spam)? These things can all be tested but it’s critical that you understand how things are being tracked, what tests are appropriate or have the best chance of being impactful, and what metrics to focus on – or ignore – based on your test and goals. Digital ad campaigns are living, breathing things that can learn and get better over time. That includes optimizing landing pages and conversions funnels. Every dollar you spend should be telling you something that makes the next dollar you spend more capable, more profitable, or otherwise better spent than the last one. Those opportunities don’t always present themselves, but for large or small budget advertisers, they exist if you know where to find them and how to exploit them. Needless to say, we’d be happy to discuss how we do exactly that.
