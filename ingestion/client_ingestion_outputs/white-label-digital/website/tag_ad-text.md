By Robert Pettee

Adjusting CTAs can help to keep messaging fresh, but don’t sleep on the value of the particulars in your text. I once found that use of “home loan” and “mortgage loan” verbiage consistently drove different mixes of purchase and refinance loan applications. It’s not often that easy to distinguish, but findings like this can drive your messaging and act as something of a lever to influence your results. Testing and learning is critical here, basically just following what works best and iterating for future tests. It sounds simple, but does require working closely with your creative team to ensure that CTAs and ad text are influenced by your data and results, what you see in the marketplace, and generally just following a proper progression. You’ll also want to do whatever you can to structure tests and ensure accurate, statistically relevant results, avoiding assumptions. Test things that you don’t think will work, every now and then, especially if your messaging comes from a single person. None of us have all the answers, and it can be fun to prove yourself wrong with respect to what your motivates your audience. I usually say that I don’t care exactly why one option works better than another, I only care that I know which option works best. Don’t get caught-up in the why, because it only matters that you ID a winner and move forward. Iterate, test, learn, implement, repeat. – _We’re always looking for problems to solve, and we’re happy to show you how we do it.
