## [You Need Math and Proper Tracking, Not AI](https://whitelabeldigital.co/you-need-math-not-ai/)

By Robert Pettee

With AI being all the rage lately, a lot of advertisers are looking for ways to incorporate new AI tools into their marketing machines. The truth is, AI is already at work and well qualified campaign managers know explicitly where to engage it, and where to disable it. There’s AI influence on the publisher-side, for sure, but our focus is adveritiser-side. That’s an important distinction, and one that has us reminding clients repeatedly that Google isn’t just an advertiser-side tool, it’s primary focus is monetizing the online content, some of which they own and some of it they represent in the paid ad marketplace. Google and Meta are for profit companies, the sum total of the tools they offer are meant to maximize their revenue as a business. Hopefully that means maximizing advertiser revenue as well, but not necessarily. Keep that in mind when determining what automations and automatically enabled features to leverage. I’m not suggesting impropriety, I’m only suggesting that this perspective is an important one to keep in mind, particularly when it comes to the advice that pours-in from Google reps that seem to email and call at an intense pace. What’s best for the advertiser isn’t necessarily what’s best for Google, and that’s OK, but it’s up to the advertiser to truly understand the difference and dictate how and where their budget is spent. What most clients need is Math and clean data to work with. That means accurate conversion tracking, an eye on GA4 as your sole source of truth. GA4 lacks post-view attribution but can help de-duped conversion counts across ad platforms. Also, consider the weighting or scoring of conversion events based on value, making available some ROI and ROAS bidding options that might perform well. The math we need doesn’t have to be our own, let Google’s algorithms do the leg work, with campaign experts to guide and control that machine. Even when AI is in the mix, it needs the same reliability and accuracy in data that you do, to do all it can for you. – _We’re always looking for problems to solve, and we’re happy to show you how we do it.

## [Google Scripts and Automation](https://whitelabeldigital.co/google-scripts-and-automation/)

By Robert Pettee

Google’s Rules and Scripts applications can lend some automated safeguards to paid ad campaigns, especially where flights are short or spend is volatile for any reason. They also help where line item-level budgets are small and we’re managing hundreds of line items, where daily or MTD spend caps can automatically pause campaigns or make adjustments to daily budget targets depending on flight-to-date spend. Spend and budget varying across hundreds of line items is a nightmare to manage, unless you put the tech to work. We use this approach when managing multi-location clients; $300/mo SEM campaigns can be painful to pace, but we can run 1,000 of them without having to nurse individual campaigns. Some agency partners of ours like us to lend Google Sheets or other tools directly to their clients, lending more control over daily budgets and what ad segments and ad formats they have running or paused at any time. Sometimes the client makes changes directly in the Google Sheet, and sometimes the agency partner embeds the Google Sheet in their site, where the end client can login and make the change there. Either way, automation is a wonderful thing, and eliminating the telephone game when getting campaign updates live is a huge time saver. Google ad text can also accept price points and promotions inserted into live ads, where a Google Sheet can contain what’s live without needing to update your ads as promotions and prices fluctuate. The best use-cases are specific to a client, which makes it an interesting discussion, but one that might require the budget (or cost savings) to rationalize the time and effort. – _We’re always looking for problems to solve, and we’re happy to show you how we do it.
