## [Ad Burnout](https://whitelabeldigital.co/ad-burnout/)

By Robert Pettee

When I worked in the financial services industry, nearly all of our paid ads were dark for the last 45 days of the year, every year. These days I think that window is 60 days, just because the holiday ad season keeps growing and consumers start tuning-out ads. It’s not that you’ll get nothing from running ads during a period of high ad saturation, but you may get more for your money if you spend the dollars elsewhere on the calendar. Most clients can’t legitimize going dark for a month or two, but everyone should consider, if not directly account for consumer ad burnout. That can happen as a general, environmental factor in the online ad space. We can’t control that, but we can navigate around it. Completely within our control though, is keeping our ad creative fresh. Varying CTAs and images means a lot, particularly where your conversion is a larger or more meaningful purchase, the likes of which have us advertising to consumers consistently in the hopes of being top of mind when they have a particular need. That scenario requires creative refreshes, else your ads are easier and easier to ignore, over time. Frequency capping also plays a role here, where every campaign should have a frequency cap to limit waste and to keep your creative feeling fresh. Frequency will vary by client and industry, but 4x daily is a good place to start. Caps don’t solve for over-indexing completely but they do provide some protection. Cross-channel frequency has become nearly impossible to measure, but each channel has frequency controls that can be leveraged. The same principles apply to promotions that come and go; alternate your verbiage and put different twists on your promotions and discounts. The one thing that doesn’t seem to get old is verbiage around “limited time” or otherwise urgency, something we see consistently successful for on-site promotions and discounts. – _We’re always looking for problems to solve, and we’re happy to show you how we do it.
