## You Need Creative Variation

Published May 14, 2025

Whenever we talk about creative refreshes and making sure ad creative isn’t getting stale, the client hears, “new promotions”. That’s not necessary, most of the time. New promotions are great, but in keeping your creative fresh, it’s more about the context, colors, and CTAs in your designs. Even a new promotion needs a different look and feel, changing “10% off” to “15% off” is relatively meaningless if your design doesn’t change. Especially with a small audience, keep your creative fresh.

Similar to developing landing pages for paid ad traffic, the cost of getting multiple designs for testing and creative refreshes is minimal if you simply consider this during the initial development phase. Changing text, background images, CTAs, even button colors, are all easily done if you request those pieces all at once. It’s often the difference between adding an hour to your initial development time, or spending several hours for the same designs as “round two” at a later date.

Concurrently running different variations also helps ensure that you don’t pin your results on a single phrase or CTA. Different people react to different images, colors, and text, so variation helps improve the odds that you’ll show any user the type of message they’re more likely to respond to. AI tools are coming-in handy here, where slight changes to colors, backgrounds, buttons, and text become quick, easy, and cheap. What those tools don’t lend though, is policing brand guidelines or lending human insight into whether or not what you’ve changed is well suited for real human consumption. Use those tools wisely, and be sure to lend some specific direction in what iterations are developed for use with ads.
