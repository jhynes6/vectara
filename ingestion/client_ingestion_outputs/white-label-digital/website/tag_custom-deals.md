## [Leveraging Private Deals for Quality Inventory](https://whitelabeldigital.co/leveraging-private-deals-for-quality-inventory/)

By Robert Pettee

For streaming audio and CTV/OTT buys, private deals in a quality DSP are a primary lever for most brands. The end clients like to know they’re getting play within specific, familiar networks and programming. There’s also a certain level of trust that comes with full episode content from the likes of NBC, CBS, or Discovery. Add to that, the concept of getting top-tier exposure without high minimums, and often at what seems like a discounted rate. We also engage private deals when incorporating digital out of home in a client’s media mix. I’m not always a fan of the lack of tracking with DOOH, but it can be impactful and something a client likes to see, like running a 15-second spot with audio at gas pumps and train stations across the cities they do business in. Maybe it’s reminiscent of traditional, offline media. Private deals can often rely on the publisher to target and construct the audience, where you lack some of the controls in the DSP which you might otherwise use. Often, using those controls can prevent the ads from running properly. On the flip side of that coin, the publisher may have other, perhaps very specific (to their inventory and audience) levers at their disposal that would benefit your buy. That’s worth a discussion. – _We’re always looking for problems to solve, and we’re happy to show you how we do it.
