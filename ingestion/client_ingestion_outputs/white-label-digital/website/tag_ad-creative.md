## [Nobody Tests Ad Creative Enough](https://whitelabeldigital.co/nobody-tests-ad-creative-enough/)

By Robert Pettee

Remember “lower my bills” (.com) 20 years ago, with dancing elephants and weirdo animation in their display ads, all over the internet? I do, which makes me old for this industry, but we’ll move past that. I not only miss the days of frenetic creative iteration, I miss the data that came with it. I miss finding a win out of nowhere, quantifiably doing more with a static budget. I think I liked it most because it lent marketers avenues to prove their worth, even competing for budgets and access to tools. I wish more clients would lend more iterations of their ad creative; slight changes to an offer or CTA, button text or color, different background images, that sort of stuff. It doesn’t matter what works best – which is not solely based on CTR – it only matters that we know what works best. Cut the loser, run the winner, consider the next iteration. Test, learn, optimize, repeat. There’s a limit to the pace at which you test, of course, but there’s also value in keeping your creative fresh. Whether for testing purposes or just to keep creative fresh, consider new AI tools that might quickly and easily make those slight changes to the creative. Ideally, someone just keeps this in mind when developing the client’s creative. It takes 30 seconds to alter the text of a CTA or change a button color, and save various “versions” of an image asset. Done after the fact though, it seems like a large effort. – _We’re always looking for problems to solve, and we’re happy to show you how we do it.

## [You Need Creative Variation](https://whitelabeldigital.co/you-need-creative-variation/)

By Robert Pettee

Whenever we talk about creative refreshes and making sure ad creative isn’t getting stale, the client hears, “new promotions”. That’s not necessary, most of the time. New promotions are great, but in keeping your creative fresh, it’s more about the context, colors, and CTAs in your designs. Even a new promotion needs a different look and feel, changing “10% off” to “15% off” is relatively meaningless if your design doesn’t change. Especially with a small audience, keep your creative fresh. Similar to developing landing pages for paid ad traffic, the cost of getting multiple designs for testing and creative refreshes is minimal if you simply consider this during the initial development phase. Changing text, background images, CTAs, even button colors, are all easily done if you request those pieces all at once. It’s often the difference between adding an hour to your initial development time, or spending several hours for the same designs as “round two” at a later date. Concurrently running different variations also helps ensure that you don’t pin your results on a single phrase or CTA. Different people react to different images, colors, and text, so variation helps improve the odds that you’ll show any user the type of message they’re more likely to respond to. AI tools are coming-in handy here, where slight changes to colors, backgrounds, buttons, and text become quick, easy, and cheap. What those tools don’t lend though, is policing brand guidelines or lending human insight into whether or not what you’ve changed is well suited for real human consumption. Use those tools wisely, and be sure to lend some specific direction in what iterations are developed for use with ads. – _We’re always looking for problems to solve, and we’re happy to show you how we do it.
