## [You Need Math and Proper Tracking, Not AI](https://whitelabeldigital.co/you-need-math-not-ai/)

By Robert Pettee

With AI being all the rage lately, a lot of advertisers are looking for ways to incorporate new AI tools into their marketing machines. The truth is, AI is already at work and well qualified campaign managers know explicitly where to engage it, and where to disable it. There’s AI influence on the publisher-side, for sure, but our focus is advertiser-side. That’s an important distinction, and one that has us reminding clients repeatedly that Google isn’t just an advertiser-side tool, it’s primary focus is monetizing the online content, some of which they own and some of it they represent in the paid ad marketplace. Google and Meta are for profit companies, the sum total of the tools they offer are meant to maximize their revenue as a business. Hopefully that means maximizing advertiser revenue as well, but not necessarily. Keep that in mind when determining what automations and automatically enabled features to leverage. I’m not suggesting impropriety, I’m only suggesting that this perspective is an important one to keep in mind, particularly when it comes to the advice that pours-in from Google reps that seem to email and call at an intense pace. What’s best for the advertiser isn’t necessarily what’s best for Google, and that’s OK, but it’s up to the advertiser to truly understand the difference and dictate how and where their budget is spent. What most clients need is Math and clean data to work with. That means accurate conversion tracking, an eye on GA4 as your sole source of truth. GA4 lacks post-view attribution but can help de-duped conversion counts across ad platforms. Also, consider the weighting or scoring of conversion events based on value, making available some ROI and ROAS bidding options that might perform well. The math we need doesn’t have to be our own, let Google’s algorithms do the leg work, with campaign experts to guide and control that machine. Even when AI is in the mix, it needs the same reliability and accuracy in data that you do, to do all it can for you. – _We’re always looking for problems to solve, and we’re happy to show you how we do it.
