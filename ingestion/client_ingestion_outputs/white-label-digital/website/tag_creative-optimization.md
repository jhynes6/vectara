## [Nobody Tests Ad Creative Enough](https://whitelabeldigital.co/nobody-tests-ad-creative-enough/)

By Robert Pettee

Remember “lower my bills” (.com) 20 years ago, with dancing elephants and weirdo animation in their display ads, all over the internet? I do, which makes me old for this industry, but we’ll move past that. I not only miss the days of frenetic creative iteration, I miss the data that came with it. I miss finding a win out of nowhere, quantifiably doing more with a static budget. I think I liked it most because it lent marketers avenues to prove their worth, even competing for budgets and access to tools. I wish more clients would lend more iterations of their ad creative; slight changes to an offer or CTA, button text or color, different background images, that sort of stuff. It doesn’t matter what works best – which is not solely based on CTR – it only matters that we know what works best. Cut the loser, run the winner, consider the next iteration. Test, learn, optimize, repeat. There’s a limit to the pace at which you test, of course, but there’s also value in keeping your creative fresh. Whether for testing purposes or just to keep creative fresh, consider new AI tools that might quickly and easily make those slight changes to the creative. Ideally, someone just keeps this in mind when developing the client’s creative. It takes 30 seconds to alter the text of a CTA or change a button color, and save various “versions” of an image asset. Done after the fact though, it seems like a large effort. – _We’re always looking for problems to solve, and we’re happy to show you how we do it.

## [User Segmentation, No Mas](https://whitelabeldigital.co/user-segmentation-no-mas/)

By Robert Pettee

Changes in privacy and general tech over the last several years have all but completely hampered audience (user) segmentation on the client-side. Meaning, we can’t reliably segment website visitors, such that testing landing pages and conversion funnels no longer lets us ensure that whatever test variation you see first is the only one that you see. You’re in “bucket A” or “bucket B”, but not both. That’s out the window, for the most part, shy of some pretty expensive tools but even then, it’s not really clean. Same goes for creative testing, where the end user is so often behind a veil that you can’t reliably show any particular user only one of your ad creative variations. We’re back to 2005 on this point, where creative testing is still beneficial but a bit of a free-for-all. If you have a favorite plugin, give us a shout (marketing@whitelabeldigital.co), there’s always something new out there and we’d love to hear about it. Don’t let the lack of a handle convince you not to test ad creative or conversion funnels. It’s still important. I like to ask clients, “if you ran a retail store and I could tell you that as people walk-in they’ll see different layouts of your store/products, we’ll monitor which layouts they see over time, and track each layout’s impact on sales. At the end of the test we’ll tell you which layout drives the highest sales per visitor – would you want me to do that?”. The answer is obviously yes, but why people don’t do this with their websites is a mystery. Seems like a giant oversight, to me. Don’t forget that it doesn’t really matter why a color, CTA, headline, or other variation works better than another, it only matters that you know what works best so that you can act on it. Test, implement the winner, repeat, but in small increments and for large volume sites you might consider using a small portion of your site’s traffic as a test pool. You’ll also likely find different “champion” iterations from one channel or traffic source to the next. That’s OK, given the varying level of motivation and familiarity that users have across all of your marketing channels. – _We’re always looking for problems to solve, and we’re happy to show you how we do it.
