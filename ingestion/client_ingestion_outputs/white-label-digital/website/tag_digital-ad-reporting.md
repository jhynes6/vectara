## [Digital Ad Campaign Must-Have #4](https://whitelabeldigital.co/digital-ad-campaign-must-have-4/)

By Robert Pettee

**Comprehensive Analytics & Reporting** We believe that data should drive action, not confusion. That’s why we leverage powerful, easy-to-understand reporting that goes beyond surface metrics and brings clarity to campaign performance. Conversion tracking, tag management, and custom reports are a necessity for every campaign we build and manage. Whether you’re an agency managing clients or a brand managing growth, clean data and accurate reporting are a must-have. Real insights, in real-time.

**24/7 Access to Fully Customizable Dashboards** Monitor campaign performance any time, from any device. Layouts, KPIs, date ranges, and data visualizations to fit your specific reporting needs and goals. Color templates, fonts, and logos are options, but it’s really about the data and what it’s telling us about your campaigns.

**Cross-Channel Attribution & Analysis** We unify data from paid search, display, social, video, CTV/OTT, and even custom publisher buys to give you a clear, apples-to-apples view of what’s performing-across the entire funnel. We even incorporate GA4 data to meet specific needs, and can include offline sales data where it’s available.

**Automated KPI Alerts & Performance Triggers** Stay ahead of the curve with real-time alerts for key changes in campaign metrics. Whether it’s a spike in cost per lead or a drop in CTR, you’ll know the moment something shifts-so we can act fast.

**Email Reports & Scheduled Delivery** Set automated reports to deliver daily, weekly, or monthly summaries straight to any email inbox, keeping everyone informed without logging into a dashboard, which now almost universally require multi-factor authenticator apps.

**GA4 Data Integration** Leverage metrics like bounce rate, engagement rate, and create & track proper custom events to better understand the quality of every click to your website. This not only helps paid ad analysis, but lends insight into all of your website’s traffic for a better understanding of all of your website visitors.

**Offline & CRM Data Integration** Need to show ROl beyond digital? We can import offline conversions, sales data, or CRM entries to complete the customer journey and tie performance directly to business outcomes. This gets a bit tricky, but essentially we can leverage names and emails in offline data to ID users that have converted from online ads (the ad platforms do the matching, keeping PII out of our reach).

**Built for Transparency & Trust** From high-level summaries to detailed performance breakdowns, our reporting makes it easy to share wins, spot issues, and build trust with stakeholders, whether agencies or brands.

## [You Need Math and Proper Tracking, Not AI](https://whitelabeldigital.co/you-need-math-not-ai/)

By Robert Pettee

With AI being all the rage lately, a lot of advertisers are looking for ways to incorporate new AI tools into their marketing machines. The truth is, AI is already at work and well qualified campaign managers know explicitly where to engage it, and where to disable it. There’s AI influence on the publisher-side, for sure, but our focus is advertiser-side. That’s an important distinction, and one that has us reminding clients repeatedly that Google isn’t just an advertiser-side tool, it’s primary focus is monetizing the online content, some of which they own and some of it they represent in the paid ad marketplace. Google and Meta are for profit companies, the sum total of the tools they offer are meant to maximize their revenue as a business. Hopefully that means maximizing advertiser revenue as well, but not necessarily. Keep that in mind when determining what automations and automatically enabled features to leverage. I’m not suggesting impropriety, I’m only suggesting that this perspective is an important one to keep in mind, particularly when it comes to the advice that pours-in from Google reps that seem to email and call at an intense pace. What’s best for the advertiser isn’t necessarily what’s best for Google, and that’s OK, but it’s up to the advertiser to truly understand the difference and dictate how and where their budget is spent. What most clients need is Math and clean data to work with. That means accurate conversion tracking, an eye on GA4 as your sole source of truth. GA4 lacks post-view attribution but can help de-duped conversion counts across ad platforms. Also, consider the weighting or scoring of conversion events based on value, making available some ROI and ROAS bidding options that might perform well. The math we need doesn’t have to be our own, let Google’s algorithms do the leg work, with campaign experts to guide and control that machine. Even when AI is in the mix, it needs the same reliability and accuracy in data that you do, to do all it can for you.
