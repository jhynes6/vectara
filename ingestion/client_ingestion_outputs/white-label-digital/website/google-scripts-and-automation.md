## Google Scripts and Automation

Published February 12, 2025

Google’s Rules and Scripts applications can lend some automated safeguards to paid ad campaigns, especially where flights are short or spend is volatile for any reason. They also help where line item-level budgets are small and we’re managing hundreds of line items, where daily or MTD spend caps can automatically pause campaigns or make adjustments to daily budget targets depending on flight-to-date spend. Spend and budget varying across hundreds of line items is a nightmare to manage, unless you put the tech to work. We use this approach when managing multi-location clients; $300/mo SEM campaigns can be painful to pace, but we can run 1,000 of them without having to nurse individual campaigns.

Some agency partners of ours like us to lend Google Sheets or other tools directly to their clients, lending more control over daily budgets and what ad segments and ad formats they have running or paused at any time. Sometimes the client makes changes directly in the Google Sheet, and sometimes the agency partner embeds the Google Sheet in their site, where the end client can login and make the change there. Either way, automation is a wonderful thing, and eliminating the telephone game when getting campaign updates live is a huge time saver.

Google ad text can also accept price points and promotions inserted into live ads, where a Google Sheet can contain what’s live without needing to update your ads as promotions and prices fluctuate. The best use-cases are specific to a client, which makes it an interesting discussion, but one that might require the budget (or cost savings) to rationalize the time and effort.
