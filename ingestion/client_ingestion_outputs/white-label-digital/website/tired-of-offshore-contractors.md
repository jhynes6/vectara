## Tired of Offshore Contractors?

If you’ve ever worked with offshore marketing contractors, you’ve probably run into one (or more) of these issues:

– Timezone lags that delay deliverables and feedback loops.

– Communication breakdowns due to language or cultural barriers.

– Freelancers who disappear, miss deadlines, or lack accountability.

– Little visibility into how campaigns are actually being managed.

– A patchwork of tools and third-party platforms you have no control over.

At White Label Digital, we’ve built something better. We are built to function like the internal digital ad team for a brand with a $100,000,000 ad budget, but one which small and mid-sized agencies can plug into. We’re their team “down the hall”, as we often put it, which isn’t far from the truth for those of us who work remotely.

Seasoned experts trusted by the best. We might some day hire interns or maybe dabble in staffing eager, somewhat green talent. For the foreseeable future though, our experts have at least a decade of experience and we’re proud to be a 100% U.S.-based, full-time staff. We’re hands-on problem solvers with expertise across a wide array of ad tactics, strategies, and data solutions. While we only “sell” ad campaign work, we lend critical support pieces like customized reporting, available 24/7. We handle strategy, media planning, tag management, GA4 integration, and attribution modeling. We run all campaigns ourselves, through our own platforms and DSP seats, leveraging our custom scripts, rules, workflows and automation — so nothing gets lost in translation, and nothing is outsourced.

Our goal is to provide clear communication and real-time responsiveness, greater transparency into media buying and performance with real-time reporting, and to drive measurable results. We do that without contracts or retainers, and do our best to avoid budget minimums to maintain adequate support across our agency partners’ portfolios. Whether you’re scaling your paid media or just tired of playing middleman, we’re here to make your life easier — and your campaigns more effective. Our revenue relies on performance and impactful campaigns, and we’re very much OK with that.

_We’re always looking for problems to solve, and we’re happy to show you how we do it. Drop us a line [**here**](https://whitelabeldigital.co/contact/) or email us directly at _info@whitelabeldigital.co_ for more info._
