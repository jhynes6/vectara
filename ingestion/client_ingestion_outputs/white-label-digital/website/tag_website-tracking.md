Changes in privacy and general tech over the last several years have all but completely hampered audience (user) segmentation on the client-side. Meaning, we can’t reliably segment website visitors, such that testing landing pages and conversion funnels no longer lets us ensure that whatever test variation you see first is the only one that you see. You’re in “bucket A” or “bucket B”, but not both. That’s out the window, for the most part, shy of some pretty expensive tools but even then, it’s not really clean. Same goes for creative testing, where the end user is so often behind a veil that you can’t reliably show any particular user only one of your ad creative variations. We’re back to 2005 on this point, where creative testing is still beneficial but a bit of a free-for-all. If you have a favorite plugin, give us a shout (marketing@whitelabeldigital.co), there’s always something new out there and we’d love to hear about it. Don’t let the lack of a handle convince you not to test ad creative or conversion funnels. It’s still important. I like to ask clients, “if you ran a retail store and I could tell you that as people walk-in they’ll see different layouts of your store/products, we’ll monitor which layouts they see over time, and track each layout’s impact on sales. At the end of the test we’ll tell you which layout drives the highest sales per visitor – would you want me to do that?”. The answer is obviously yes, but why people don’t do this with their websites is a mystery. Seems like a giant oversight, to me. Don’t forget that it doesn’t really matter why a color, CTA, headline, or other variation works better than another, it only matters that you know what works best so that you can act on it. Test, implement the winner, repeat, but in small increments and for large volume sites you might consider using a small portion of your site’s traffic as a test pool. You’ll also likely find different “champion” iterations from one channel or traffic source to the next. That’s OK, given the varying level of motivation and familiarity that users have across all of your marketing channels. – _We’re always looking for problems to solve, and we’re happy to show you how we do it.

There’s definitely a correlation between paid ad traffic and organic website visits, starting with users visiting across multiple devices (you found me with an ad on my mobile FB news feed, I’ll be back from my iPad or laptop). There’s also an inability to track some devices or users, that’s just a technical reality. I do believe that GA4 maintains the capacity to accurately show you your “organic search” activity, it’s the “direct” and other nondescript sources in GA4 reports that’ll contain the rest. Consider pulsing your ad campaigns, or looking at the before and after where a client’s ad budget changed dramatically. There’s no single formula here, it takes some sleuthing, and be careful not to discount offline marketing activities as drivers of direct and organic site traffic. In some cases, general market activity can dramatically impact organic site traffic. Still though, take a look and plot organic search and other/direct (sum of all unpaid that are not organic search) over time. Weekly is fine, give yourself a 2 or 3 month window pre- and post budget change. You’ll need to sprinkle some gut feel onto this, related to offline marketing, seasonality, and some other factors. Also, you don’t want to be doing this sort of thing incorrectly or you’ll jerk the wheel into a bridge abutment; find an expert, should you need one. Brand keywords deserve a mention as well, where it can be very interesting to see what happens if you prevent your ads from appearing for your brand’s search queries. Because there is not real “exact match” any more, and Performance Max campaigns have one foot in the SEM space without lending any real controls to us, this can require account-level negatives. If you wanted, you could house your brand keywords and campaigns in an additional Ads Account. With that, you can turn it on, off, up, or down at will, without impacting the other campaigns. This sort of analysis is another reason why I like the use of distinct vanity URLs in direct mail campaigns, as a way to accurately ID the source of that site traffic. Not every digital ad click can be traced (device/browser limitations), and not every direct mail customer will use the vanity URL. Still though, it’s nice to do as much house cleaning as possible. – _We’re always looking for problems to solve, and we’re happy to show you how we do it.

If you’re at an agency, you’ve almost certainly seen clients with websites that you’d suggest they show nobody, ever. We’ve got a couple of digital tactics on-hand for these clients, where we drive people to call or convert without sending anyone to the client’s site. Do what you need to do, in order to monetize the traffic you generate with ad spend, that’s the idea. It’s also a bit of a shock to some clients that simply putting information in an image and showing that image on screens is “job done”. Ads get people’s attention and drive them to a website that needs to convey benefits and CTAs to push the user down a conversion funnel. We’ll also build a website if we truly need one. For one client a few years ago, we spent upwards of $40,000 building a website and custom CMS for evolving coupons and promotions. They were a huge group of franchise owners in the retail space, across the country, without access to track the website managed by headquarters. Even with access, it wasn’t what we needed, so we just built a new site that’d let us offer-up downloadable coupons and spin-up pages & promotions on a dime, all tracked properly. Our pricing model let us simply bake-in that cost, or at least most of it, over the course of the year. No debates, no corralling 800 business owners, no underestimation or confusion \[on the part of the client\] as to the value of having this new website. Do what you need to do, in order to monetize the traffic you generate with ad spend, as always. The concept of monetizing your website visitors, focusing on revenue per visitor, is another reason why we love testing landing pages. The numbers don’t lie, testing works and without an adequate website you just can’t get that done. Consider paid ad landing pages during development and you’ll be able to get the assets that you need for a tiny additional expense to the project. – _We’re always looking for problems to solve, and we’re happy to show you how we do it.

## [What is a Conversion Worth?](https://whitelabeldigital.co/what-is-a-conversion-worth/)

We’ve recently been revisiting the value that we associate to conversion events like phone calls or form completions. Clients with online purchase events are easily handled, once the technical work is done. For most clients though, associating a value to each conversion event can be exceedingly difficult to get right. For every client, it’s worth exploring. We often find ourselves simply offering a calculation to a client that depicts how many of each conversion type we’d expect to see for every $1K in ad spend, for example. What is a conversion, after all? For a typical client, in Google alone, we might have: – Clicks to Call (Google Maps, website) – Calls placed (as tracked by Google Ads call numbers) – Calls over a certain duration (deemed a “conversion” in Google Ads) – Contact forms – Application, Tour, or Calendar bookings – Purchase or Subscription Consider this little problem from a different perspective; it’s less important that you know exactly what a conversion is worth, and more important that you know what each conversion is worth in relation to the other conversions. We often use a scale of 1 to 100 (1-1,000 for larger ticket events). In that scale, with your most valuable conversion being worth “100”, where do the other conversions fall on that scale? Maybe a phone call is worth 1/2 what an online form is worth, and you might ignore calls that come from branded SEM traffic as those are a unique circumstance. Maybe calls over 2 or 3 minutes are worth 100, while shorter calls are worth less. You might also have things like newsletter sign-ups, coupons or white paper downloads, or even sessions over a certain duration. Those little things can be helpful to feed back to ad platforms as signals to help guide ad campaigns, but you’ll need to use them properly or you’ll drive yourself off the rails. Value is only part of the equation, of course. Attribution modeling is a different topic, but applying values and mining the data is important without getting complicated with modeling, cross-channel attribution, and other tricky bits. Keep in mind that this might immediately ID sources of higher value “conversions”, but it also enables testing of value-oriented bid strategies in Google Ads. You’ll want at least a month of value tracking in your data before you test it, but Maximize Conversion Value could help you drive more of the conversions that you really want. To put this another way, if you’re not paying attention to what value you attribute to each conversion event, you’re telling Google Ad that they’re all equal in value. Don’t feel compelled to assign values if you truly can’t ID them with some level of certainty, but at the very least you’ll want to make sure forms and purchases aren’t seen as equal to a phone call or click-based action. – _We’re always looking for problems to solve, and we’re happy to show you how we do it.
