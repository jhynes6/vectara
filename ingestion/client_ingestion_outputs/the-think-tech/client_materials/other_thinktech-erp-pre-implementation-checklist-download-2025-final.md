Define Your
Manufacturing Goals

Before selecting software, map your priorities.

Manufacturers that clearly define goals are 3x more likely to
achieve ROI within 6 months.

Core Manufacturing Objectives:

 ☐ Reduce Lead Time
       Most manufacturers typically see 20-35% improvement
 ☐ Inventory Control
       Ex) Reduce excess by 20-30%
 ☐ Production Planning
       Ex) Increase throughput by 15-25%
 ☐ Quality Control
       Ex) Reduce defects by 10-20%

Establish These 5 Key Metrics:

1. On-Time Delivery: Current __% vs. Target __%

Recommended Benchmark - 95%

2. Inventory Turnover: Current: __x vs. Target __x

Recommended Benchmark - 6-15x annually

3. Production Efficiency: Current: __% vs. Target __x

Recommended Benchmark - 80%+ OEE

4. First-Pass Quality: Current: __% vs. Target __x

Recommended Benchmark - 98%+

5. Cost Reduction: Current: __% vs. Target __x

Recommended Benchmark - 10-20% savings target

Choose the Right
Odoo Modules

Start simple, expand later. Manufacturers benefit
from 3-4 core modules initially.

Essential Starting Modules:

☐ MRP - Production planning and scheduling

☐ Inventory - Real-time stock visibility

☐ Purchase - Vendor management

☐ Maintenance - Equipment tracking

☐ Quality - Quality control processes

☐ Sales - Customer order integration

☐ Accounting - Financial tracking and cost control

Build Your
Implementation Team

For organizations, this often means wearing multiple hats,
that's perfectly fine.

Required Roles (Can Be Combined):

 ☐ Project Owner (Often owner/operations manager)

 ☐ Operations Lead (Shop floor knowledge)

 ☐ Accounting/CFO (Cost tracking)

 ☐ IT Support (May be an external partner like ThinkTech)

Map Your
Current Processes

Leave room for surprises. Most manufacturers typically discover
5-8 critical inefficiencies during this phase.

Document These Workflows:

 ☐ Customer Order → Production → Delivery
 ☐ Material Ordering → Receiving → Usage
 ☐ Production Planning → Execution → Quality
 ☐ Inventory Management → Costing → Reporting

Quick Process Health Check:

Manual processes: __% of daily tasks
Duplicate data entry: __x per order
Inventory accuracy: __%
Order processing time: __ days

Red Flags to Address:

Reliance on excel-based production scheduling
Manual inventory tracking
Disconnected systems requiring double-entry
No real-time visibility into production status

Prepare Your Data

Clean data = successful implementation. Plan for at least
2-3 weeks of data preparation.

Critical Data to Organize:

 ☐ Product Master (SKUs, descriptions, specs)
 ☐ Bill of Materials (Components, quantities, routings)
 ☐ Vendor Information (Contacts, terms, lead times)
 ☐ Customer Data (Contacts, pricing, history)
 ☐ Work Centers (Equipment, capacity, labor rates)
 ☐ Current Inventory (Quantities, locations, costs)

Data Standardization Rules:

Consistent naming (avoid abbreviations)
Standard units (pieces, pounds, inches)
Logical part numbers (create system if none exists)
Clean duplicates (one record per item)

Quick Win
Start with your top 20% of products/customers—
get these perfect first.
