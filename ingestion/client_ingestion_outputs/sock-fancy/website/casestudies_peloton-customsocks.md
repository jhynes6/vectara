When Peloton connected with us, they were seeking a sock that would be perfect for working out and sporting in the office. With a focus on comfort and design, we created a custom athletic ankle sock.

Peloton was able to dress their cycle class instructors in their new custom athletic socks and attract potential new hires at their Culture & Code event at AfroTech 2019.

> "Sock Fancy does excellent branding and the quality of the sock is fantastic!" “Extremely comfortable!”
