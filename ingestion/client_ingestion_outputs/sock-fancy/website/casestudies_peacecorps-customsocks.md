# Peace Corps x Sock Fancy

![Blog Thumbnail](https://framerusercontent.com/images/cW0ek0Ycc3urXwGjcbsO4yXvlc.png)

### Promoting peace with custom gear

The Peace Corps is a service organization for change-makers who want to immerse themselves in a community abroad, working side-by-side with local leaders to tackle the most pressing challenges across the globe.

### A special way to showcase your service

When the Peace Corps originally reached out to us, they wanted to create custom socks that they could use in their online store. With the exchange of just a few emails, we were able to create a sock that perfectly embodied their vision, making a one of a kind design for the even the most worldly of travelers.

Now, they use these socks as a revenue driver on their site, giving people an alternative and uniquely branded way to support their cause. Custom socks and their mix of style and functionality made them a great addition to the Peace Corps online marketplace.

> “Sock Fancy exceeded our expectations. Our community is always looking for ways to show our passion for service & our new custom socks provide a fun and unique way of showing our pride for Peace Corps.”  
> — Glenn Blumhorst, President & CEO Peace Corps
