# Gas South x Sock Fancy

### Branded face masks, for good

Gas South is a leading provider of natural gas that serves more than 300,000 residential and commercial customers in Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, and South Carolina. They are a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cobb EMC, one of the country’s largest electric cooperatives.

Gas South needed branded face masks that would protect their employees and be comfortable to wear in and out of the office. They’re driven by their mission to “be a fuel for good” which includes being active in their communities. We knew it was also important to make sure the face masks fit well as they complete acts of service in their communities.

We took all of their requests into consideration and were able to create the perfect face masks for Gas South. The face masks had a design that reflected their brand, had a secure yet comfortable fit, and protected their employees. Our face masks were a hit with the Gas South team!

> We're loving our face masks. Our employees have been out in the community being a "Fuel for Good," volunteering and giving back to those in need during the pandemic -- all while rocking their branded face masks!"
