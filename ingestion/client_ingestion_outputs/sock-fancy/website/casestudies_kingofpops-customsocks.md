# King of Pops x Sock Fancy

### Showing off their unique flavor with custom socks

King of Pops is an Atlanta based Popsicle company serving up delicious frozen treats to their dedicated fan base all over the southeast. With locations spanning over five states, King of Pops has created a cult-following with their unique flavors, commitment to their community, and drive to create "unexpected moments of happiness" in every pop sold.

We teamed up with King of Pops to create a limited edition custom sock, bringing together a perfectly sweet combination of style, whimsy, and fun. After a couple face to face meetings (perks of both being ATL based!), and one *amazing* tour of the King of Pops facility (pops included!), we were able to design a sock that was just....well, happy.

Inspired by one of our favorite Atlanta brands, we’ve teamed up with King of Pops to create a limited-edition sock, bringing together a perfectly sweet combination of style, whimsy, and fun. Teaming up with King of Pops was an easy decision. Both born and bred in Atlanta, this collaboration was a fun one. This limited-edition sock was dreamed up by combining playful colors with a super fun, but wearable design. These will definitely pop a punch to your regular sock rotation, can you beat that?

King of Pops was able to outfit their whole team in new socks, using these fun pairs as not only a source of revenue, but a promotional item fit for display on their social channels, website, and in storefronts. Custom socks were the perfect fit for this energetic and quirky brand. Now, they use these socks as a revenue driver on their site, giving people an alternative and uniquely branded way to support their cause. Custom socks and their mix of style and functionality made them a great addition to the Peace Corps online marketplace.
