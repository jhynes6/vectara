# Chick-fil-A & Coca-Cola x Sock Fancy

![Blog Thumbnail](https://framerusercontent.com/images/H91YpWywRDHQoN7jgfEi9zuPvs.jpg)

### Socks as good as chicken sandwich

Coca-Cola has reordered custom socks for their annual Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day three years in a row.

Chick-fil-A and Coca Cola are two brands with deep Atlanta roots. A chicken sandwich paired with an ice-cold Coca Cola just can’t be replicated anywhere else or by anyone else. This was a partnership that just made sense.

### Name a better combo... we'll wait

After a long-standing relationship, these two brands decided to team up with us to create a custom sock to use at a Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day event. These socks were a unique item that could be worn (and loved!) by employees of both brands.

Custom socks made perfect sense for the needs of both brands. The decision to bring on a new type of giveaway product was all validated after hearing the overwhelmingly positive employee feedback. In result, custom socks have become the go-to promotional item for this annual co-branded event, two years running.
