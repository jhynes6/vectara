Iconic Supply Co. is a nationwide full-service promotional products company serving clients of all sizes and across all industries. We believe in the transformative potential of promotional products to fuel marketing campaigns, elevate customer relationships, illustrate employee appreciation and drive brand awareness - and we're constantly adding new products and platform strategies to keep ourselves and our clients on the cutting edge of the market.

Brent Mittleman, the founder of Iconic Supply Co., followed the advice of his uncles ("Marv" and "Mitt") to join them in the promotional products industry almost 20 years ago and has never looked back. After climbing through the ranks of a prominent NYC agency and providing instrumental leadership during its acquisition, Brent decided to take his extensive knowledge and experience and step out on his own.

Iconic Supply Co. provides end-to-end expert guidance and services including creative/design consulting, product procurement, screen printing/embroidery/embellishments, overseas and domestic sourcing, product safety testing, e-commerce solutions, kitting, fulfilment and warehousing. Whenever you need promotional products to deliver for your business - **our team will exceed your expectations every step of the way!**

The name Iconic Supply Co. is a tribute to Brent's uncle "Marv" who passed away from cancer before Brent started the new company. Brent was already set to carry on the family tradition but also wanted to personally carry a piece of his uncle's legacy through his new venture. A few months after launching Iconic, cancer would strike again, when Brent and his wife Amiee found out that their young son Julian had been diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a rare form of childhood cancer. To support Julian's heroic path to recovery, and as an ongoing tribute to his uncle, Iconic Supply Co will forever donate a portion of its sales to [Band of Parents](https://p2p.onecause.com/julian) - the leading independent supporter of neuroblastoma research at the world-renowned Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) in NYC - to one day protect other children from the battle that Julian is fighting. Please #BeICONIC and consider donating to help with this important cause.
