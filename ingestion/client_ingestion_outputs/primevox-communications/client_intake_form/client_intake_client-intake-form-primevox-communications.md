Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? What do you do to improve their business?Chiropractors Problems: 
 We’re missing new patient calls when we’re with someone or at lunch. 
 Our phones go to voicemail, and no one checks it fast enough.
 I have no idea how many potential patients we’re losing.
 We don’t have the staff to answer every call, but every missed call costs us.
 We need something better than a basic phone line, but I don’t want a system that’s complicated.
 Primevox Solutions:
 Missed call text-back - automatically sends a text when the front desk can’t answer, so no patient inquiry slips through
 Voicemail transcription + instant alerts - staff sees voicemail content immediately
 Mobile + Desktop Softphones - handle calls anywhere
 Call Recording + Analytics - train new front desk staff, improve service, and track where calls are being dropped or mishandled
 HIPAA-Compliant - secure voice, fax, and SMS tools built with privacy in mind
 Easy Routing & Overflow Handling - set up intelligent call flows so patients always reach a live person or get a follow up
 MSPs Problems:
 Most VoIP vendors take forever to respond and leave us hanging in front of our clients.
 Provisioning phones should be simple. Why is it still a mess with some providers?
 Margins are tight, we need recurring revenue that’s actually worth our time.
 Too many vendors oversell, under deliver, and we take the heat when things break.
 We need flexibility, not rigid packages or support that stops at Tier 1.

 20% lifetime residual - you get paid every month your client stays
 Fast, US-based support - response time under 15 minutes. No overseas call centers.
 Full Provisioning & Admin Portal - add, remove, or reconfigure users in seconds

 You Look Like a Hero - We don’t compete with you. We make you look good, keep your clients happy, and let you grow your recurring revenue without extra work.
 Property Management Problems:
 Calls get dropped or routed to the wrong office, and tenants get frustrated.
 We’ve got people working from multiple locations and can’t keep communication consistent.
 Our staff is mobile, and they’re missing calls they should be handling on the go.
 We don’t have visibility into how calls are being handled across properties.
 We need to be reachable 24/7 for emergencies, but we can’t afford to overstaff phones.
 Primevox Solutions:
 Centralized Call Routing + Overflow Management - route calls based on property, department, or time of day
 Mobile + Desktop Softphones for Field Staff - leasing agents, maintenance techs, and managers stay connected without being tied to a desk
 Call Recording + Analytics - track every conversation, verify service quality, and improve accountability across your team

 24/7 On-Call Routing with Failover - set up escalation rules and backup coverage so critical calls never go unanswered, even after hours
 Scalable Across Locations - add or remove users and locations without reworking your whole system
 Private Schools Problems:
 We miss parent calls during busiest parts of the day, mornings, lunch, and pickup..
 If a call gets routed wrong or dropped, there’s no easy way to know or follow up.
 We don’t have a fast way to notify parents in an emergency or closure.
 Our staff uses personal phones because we don’t have a proper system for mobile communication.
 We’re growing, but our phone system is stuck in the past and hard to scale.
 We don’t have visibility into how front desk staff are handling calls or voicemails.
 Primevox Solutions:
 Smart Call Routing + Auto-Failover - ensure calls reach the right staff (front desk, classrooms, admin) based on time of day or call type
 SMS Alerts + Missed Call Text Back - send real time text updates to parents for emergencies, closures, or quick reminders. Auto-reply when a call is missed, so nothing slips through

 Scalable for Growth - easily add new classrooms or locations as enrollment grows. 

Case Studies and Previous Customer Successes

For each service, what are case studies or recent customer successes that you use to highlight your expertise in your field?
 The customer service is unmatched, and having the same number as my phone and fax number has made things so much easier. I could also go on and on about the ease of use and benefit of using the mobile app to streamline a bunch of our processes with our mail line. Primevox is a must have for any successful practice.
 Dr. Josh Bonine, DC, South Texas Spine & Knee 
 Primevox has the best customer service and we “never” have issues with dropped calls or call quality (from our end). We briefly changed to a different phone service but were back within 6 months. We love the separate app to take/make calls from our cell phones and the auto missed text back is super convenient. Communicating with clients is a breeze! Thank you for keeping us connected, Primevox!
