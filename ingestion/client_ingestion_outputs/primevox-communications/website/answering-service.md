# How it works.

# Directed to answerCare.
### Your business is issued a phone number that is directed to answerCare. After your business closes, callers are forwarded to this phone number.

# Connected to an agent.
### The caller will then reach a customized menu. Depending on the option the caller chooses, they will be connected either to voicemail or an on-call employee.

# Get notified.
### If the on-call employee can't answer, or the caller reaches a voicemail, your team will be notified instantly that an urgent message is awaiting a call back.

## Some of answerCare's awesome features.

# Customized notifications

# Customize the type (SMS/Email/Phone Call) and frequency of notifications your team receives.

# Back up agents
# Set a back up on-call employee if the first fails to return a call within an allotted time.

# Call from your number
# Return calls through answerCare using your business phone number.
