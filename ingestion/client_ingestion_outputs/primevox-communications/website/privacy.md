## 7. Fees
Accessing your Personal Data or exercising any of your rights will not incur a fee. However, if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive, we may charge a reasonable fee or refuse to comply with your request in such circumstances.

## 8. Information We May Need from You  
To confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Data or exercise your other rights, we may need to request specific information from you. This may include your first and last name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, or other necessary information to verify your identity or the authorization of your representative. This is a security measure to prevent unauthorized disclosure of Personal Data. We may also contact you to request further information related to your request for assistance in our response. Any Personal Data provided for verification and fraud prevention will only be used for that purpose and will be deleted as soon as practical after processing your request.

## 9. Timing  
We strive to respond to all legitimate requests within fourteen (14) days of receipt.  However, if your request is particularly complex or if multiple requests have been made, it may take longer to process. In such cases, we will notify you and keep you updated on the progress.

## 10. Appeals  
If we refuse to act on your request, you have the right to appeal that decision. You can contact us at compliance@primevox.net or 972-600-1150 (option 1). We appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns before you escalate the matter to a relevant data protection supervisory authority.

## 11. Retention of Personal Data  
We will retain your Personal Data only for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, reporting requirements or as specifically outlined in this document. If there is a complaint or a prospect of litigation regarding our relationship with you, we may retain your Personal Data for a longer period. The retention period is determined based on factors such as the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of unauthorized use or disclosure, the purposes of processing, alternative means to achieve those purposes, and applicable legal requirements. After the applicable retention periods expire, your Personal Data will be deleted or anonymized. In cases where technical limitations prevent the complete deletion of Personal Data from our systems, appropriate measures will be implemented to prevent further use of such data. We may also aggregate your Personal Data (so that it is no longer personally identifiable) to improve our products and services, and in such cases, we may use the information indefinitely without further notice to you.

## 12. Protection of Personal Data  
Primevox takes precautions, including administrative, technical, and physical measures, to protect against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access to the Personal Data we process or use. However, it is important to note that no provider can guarantee absolute security, especially when services rely on the public internet or involve transmission through interconnected telecommunications networks. You are responsible for safeguarding your account passwords, limiting device access, and signing out of websites after your sessions. Any activity conducted using your credentials or passwords is your responsibility. If you believe your password for any of our websites or systems has been compromised, please notify us immediately at compliance@primevox.com or 972-600-1150 (option 1).

## 13. Linked/Mirrored Websites, Landing Pages & Third-Party Websites  
For your convenience, our websites may transfer you to another website that mirrors our main website or provide a link to a landing page that is controlled by Primevox.  In these instances, our Privacy Policy applies. When we provide you with any hyperlinks to third-party websites, we are not responsible for their privacy practices or companies that we do not own or control. This Privacy Policy does not apply in these instances, and they may collect additional information beyond what we collect on our websites. We do not endorse these third-party sites, their services or products, or the content they contain. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of each third-party site you visit to understand how they collect, use, and protect your information.

## 14. Children  
Our websites, products, and services are not directed to children under the age of 18 in the United States and we do not knowingly collect online Personal Data directly from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your minor child has disclosed Personal Data to us, please contact us at compliance@primevox.net or 972-600-1150 (option 1).

## 15. Changes to this Privacy Policy  
We reserve the right to make corrections or updates to this Privacy Policy at our discretion. When changes occur, we will post the updated Privacy Policy on our website and update the Effective Date. In case of material changes, we will provide a prominent notice at the top of the Privacy Policy for thirty (30) days and/or send a notice to the email address you have provided us. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy.
