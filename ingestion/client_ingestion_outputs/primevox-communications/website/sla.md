## Service Level Agreement (SLA)

Last Updated: 02/26/2024

By using or continuing to use Primevox's services, customers agree to the terms and conditions outlined in this Service Level Agreement (SLA) (“Agreement”).

1. UPTIME

Primevox guarantees 99.999% uptime for its services.

2. PERFORMANCE MONITORING

Primevox employs industry-standard monitoring tools to ensure consistent service performance. Customers can view real-time performance metrics and status updates on our status page at [https://status.primevox.net](https://status.primevox.net).

3. SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE

Periodic maintenance is necessary to ensure optimal service performance. Primevox will provide customers with at least 24 hours of notice prior to any scheduled maintenance that may cause downtime.

4. SERVICE CREDITS

If Primevox fails to meet the 99.999% uptime guarantee, customers will be eligible for service credits calculated using the following straight-line formula:

Service Credit = (99.999% - Actual Uptime) x 50% of Monthly Service Fee

For example, if the actual uptime is 99.7%, the service credit would be calculated as: Service Credit = (99.999% - 99.7%) x 50% of Monthly Service Fee = 0.2% x 50% = 0.1% of Monthly Service Fee

Service credits are capped at a maximum of 50% of the monthly service fee.

5. EXCEPTIONS

5.1. FORCE MAJEURE. Primevox will not be held liable for any failure to meet the uptime guarantee due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to natural disasters, wars, acts of terrorism, government actions, or any other force majeure event.
