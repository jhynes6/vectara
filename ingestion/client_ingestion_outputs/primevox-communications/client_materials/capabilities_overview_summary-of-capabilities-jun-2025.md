Primevox’s patented next-generation AI technology ensures multi-master replication (i.e., all pathways remain active) and always duplicates call data at a minimum of two data centers to eliminate downtime. In contrast, 2nd-generation competitors employ a passive/active approach without duplication, resulting in high downtimes, dropped calls, and slow failover (i.e., call recovery times of 10 minutes to 4 hours). SBC: Session border controller.Virtually infinite horizontal and vertical scalability
is the cornerstone of Primevox’s patented
technology. With little to no on-premises
equipment to fail or become obsolete, and Primevox’s continual efforts to push the limits of
flexibility and functionality, we can easily grow to
meet our customers’ evolving needs.Even with the largest conceivable installation,
customers will not need to increase bandwidth

Integrations/Interoperability

We handle the programming and maintenance of

integrations for our customers at no additional cost.

Primevox can support integration with innumerable

applications (e.g., Google, Microsoft 365) and any

manufacturer device that supports Open Standard

SIP (e.g., Polycom, Grandstream, Cisco, Yealink,

Algo). Our team of software engineers loves to

distribution list via phone or email. Primevox easily

accommodates notifications to multiple emergency

response locations and supports high granularity of

location information conveyed to police when a 911

call is placed.

Uptime and Downtime

of downtime over the last four years.

Primevox can easily program desktop VoIP phones,

softphone apps, and softphone desktop software

to accommodate the specific needs of various

industries and customer types. Options for codes

and customizations are essentially limitless—e.g.,

panic button, lock-down codes, codes that trigger

emergency messages to select groups, speed dial

options—and can be programmed to notify select

individuals and off-site distribution lists.

Connectivity: 911 and Analog
Connections

Our capacity to connect to analog devices is

unlimited. Paging systems, faxes, external ringers,

and other existing analog systems can connect with

the Primevox platform using a Grandstream HT818

ATA device. We also interface with POTS lines,

FXO/FXS, and other analog systems for 911 calling/

survivability, including two-way radio integration

using an analog interface and emergency response

email notifications. These devices interface with

Primevox’s system via Open Standard SIP, with

on-premise connectivity via FXS or FXO ports for

analog devices.

Emergency calls and emails can be placed by all of

a customer’s employees using Primevox’s softphone

or desktop apps and can be programmed to notify

select individuals in real time as well as an off-site

Failover

Because all data pathways in the Primevox system

are always active (Figure 1), failover is near-

instantaneous and undetectable by Primevox users.

If another carrier experiences an outage, and their

back-up system is active, Primevox automatically

reinvites the carrier back to the call with a high

success rate. If a user’s phone dies, Primevox will

reinvite the call six times.

Disaster Recovery and Redundancy

In terms of disaster recovery, the Primevox platform

replicates data at five geographically separated

data centers (Figure 1), which is virtualized using

the VMWare platform. Primevox can securely store

unlimited quantities of data using TLS-encrypted,

HIPAA-compliant Amazon S3 Object Storage. Data

can be stored for up to two years. Utilizing an odd

number of geographically disparate set of data

centers, uptime is guaranteed as long as a majority

of data centers are online (i.e., the “majority

quorum”) to maintain proper AI and cluster

operations. In 9 years of operating this

revolutionary system, the majority quorum has

never been lost.

Data Storage Capabilities

Primevox data is stored using encrypted Amazon

S3 object storage and can be stored for up to 2

years. As storage capabilities are infinite, Primevox

can easily meet customers’ data storage, retention,

and monitoring requirement needs for thousands

of users, and needs can be adjusted on a site-

by-site basis. The two-year data retention period

can be extended and customized, as our platform

is built in-house and is therefore easy for us to

make enhancements. Data retention can be set

differently for digital faxes, voicemail messages, call

recordings, etc.

We have hired, on a yearly basis, a 3rd party

compliance and security company to audit our

company business practices and technical practices

to ensure HIPAA compliance, which ensures data is

encrypted and stored/transmitted securely.

Contact/Call Centers

Primevox can create unlimited contact/call centers

as needed to meet our customers’ needs. In line

with Primevox’s commitment not to nickel and

dime our customers, a plethora of contact center

features are built into our platform and all included

in our base price (Table 2) . These include ACD

queues (e.g., ring all, linear, least-recent, least-calls,

random, round-robin), skills-based routing, agent

login/logout tracking, real-time and historical queue

analytics, and unlimited agent/supervisor and

dashboards.

In addition, the following AI features are available

in our call center suite: sentiment analysis, which

analyzes the happiness or anger of a customer

throughout the call to determine how satisfied

a customer is with the agent’s service; agent

coaching, which offers the agent tips on how to

improve future calls; call summarization, which

summarize the call in 5 talking points; and action

item generation, which extracts actionable items

from the call (e.g., “don’t forget to email the

customer”, “offer that discount to them on their

next billing cycle”).
