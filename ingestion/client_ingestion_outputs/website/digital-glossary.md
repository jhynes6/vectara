# Digital Glossary for Marketers & Website Managers

DIGITAL GLOSSARY An FAQ for Digital Marketing Terms This Isn’t Your Typical FAQ Section The Pitch Of course, you can just Google these terms and get an answer. But a lot of what you’ll find elsewhere on the Web is either written for pros who already understand basic terminology, or it’s written for consumer product businesses or online retailers. Our “glossary” features straightforward descriptions of popular digital marketing terms and technologies, for people who may never have heard any of these terms before. We’re Big Evangelists of Digital Marketing for B-to-B Companies So we’ve oriented our glossary, for the most part, for business to business practitioners. Digital Marketing is constantly evolving. That’s what makes it exciting. At the same time it makes it really challenging to keep up. Between new technologies, evolving marketing tactics & new terminology, it’s hard enough for an agency to stay on top of it all. It’s even more difficult for marketers who are focused on their own business needs. Please feel free to give us feedback. If you have questions, let us know!
