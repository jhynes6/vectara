# Corporate Branding & Brand Development Services

CAPABILITIES Brand & Messaging Development CAPABILITIES Connect Your Brand with Your Customers Great branding is about giving customers a reason to believe. Selling your products and services takes more than low prices and great features. In this competitive marketplace connecting with customers is a priority. If you want them to care about your brand you need to do two things; make an emotional connection and create a meaningful experience. Using a process we call the Brand Discovery Workshop , we focus key stakeholders from a variety of disciplines on your organization, its products and services, mission, and public perception in order to reach consensus on critical brand issues. We facilitate the discussions, adding insight as well as act as the “sounding board” and mediators. Once we’ve gained the required knowledge we can help you: Launch a new brand or product Create brand messaging Rebrand your organization Ensure brand consistency Brand or Product Launch Ready to introduce your brand or a new product to the world? Together, we’ll develop the voice, visual identity, and story for the outside world (and your internal teams too) that will bring your brand to life. Then, we’ll design a strategy to position your brand and define the marketing tactics you will need to engage your customers. Want to see an example?

Brand Messaging & Positioning In marketplaces cluttered with similar offerings, brands struggle to connect with customers. Our process uncovers customer pain points while identifying what makes you unique compared to your top competitors. With this information, we develop messaging that communicates your value proposition to your audience in order to cut through the digital noise and increase brand awareness. Rebranding to Revitalize Your Image Sometimes your visual identity or logo can make your organization seem “behind the times,” or maybe it’s just too similar to your competition. Our branding strategists can help to make your brand unique, meaningful, and relevant. Ensuring Brand Consistency A key challenge post-branding is maintaining a brand’s consistency in its tone, message, and visual representation. To do this, we develop brand guidelines so you can effectively manage your brand moving forward. This ensures that everyone in your organization (from sales to customer service to management) speaks about the company in the same way.
