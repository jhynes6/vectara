Category: Social Media The Importance of Intentional Planning Over Random Acts of Content Posted on July 22, 2025 July 22, 2025 by Keith Rasmussen Strategy Trumps Volume in the Pursuit of Digital Marketing Success Algorithms that reward consistency, competitors who seem to post ceaselessly, and anecdotes from other marketers of plummeting engagement after short periods of social media silence have all amped up the pressure on businesses to post as often as possible. This compulsion is not unfounded—posting frequently can keep you top-of-mind with consumers and earn you some favorability with activity-based algorithms. But without thorough, intentional, data-driven planning, your content marketing will fail to deliver results. The Problem with Tactics Without Strategy When it comes to generating content for social media, it can be difficult to know where to begin. Many businesses look to trends, competitors, and legacy advice as they develop copy and media. The development process itself is time-consuming, and when it is done without guiding insights, it can yield inconsistent messaging, failing to capture appropriate audiences. Unfocused content with random (versus tactical) calls-to-action lacks clear Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). This makes ROI impossible to track, perpetuating a cycle of uninformed, ineffective media creation. Ultimately, high-volume content creation without strategy wastes valuable resources, from employee time to marketing budgets. Frequent, inefficient posts can even have adverse effects such as diluting brand messaging and creating a perception of spam. Why Strategy is Non-Negotiable Data-driven strategy ensures the most efficient use of your resources while maximizing target outcomes. In order for a campaign or platform presence to be successful, there must be established, clear metrics for said success. Once measurable goals, KPIs, and target audiences have been identified, research can be done to determine which channels and media types will yield the highest impact.

Posted in Digital Marketing , Social Media The Top Marketing Challenges of 2024: Insights & Strategies Posted on July 18, 2024 April 2, 2025 by Scott Holmes The Top Marketing Challenges of 2024 What’s Keeping Marketers Up at Night? In a survey conducted by D2 Creative, more than 100 marketers have identified several key challenges for the upcoming year: Navigating the Lead Funnel Lead generation emerges as the top concern, and with good reason as form submissions and the acquisition of new leads tends to be the prime indicator of success in a digital campaign. To address this, we advise marketers to adopt an omnichannel approach, leveraging social media, email marketing, webinars, events, pay-per-click advertising , and AI-driven automation to nurture leads and drive conversions. Personalization remains crucial, with tailored content, targeted ads, customized emails, and individualized offers proving effective in engaging diverse audiences. Content Creation Another significant challenge revolves around creating compelling content. We urge marketers to focus on providing educational and informative materials that address specific pain points and informational needs of their target audience. This includes deploying multimedia formats such as videos, infographics, podcasts, and interactive content to cater to various consumer preferences. Implementing robust search engine optimization (SEO) strategies is also recommended to enhance content visibility and attract organic traffic. Finally, user-generated content can further bolster community engagement and add credibility to brand messaging. Proving ROI Demonstrating return on investment was the third top critical concern for marketers. To effectively measure and showcase ROI, it’s essential to establish clear marketing objectives aligned with broader business goals. Defining key performance indicators (KPIs) such as lead generation metrics, website traffic, conversion rates, customer acquisition costs, and customer lifetime value provides a structured framework for evaluation. Advanced analytics tools and multi-touch attribution models are invaluable for tracking and attributing conversions across various stages of the customer journey, from initial awareness to retention, thereby offering a comprehensive view of marketing effectiveness.

Posted in Digital Marketing , Social Media Tagged Branding Design & Development Social Media Platforms Cheat Sheets Posted on May 29, 2024 January 22, 2025 by Scott Holmes Is Your Social Media Strategy One-Size-Fits-None? LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, and all of those other platforms are the same, aren’t they? You post pictures and videos. You comment. You “like”. You “friend”. So that must mean you can create one piece of content and blast it across all of your channels, right? No. Please don’t do that. The average person uses 6 or more different social media platforms per month , and are on each one for, generally, a different reason. They’re not looking to all those different platforms for the same content. Their behavior on each platform varies, and so does what they want to see across different platforms. As a brand, you’re not expected to create content like a user but you are expected to create content for users , so keeping your target audiences’ preferences top of mind should be key to your overall content development process. There are several pieces to consider when creating content , including what content usually looks like on the platform and what users are expecting of your channel. These expectations should form the foundation of your content strategy for each platform. For instance, users on Instagram are looking to be inspired and entertained. The content they consume generally falls in the buckets of aspirational, luxury, culture, and personal vlogging, and the easier it is to consume and engage with the better. Instead of leaning heavily or only on a feed of posts, develop 2 to 3 Story slides, including engagement stickers that users can quickly interact with as they thumb through. Want a head start on creating the right content for all your channels? Check out our Social Media Platforms Content Cheat Sheet . With insights into user behavior, content preferences, and even how often you should be posting, this high-level outline will help you understand what you should be keeping in mind when developing truly engaging posts.

Posted in Digital Marketing , Social Media Tagged Branding Design & Development Content Pillars: The Secret to Content Marketing Consistency Posted on June 8, 2023 October 9, 2024 by Scott Holmes Whether for advertisements, social media, emails, or just about anything else the question always comes up: “How can I maintain a consistent, and quality stream of content for my brand?” As a digital marketing and communications agency, one of the strategies we’ve found works best is creating content pillars. Content pillars are a strategic approach to organizing and planning content for your brand. They are a set of overarching topics representing the key themes or messages you want to communicate to your audience. Organizing your content around a set of content pillars allows you to create a cohesive content strategy that supports your overall marketing objectives. This approach ensures that your content is aligned with your goals and consistently delivers value to your audience. Creating Effective Content Pillars Here are some tips for building a content pillar strategy that works: Define your brand’s core values and mission . Your content pillars should be aligned with what’s most important to your brand. Consider what sets your brand apart from others and what messages you want to communicate to your audience. Conduct research . Find out what your audience’s needs, interests, and pain points are, then use this information to build content pillars that will resonate with them. Choose 3-5 overarching topics . The topics you choose for your pillars should represent your brand’s key themes or messages. Make sure they’re broad enough to allow for a variety of content types but specific enough to keep your content focused and consistent. Develop a content plan . Once you’ve established your content pillars, develop a content plan that aligns with each one. The topics/themes of the pillars will inform the types of content to create for each pillar and the channels you will use to distribute it. You can also create pillars by channel or platform. For example, we frequently create content pillars for social media content. This helps maintain a steady stream of monthly topics and ensures the most important ones are always covered in a long social media calendar. Evaluate and adjust . Monitor your content strategy regularly to confirm that it’s performing well with your target audience. Don’t hesitate to adjust your content pillars as needed to keep them relevant and effective. You’ll be able to measure which pillars are driving the most traffic and engagement, and which need your attention. Get Started with Content Pillars We share the goal of creating a cohesive and effective content strategy that drives results for your brand, and there’s even more that’s possible after first taking the time to fine-tune the pillars supporting it. If you need a hand getting started or honing your content pillars, we’re available to help. Posted in Digital Marketing , Social Media Common Social Media Marketing Mistakes to Avoid Posted on April 28, 2023 May 5, 2025 by Scott Holmes Is Your Brand Making These Common Social Media Mistakes? Navigating social media as a marketing tool can be a complex and ever-evolving task, and even the most skilled social media managers can face challenges along the way. We’ve identified some common areas where companies may struggle to effectively connect with their audience on social media and outlined them below. Not Engaging with Your Community Too many marketers neglect the social part of social media, treating it as just another sales channel rather than a place to connect with their audience. This kind of thinking leads social media managers to ignore comments and questions, missing opportunities to participate in relevant conversations. When you don’t engage with your followers, it makes your brand seem cold and uninterested in them, which keeps you from making real connections Ignoring the Potential of User-Generated Content (UGC) If your brand isn’t tapping into UGC, it could be missing out on chances to foster higher trust and engagement. Need proof? Just look at companies like GoPro. In 2018, they took a chance on UGC by not just posting people’s GoPro-recorded clips to their own social media accounts, but giving the best submissions a chance to win money. With over 20 million new Instagram followers and a pipeline to easily supplement in-house content with high-quality videos from their users, their gamble quickly became a prime example of the power of UGC. Focusing Too Much on Sales Something we as digital marketers notice frequently is when accounts focus too much on sales. People can easily recognize content that’s trying to sell them something, and they will quickly tune you out if that’s all you give them. Instead, try to balance sales-focused posts with content that’s relevant and interesting to your followers. Providing value to your followers by sharing helpful information, tips, advice, and even humor makes your social media presence more enticing to follow, which, in turn, has a strong potential to lead to influencing sales. Not Optimizing to Your Platform and Audience It’s important to remember social media strategies aren’t one-size-fits-all. You have to remain aware of the audience you’re trying to reach and the etiquette for each platform in order to make a real impact. For example, on X (formerly Twitter), people expect short, to-the-point updates, while Instagram is a visual-first platform where users engage with longer posts, including lengthy reels, carousels, and post captions. Many company and brand accounts also tend to ignore or underuse powerful tools like Instagram Reels or LinkedIn Articles. Branching out into these less static forms of posting gives you new avenues to reach your audience. For regular updates on platform best practices, you can follow D2 Creative on LinkedIn .

You can download it here . Basing Strategies on Instinct, not Performance Too many marketers base strategies on what feels right, rather than what’s proven to work. From engagement statistics to follower demographics, social media sites readily provide profile owners with in-depth data on how and why posts perform—so use it! This means tracking your results and using them to determine what’s working and what isn’t so you can make informed decisions about your social media marketing. By ignoring this data, you put yourself at risk of wasting time and money on ineffective strategies. Not Being Prepared for Emergencies Accidents happen to everyone, but they can become a bigger issue if hundreds or thousands of people see them. Something we come across far too often is companies not having procedures or trained staff ready to deal with poorly received posts or viral negative comments. These issues can lead to PR nightmares that only get worse as they’re ignored or handled improperly. Tips for Success Social media marketing can be a powerful tool for businesses to connect with their audience and build brand awareness, but it requires careful consideration and execution. To avoid these pitfalls and create an effective social media strategy, it’s essential to prioritize engagement and build real connections with your audience. This means responding to comments and questions, sharing valuable content that resonates with your followers, and keeping on top of the norms and opportunities unique to each platform. Regularly analyzing performance data and post reception to adjust strategies accordingly is also key. Most social platforms provide a wealth of analytics themselves, but if you want to go the extra mile, you can get even more in-depth data into what people are saying about your brand by using a social listening tool such as Mention. Collecting this data can help you narrow down post content to what really works and ensure that you’re getting the most out of your social media efforts. Lastly, remember that authenticity is key. Stay true to your brand voice and values, and don’t try to force a particular social media persona that doesn’t align with who you are as a company. With these tips in mind, social media managers can overcome common challenges and create a successful social media presence that connects with their audience and drives business results. Posted in Social Media 6 Strategies to Elevate Your Brand’s Social Media Presence Posted on March 22, 2023 March 19, 2025 by Kenny Oyewole Your Roadmap Starts Here Social media is a dynamic mix of innovation, cultural shifts, and audience expectations. To thrive, brands must blend agility with authenticity, leveraging tools like AI for research and social listening while staying grounded in human-centric strategies. Here’s your roadmap: 1. Sharpen Your Cross-Platform Brand Identity Your voice, visuals, and values should adapt to each platform without losing cohesion, especially in immersive formats like AR or virtual spaces. Why this works: A unified yet flexible brand identity builds trust and recognition across platforms while allowing you to meet audiences where they are. You respect user expectations without diluting your core message by tailoring your voice and visuals to suit each platform’s culture (e.g., playful on TikTok, polished on LinkedIn). You may be thinking, “Does this mean my life sciences organization should be on TikTok?” check out our social media white paper for the top channels we recommend for the industry, and how to optimize your presence on each one. 2. Craft Immersive, Data-Informed Content Merge creativity with insights: Launch AR filters for interactive demos (e.g., “test drive” a device via Instagram Reels). Lean into sustainability storytelling (e.g., Pinterest’s zero-waste DIY guides). Develop hyper-personalized video playlists using AI-driven viewer behavior analysis (e.g., TikTok’s “For You” style tutorials based on past engagement). Why this works: Personalized content tailored to audience preferences boosts relevance and retention. Pairing AI tools with creative formats ensures your content feels data-smart and human-centric. 3. Balance Automation with Human Connection Automation streamlines efficiency, but human connection builds loyalty; striking the right balance ensures your brand scales without losing its soul. Deploy chatbots for FAQs (e.g., Meta AI in Messenger) but reserve nuanced interactions for your team. Host live Q&As on TikTok or Instagram, or AMAs on Reddit to spark real-time dialogue. Why this works: By blending AI’s 24/7 availability with curated human interactions, you cater to modern audiences who crave both convenience and authentic relationships. 4. Target Niche Communities with Smart Tagging Ditch generic hashtags. Use platform-specific and/or AI tools to research trending phrases tied to micro-communities. Why this works: Generic hashtags drown your content in a sea of competition, while hyper-targeted hashtags act as a beacon for niche audiences already passionate about your topic. Platform algorithms generally reward relevance, helping you build authority in specific spaces without appearing spammy. 5. Collaborate with Micro-Creators & Digital Personalities Micro-creators and digital personalities offer hyper-targeted reach and fresh creativity. Partnering with them bridges authenticity with innovation in crowded landscapes. Why this works: Micro-creators thrive in niche communities, driving higher engagement than macro-influencers by fostering trust through relatable, unfiltered content. Digital personalities attract Gen Z and tech-forward audiences with stylized storytelling, while user-generated campaigns (like AR template challenges) turn followers into co-creators. Pairing real creators with virtual counterparts caters to diverse audience preferences while keeping campaigns cost-effective. 6. Optimize with Real-Time, Human-Reviewed Analytics Track metrics that matter. Data tells the story, but context gives it meaning. Combining real-time analytics with human oversight turns numbers into actionable strategies that drive growth and trust. Why this works: Real-time analytics tools (e.g., AI dashboards) surface trends instantly, letting you pivot campaigns mid-flight to maximize ROI. However, human review adds critical context. Build a Social Strategy That Lasts Social media users demand a balance of innovation and humanity. Invest in platforms that align with your audience’s values and use tools like AI as a supplement, not a replacement, for creativity. For tactical guidance, explore our social media cheat sheets , as well as our latest social media whitepaper. Remember, technology evolves, but trust is timeless. Stay adaptable, stay authentic, and always put your community first. Posted in Digital Marketing , Social Media Tagged Social Media , Digital Marketing Page Builder Pros & Cons Your Company Needs to Know Posted on August 29, 2022 June 2, 2025 by Scott Holmes Page Builder Pros & Cons Your Company Needs to Know Building a website can be daunting, even when using a content management system. That’s why page builders like Elementor are commonly seen at the top of plugin lists. These tools offer a different, and hopefully easier approach to creating and managing web pages in WordPress, but they aren’t for everyone. After building many WordPress sites, for many different companies over the years, we’ve learned that these tools don’t make sense for every website. Want to know if a page builder is right for you? Here’s a list of things you should be considering before you download one for your website project: Page builders trade one learning curve for another WordPress’ Gutenberg page editor is powerful enough to make brilliant web pages on its own, but publishing pages in it can take some getting used to. Page builders come with a variety of widgets, functions pre-made styling options, and a visual interface that lets users select some page elements by simply dragging and dropping them. However, that doesn’t mean they don’t take time to learn. If your publishers aren’t used to the technology, they will have to spend time researching and experimenting to effectively use the tool while avoiding unintended changes in functionality or presentation. Page builders don’t always save time Depending on the amount of tweaking you need, to get things exactly the way you want them, a page builder might just increase the work effort. For example, some styling options in page builders are often hard-coded, which limits flexibility. This means that you may have to add in-line custom styles, to pages and content, if you find the in-built options aren’t aligned with your designs. Even if the built-in options are acceptable, specific layouts must often be manually applied to each page instead of having a template that can be used across multiple pages. Editing of responsive content is streamlined Some page builders, like Elementor, have options to see how your page will look on different device types and screen sizes, and even give developers the ability to live edit the breakpoints where different UI layouts appear. This can be extremely helpful when publishing content for a responsive website, as it allows you to see areas where your design might break on mobile devices and fix them on the fly. Reliance on plugins can impact site performance and stability Because plugins come with the code necessary to support all of the page builder’s functionality, page speed and load time can be negatively impacted even though all of the functionality might not be utilized for a specific website. This can impact user experience for both site visitors ( which can hurt your page’s search rankings ) and site editors. Additionally, plugins must be regularly updated to ensure that the latest security updates and bug fixes have been incorporated. Page builders make development knowledge a plus, not a requirement While there’s a lot you can do in WordPress’ “classic” and Gutenberg page editors, having at least a baseline knowledge of HTML code will eventually be a necessity to make your site look and function the way you want. With a page builder, most functions are supported by easy-to-use browser-based tools that require little to no HTML code knowledge. That said, some experience is still quite helpful and will assist users with understanding all the tools available, as many options are described in ways that a developer would more readily understand. This experience also comes in handy for more complex sites, which may require inserting additional scripts that don’t normally exist in the page builder. Our Final Thoughts on Using Page Builders In website development, there is no “one size fits all” approach, so the decision to use a page builder is a choice that should be made on a case-by-case basis. For a larger site with multiple designs that change page to page, a tool like Elementor can help streamline the process of creating each one. However, for small sites or ones that only need a single layout across multiple pages, the benefits associated with using a page builder, as opposed to the “classic” or Gutenberg WordPress editors, may never be realized. Making the right technology choice early on will help ensure that you hit the ground running when the site launches. Careful consideration of your users’ needs (both external and internal), as well as your site’s functional requirements (at launch and in the future), is imperative for determining whether a page builder will truly work for you. There will be times when WordPress, “out-of-the-box”, is perfect for your needs, but be mindful of the limitations of that approach. A properly implemented page builder solution may provide the suite of tools needed to make future maintenance and enhancements a lot less challenging. Posted in Digital Marketing , Social Media
