# Digital Marketing Content Development & Strategy Support

CAPABILITIES Content Development and Marketing CAPABILITIES Creating & Publishing Content Like most marketers, you probably aren’t short on ideas – just short on time. To make matters worse, there is no such thing as “finished” in the digital world. Constant improvement and enhancement are the norm. Updating the content on your site every 4-6 months is not an effective approach. While our clients universally understand the value and importance of continuing to create content, they often struggle to consistently produce and publish it. D2 can help. We work with your team to identify and generate content for your website, blog, or social media accounts to give it the attention it needs. We’ll review the materials you have and learn about your business and customers, then craft a content and ongoing publishing plan that will keep you ahead of the competition.
