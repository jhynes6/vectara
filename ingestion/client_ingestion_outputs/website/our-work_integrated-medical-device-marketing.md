# Integrated Omnichannel Campaign Marketing for Medical Device Visibility

Mizuho OSI Improving Brand Visibility with Integrated, Omnichannel Marketing Campaign Development , Digital Marketing The Challenge Our Approach The Result Mizuho OSI, a leader in surgical equipment, sought to raise awareness for one of its innovative brands. Their Levó® Head Positioning System gave surgeons state-of-the-art speed, precision, and control when positioning a patient’s head for surgery. However, the device struggled to reach the same degree of market awareness as Mizuho OSI’s other products. Our objective was clear: Break into the medical community with a compelling integrated campaign that not only educated, but inspired surgeons to consider and adopt this revolutionary product. We knew a product as revolutionary as Levó needed a campaign to match, so we got to work crafting an omnichannel, digital-first marketing strategy. We started with an in-depth discovery process to discover the core attributes of Mizuho OSI and the product. During discovery, innovation quickly emerged as one of the central values of their brand, not just in how they position themselves, but how their audience of specialized surgeons view them as well. These insights led to our campaign concept: Levólution . Drawing on both the groundbreaking benefits of the Levó and Mizuho OSI’s reputation for enabling safer, more effective treatments, we positioned this brand as something that transformed how surgeons approach patient care. This campaign was brought to life with a mix of static and animated visuals that highlighted Levó’s smooth motion, technological superiority, and unparalleled precision. The Levólution campaign spanned multiple platforms and channels to maximize reach and engagement, including paid search ads, programmatic display ads, LinkedIn posts, email marketing, and direct mail postcards. With rigorous A/B testing and adjustments throughout the campaign, we succeeded in reaching and directing Mizuho OSI’s audience to a campaign landing page. This dedicated site was a cohesive destination that drove home the benefits of Levó with videos, an ROI calculator, and a contact form to support lead generation. In just six months, this campaign delivered exceptional results for Mizuho OSI, but perhaps more important was the impact those results, and the campaign itself, had on their strategy and approach to marketing. Like the Levó, the Levólution campaign was a revolution in how Mizuho OSI engaged with its audience and elevated its brand. Over the course of this campaign, they saw first-hand the tangible results and ROI that were possible with digital-first strategies like Levólution, opening the door to further digital growth and opportunities like it in the future. This impact was recognized industry-wide when the campaign won a 2025 Vega Silver Award for Best Integrated Campaign —a testament to its innovation and effectiveness.
