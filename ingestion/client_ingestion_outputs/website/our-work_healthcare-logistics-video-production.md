# Healthcare Logistics Video Development for an Updated Brand

TRIOSE Engaging Video Campaigns for a Fresh Brand Video Production & Storytelling The Challenge Our Approach The Result With TRIOSE’s new branding successfully established, the next step was building awareness. The client needed an exciting way to show healthcare systems what TRIOSE was capable of, and so our “What If” campaign video was naturally the next step. Our goal was to create a video that could show audiences what made TRIOSE the right choice for today’s industry by capturing the story of TRIOSE and the ways its services could help companies answer their own “What Ifs.” The question-and-answer format of our campaign combined with our newly created brand identity and positioning allowed us to create an engaging video that could deliver both broad and solution-focused messaging. Additionally, the multi-segment nature of the video made it even more useful for reinforcing the benefits of TRIOSE’s various solutions. Each segment of the video could be cut down into a smaller, solution-focused snippet. This meant that while the video in its entirety promoted overall awareness, specific parts of it could be used to build out TRIOSE’s library of product-specific content for the accompanying ad campaign on multiple social platforms. The expanded video library gave TRIOSE a new way to share its offerings and story with a wider range of people. Combined with the digital marketing campaign, the videos put more eyes on the new and improved TRIOSE brand and helped them to stand out in their crowded industry—with production quality worthy of a Super Bowl spot.
