Demand for medical devices and supplies skyrocketed as healthcare providers around the world scrambled to equip themselves with the necessary resources to treat and care for the increasing number of patients infected with the virus. Hospital beds, ventilators, and personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks, gowns and gloves, were in high demand, leading to rapid growth in the market. In addition, demand for medical imaging devices, such as X-rays, CT scanners, and MRI machines, increased as healthcare providers sought to diagnose patients faster and with greater accuracy. This surge in demand caused a shortage of medical devices in some parts of the world, leading to higher prices and longer lead times for orders. The pandemic has also accelerated the development and adoption of digital health solutions, such as telemedicine and remote patient monitoring, to enable healthcare providers to provide care to patients in a safe and efficient manner. The rapid adoption of digital technologies has transformed the way healthcare providers interact with patients and medical device brands.
