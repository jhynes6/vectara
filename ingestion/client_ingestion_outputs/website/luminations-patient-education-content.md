# Patient Educational Content for Various Disease States

Skip to content BLOG Making Patient Education More Memorable and Less Complex Luminations By Ashley Hemenway , Advocacy Outreach Coordinator & Copywriter Empowering Patients Through Accessible Science:
The Luminations Approach to Health Education Navigating complex medical information can feel overwhelming for patients, especially after a serious diagnosis. Enter Luminations : a groundbreaking approach to patient education that transforms abstract science into engaging, easy-to-digest animated videos. Designed to empower patients and caregivers, Luminations combines creativity with clarity to demystify even the most intimidating topics. What are Luminations? Luminations are bite-sized, shareable animations crafted to simplify complex scientific concepts. Born from a need to make dense medical information palatable, the concept for Luminations originated during the development of an e-learning program for pharmaceutical sales representatives. Recognizing the storytelling format’s potential for patient education, our team partnered with advocacy groups to adapt this approach for those who need it most: patients facing life-altering diagnoses. By blending vivid storytelling with hand-drawn animation, Luminations turns cellular processes, biomarkers, and treatment mechanisms into visual narratives that resonate with broad audiences emotionally and intellectually. Why Animation Works: Bridging Knowledge and Emotion A serious diagnosis often triggers emotional turbulence, making it difficult for patients to absorb critical information. Luminations tackles this challenge head-on by creating a safe, approachable space for learning. Here’s how: Lighthearted Storytelling: Characters like mischievous cancer cells or heroic antibodies add whimsy to science, reducing fear without trivializing the disease. Humor is carefully directed at harmful biological elements, ensuring patients feel empowered, not alienated. Visual Metaphors: Abstract ideas, such as how Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs) target cancer cells, are grounded in relatable imagery. For example, a video might depict ADCs as “smart missiles” seeking out diseased cells, making the science instantly understandable. Emotional Relief: By diffusing tension through animation, patients are more likely to engage with content. Our collaboration with CancerCare exemplifies this approach. Their video library includes explainers on topics like the role of the TROP2 biomarker in cancer , using animation to break down intricate science in under two minutes. What Sets Luminations Apart? While many animated patient videos exist, Luminations stand out through two key pillars: Custom Hand-Drawn Artistry: Unlike cookie-cutter animations built from drag-and-drop templates, every Luminations video is hand-crafted by animators. This flexibility allows us (and our collaborators) to depict any scenario, from cellular interactions to large-scale disease mechanisms. Metaphors That Stick: By anchoring foreign concepts to familiar references (e.g., depicting immune cells as “security guards”), the content becomes memorable. Patients don’t just learn—they retain and apply knowledge. Beyond Patient Education: A Tool for Broader Audiences While Luminations excel at educating patients, their applications extend further: Clinical Trials: Simplify recruitment by explaining trial protocols with clarity. Healthcare Providers : Adapt videos to train clinicians on new therapies or healthcare delivery concepts . Investor Communications: Translate groundbreaking science into compelling stories for stakeholders. See the Science Come to Life From partnerships with Stand Up to Cancer and the Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation to projects with industry leaders like Pfizer , Luminations has redefined health communication. Our growing library proves that even the most daunting topics can become accessible (and even inspiring). Ready to explore?
