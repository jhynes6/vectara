    ## Darcie Bobrowski
    CRME, CHRM Owner
    Darcie’s journey in hospitality began early—at just 12 years old, she owned and operated her first vending machine inside her family’s hotel. As a teenager, she worked the front desk and quickly developed a deep understanding of hotel operations. After earning her degree, she took on the challenge of building and managing a new hotel for her family—turning it into a highly successful property.
    
    Long before "revenue management" became a formal discipline, Darcie was already applying its principles to maximize profitability. Her strategic mindset and results-driven approach caught the attention of Warren Resort Hotels, who acquired her family’s hotel. Darcie then stepped into the role of Regional Manager, overseeing both operations and revenue management for a diverse portfolio that included IHG, Best Western, Choice Hotels, and Hilton brands.
    
    In 2020, Darcie co-founded RevDynamic Services, LLC—a company dedicated to providing revenue, operations, and sales support for hotels in the upper-midscale to economy sectors, across both branded and independent properties. Building on that success, she launched her own firm in 2025: **Summit Revenue Management**.
    
    Darcie is a Certified Hospitality Revenue Manager (CHRM) through AHLEI, a Certified Revenue Management Executive (CRME) with HSMAI, and holds additional certifications from IHG and Best Western (BestREV). Her extensive experience, industry knowledge, and passion for driving performance have helped countless properties improve profitability and streamline operations.
    
    She holds a Bachelor of Arts in Business Management and Human Relations from Doane College. When she’s not optimizing hotel revenue, you’ll find her outdoors—hiking, skiing, or enjoying time with her family in the sunshine.

    ## Justin Bleth
    CRME, CHSP, CFBE Portfolio Revenue Manager
    Justin is a seasoned hotelier with over 12 years of experience in the hospitality industry. Hailing from the Pacific Northwest, he spent the bulk of his hotel career working for a full service independent property in Vancouver, Washington. Working his way up from his starting point at the front desk, he became the Director of Operations for the hotel in 2017 until 2022, where he oversaw the revenue strategy and led the day to day operations.
    
    He progressed into the role of Corporate Director of Operations for the hotel's property management company. There, he gained multi-property experience with several branded and independent properties, including IHG, Wyndham, and Choice Hotels. He was responsible for leading and mentoring property General Managers, aiding revenue strategies and budget development and implementation.
    
    Justin is loyal to his alma mater, Washington State University (Go Cougs!), where he obtained dual Bachelor of Arts Degrees in Criminal Justice and Foreign Languages & Cultures. He recently relocated to the east coast of Florida with his wife Josie and two children, Lincoln and Lorelei. Justin enjoys camping, fishing, firepits and making memories with friends and family.
