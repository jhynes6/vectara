### Sales Support

Although we purposefully choose not to offer turn-key sales solutions, we still incorporate several sales tactics in the other services we provide.

# Can we brag a little?

Our owner has been in business for over five years, and in that time our clients have been so happy with their customized service packages, and our incredibly responsive revenue managers, that **not only do they continue service with us, but they passionately recommend us to other owners**. So, even though we may service more hotels than just yours, you won’t be able to tell!

**Our customized plans are effective and our service is unmatched in the industry. That’s what sets us apart from the crowd and we back it up everyday.**

# What People Are Saying

“I’ve had fantastic experience with Summit Revenue Management! Their service is exceptional, and they are clearly focused on maximizing revenue for their clients. The strategies they implement are top-notch, ensuring we are consistently reaching our revenue goals. I really appreciate their prompt responses to RFPs, Meeting Broker, Hotel Planner, and their commitment to keeping our rates competitive within the comp set.

They also go the extra mile by conducting local research, which has been incredibly helpful in building LNR accounts. The personalized service they provide caters to all our needs! I highly recommend them to anyone looking to boost their revenue!”

#### — Troy Orgeron (GM, IHG)

“We have been working with Summit Revenue Management for over 5 years. They support several of our hotels with both revenue management and remote sales support. Their data-driven approach and personalized strategies based on our different markets and hotel Brands set them apart. We appreciate their customized services to meet our needs. Staff response time and support is top notch. Highly recommend.”

#### \- Viral Patel (Owner, multiple brands)

“Our hotel had an extremely difficult stretch in 2022 to mid 2023.  Occupancy, review scores, and overall revenue was precipitously dropping and internally we were struggling to find answers as to why.  A colleague recommended that we should consider Darcie Bobrowski and Summit Revenue Management.

Darcie has decades of experience in the hospitality industry with the added benefit of familiarity with our local area.  From the beginning, we were skeptical because a Revenue Manager was yet another expense on an already tight budget.  To minimize risk, we opted for a 6 month trial run and hired Darcie Bobrowski and her team in August of 2023. Darcie quickly created a customized plan for us to get back on track.  She demonstrated a high level of expertise coupled with an easygoing nature that put us fully at ease.

Under Darcie's guidance, our hotel started trending in the right direction.  We made great strides in 2024 and we are off to a very strong start in 2025.  Darcie has far exceeded our expectations and we highly recommend her.”
