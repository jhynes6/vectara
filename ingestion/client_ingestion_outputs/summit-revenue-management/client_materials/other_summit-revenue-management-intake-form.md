 Are there industries you won’t sell to? 
 We only provide services to hotels.  We do not want to sell to luxury hotels, resorts, etc.
 I would like to focus on certain hotel Brands and avoid others.  I would like to avoid selling to IHG hotels.  I would like to focus on Wyndham - LaQuinta mainly, Choice (Not Comfort or Country Inns) - WoodSprings, Quality Inns, Sleep Inns, Best Western - Best Western Core, Best Western Plus,  and Independent hotels (non luxury)

Offerings

What services do you sell to your top 3 target personas? (ex. PPC, Social Content, Email Marketing) 
 Revenue management services 
 Operational services / guidance
 Some sales activities such as providing sales leads for hotel to act on, completing RFPs through CVent, Hotel Planner, meeting broker,etc
 GM / staff mentorship programs where we train the people at the hotel to replace us - saving the hotel money in the long run (for properties not required to have revenue management by their Brand)
 For each service, what are your top offers (packages/examples) that you would be willing to pitch them?
 We like to get access to hotel systems 15 - 30 days prior to contract start date to complete an “audit” of the hotel system set up, current strategies, etc.  We will also do a welcome call with the decision makers to gain knowledge of current pricing strategies, hotel insight, market insight, etc.  This allows us to be informed as we start services and “hit the ground running” once the contract / payment for services begins. 

Cost of Services

What is your average order value? What are your “Starting At” costs for your services?
 Our packages start around $1000 / month per hotel.  Our services and packages are customizable and most hotels build their own package based on their exact needs and market. 

Service Differentiation

What makes you different from your competitors? What is your “special sauce”?
 We treat each client like they are our only hotel we service.  All our revenue managers have worked on property as well as have years of successful revenue management expertise, knowledge and certifications.  We understand the daily challenges hotels face and we ease the workload of the onsite staff by being a dedicated member of the hotel team. 

Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? What do you do to improve their business?
 Hotels are required to have revenue management but they do not feel supported by their current service or that it is cookie cutter service.
 Hotel is not realizing their revenue goals are seeing a decline in market share / revenue
 We can customize a plan to make sure their service focuses on their unique hotel / market.
 One of our company’s goals is to provide a personalized service where the hotel feels like they are our only client. 
 All our revenue managers have worked on property so they understand the struggles of being in hotel operations. 
 Our services deliver more at an affordable price.
 All our revenue managers hold Brand and industry certifications and participate in weekly training to maintain current on industry trends and strategies. 

Case Studies and Previous Customer Successes

For each service, what are case studies or recent customer successes that you use to highlight your expertise in your field?
 We get referrals from current owners / hotels we work with.  
 We see consistent YOY RevPar growth with the hotels we work with.
