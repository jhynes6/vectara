 Are there industries you won’t sell to? 
 (ex. Health Care, Law Firms, Franchises)
 Public clients in Canada and the European Union, due to regulations that a server must exist there.
 Health care sector which would require HIPPA compliance or medical records or data to be stored.

Offerings

What services do you sell to your top 3 target personas? (ex. PPC, Social Content, Email Marketing) 
 (ex: Email marketing to small business owners in the service industry)

Cost of Services

What is your average order value? What are your “Starting At” costs for your services?
 (ex: Email Marketing: campaign strategy, design, development, automation, personalization, and analytics. Pricing is everything from one-off projects at $10-$50k to yearly agreements up to $1MM/year)
 (ex: 1000 Tik Tok Impressions/month + Content Creation= $5000 order value)
 (ex: tier 1: $2500 CPC Budget + $500 Service Fee, tier 3: $12,500 CPC Budget + $2500 Service Fee)
 There are two ZoomGrants products, based on the type of program needed:
 ZoomGrants Pro version includes access to post-award features. 
 ZoomGrants Standard provides a more basic application and provides review/scoring, though no access to post-award features. 
 There are three separate fees in both the ZoomGrants ‘Pro’ and ‘Standard’ products:
 1) Annual Subscription - ZoomGrants operates on an annual subscription basis; Previous year's programs and data can still be accessed in the ZoomGrants platform so long as the account subscription is paid, regardless of whether new Program modules (see below) are created to receive new applications each year. This affords a total of 10GB of data storage that may be held at any time prior to its export by the client. 
 The account subscription is currently $5,000 annually for Pro and $2,000 annually for Standard programs, and pays for access to the ZoomGrants platform and any data in previous years' RFPs/programs within the platform, training and technical assistance for all users, and other maintenance costs. 
 2) Program module fee - Cost is further determined by the number of Program Modules (also sometimes  called RFPs, NOFOs or NOFAs) are needed each year. The program module fee is due when new RFPs/Programs are created to receive new applications. A program can accept new applications for up to one year, or up to 500 applications, whichever comes first (at least for base pricing). After that, program data can be accessed in ZoomGrants indefinitely for those previous years’ programs (as long as the annual account subscription is paid).
 The separate program fee is $3,500 per RFP/program for Pro and $1,500 per Standard program.
 3) Account Activation Fee - One-time cost to implement the account and initial onboarding and training. $1,000 applied first year only at account setup.

Service Differentiation

What makes you different from your competitors? What is your “special sauce”?
 (ex: We implement 8 proprietary flows to maximally engage customers via email. 14 touch-points across a 30 day visit to our customers site has been proven to concert the highest % of site visits to paying and repeat customers)
 ZoomGrants is a cloud-based (Internet) solution with no hardware to purchase, install or download, allowing an account to be created and online applications to be launched quickly. 
 ZoomGrants is intuitive to operate and provides the ability to gather and export data into multiple report formats for comparison and analysis.
 ZoomGrants is one of the only vendors that is 100% owned, operated and supported in the United States. This is an important consideration when taking into account how and where your data will be stored and accessed.
 ZoomGrants staff are knowledgeable of the grant industry with staff who have previous grant management experience.
 ZoomGrants supports multiple grant types across an organization, presenting a less siloed approach to grant management software. Each Program can be customized by the administrator for each program’s  workflow process.
 ZoomGrants provides an all-inclusive solution for grant makers which includes powerful features to assist in the management of the full grant life cycle. 

Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? What do you do to improve their business?
 (ex: My clothing line has stopped reaching new buyers and we want to break into a new niche. Facebook keeps getting more expensive and makes it hard to target new buyers.
 Solution: Organic UGC content is the perfect mechanism to branch out to new customers. We help you find influencers who are exactly like your target audience, work with them to create videos and then use those videos to penetrate your new niche audience.)
 Paper application processes not only waste paper - they are time consuming for staff.
 Solution: Your staff is probably over-qualified for making copies, preparing binders, collating, filing, correcting applications/binders, creating reports, researching, communicating, distribution, reviewing, creating spreadsheets, data input, meeting management, decision management, etc. Using ZoomGrants™ will quickly clear up their time to focus on much higher priorities. ZoomGrants’ Pricing Calculator shows that based on a ZoomGrants Per Year cost of $8,500.00, this equates to estimated Labor Savings of $20,000 Per Year
 Data is stored in multiple locations (email, spreadsheets, hard files, electronic files, etc.)
 Solution: Common storage for all data for the admin team to have access to 24/7.
 Incomplete applications are submitted resulting in disqualification or administrator time to follow-up to collect missing information.
 Solution: Before an applicant submits an application ZoomGrants will check to make sure that they have answered the displayed questions and have uploaded something in each “required” document slot.
 Emails and Mail are mis-directed or documents are filed in the wrong folder - no more losing the information (applicants mistype email address or sending to wrong mailing address)
 Solution: Applications, reports and invoices are all submitted within ZoomGrants.  Each application created is provided with an auto-generated identification number. This number links all the information together through the application’s entire lifecycle. 
 The agency runs multiple programs and they all look different and creates confusion for applicants. Additionally, the agency has to manually aggregate the data from the multiple programs to analyze the impact across all programs.
 Solution: ZoomGrants creates consistencies in the application, monitoring/oversight and data collection processes across agencies or within a jurisdiction, region, or state. ZoomGrants supports multiple grant types across an organization supporting a less siloed approach to grant management software and data analysis.
 Applications are difficult to read/review with the variety of formatting and images used. Unintended bias may occur toward applicants that are able to use/hire professional grant-writers.
 Solution: ZoomGrants text boxes will save unformatted text only (no formatted lists, bolds, italics, underlines, unique fonts or fort sizes, etc.). Simple Text formatting saves time and helps streamline the application review and monitoring efforts.
 The reviewing process can be time consuming and difficult to manage.  Preparing Reviewer packets takes time and multiple copies of each application (with all attachments) have to be provided. There is no mechanism to monitor progress of the reviewers to make sure they complete on time. Handwritten comments from reviewers can be difficult to read.
 Solution: Reviewers read, score and comment on applications within ZoomGrants based on criteria put forth by the administrator.  Administrators can monitor reviewers’ progress using the Scoring Report or the individual Progress Chart on each application.

Case Studies and Previous Customer Successes

For each service, what are case studies or recent customer successes that you use to highlight your expertise in your field?
 (ex: generated 50k in net new sales in 30 days for a service business with a seasonal email marketing campaign)
 (ex: generated 120k in net new revenue with a GenZ-focused organic TikTok Campaign) 
 (ex: increased CTR by 240% and sign ups by 318% with Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo Campaign)
 Since 2002, ZoomGrants has been assisting state and local government, private foundations and other non-profit organizations across the country with transferring their paper-based application and grant management processes into our efficient online system.
