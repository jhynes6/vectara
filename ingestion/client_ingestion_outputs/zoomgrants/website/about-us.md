### 21

Years Of Experience

## Our History

ZoomGrants™ is a corporation founded in 2002 and headquartered in colorful Colorado.

The company was created to solve a problem of a lack of good online solutions for grant management – at the time, most philanthropy was still being done on paper.

This was costly, not only in financial terms, but also in terms of environmental impact and organizational inefficiency.

Seeing an opportunity to have a dramatic impact on the foundation community as a whole, the company aimed to ‘build a better mousetrap’ that would serve the foundation community by allowing them to focus on their original objectives rather than the mundane tasks of program administration.

## Trusted Advisors

Since ZoomGrants™ inception, we’ve become a trusted advisor of communities and organizations across the country, helping streamline their processes and get them back to what really matters – making a difference in their communities.

Here at ZoomGrants™, we strive to under-promise and over-deliver to all of our clients, and our team remains fiercely dedicated to the triple bottom line of people, planet and prosperity.

## Corporate Social Responsibility

ZoomGrants™ was established in 2002 with an eye on executing on the fundamentals of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and the triple bottom line of People, Planet, and Prosperity. A sustainable mission in concentrating on CSR principles has been an ideal blueprint for ZoomGrants™ to serve the grant and scholarship industries. A mission to help make application management professionals’ jobs easier, better organized, and cost-effective has been a clear vision for over two decades. ZoomGrants™ plans moving forward is to remain CSR centric and stay consistent to the values of great technology, extraordinary customer service, and being viewed as trusted advisors for our customers.

With using ZoomGrants to take your application process online you will save a tremendous amount of paper, water, and other financial costs (see environmental **[calculator](https://is3.website/projects/zoomgrants/pricing/)**)

This forward thinking process serves people by making the administration tasks easier, serves people and prosperity by awarding grants and scholarships quicker, and serves the planet by cutting down on paper use and water usage.

ZoomGrants is proud that CSR principles have been a foundational character of our company since 2002 and has remained part of our company’s culture for over 20 years.
