## Security/Availability

There are several security measures in place that ensure the protection and availability of your data, ranging from the user level to the server level, and even the physical location of the servers.

First, all users are required to login with their own userid and password, giving them access only to the information that they are authorized to access. Once logged in, they are automatically logged out after a period of inactivity.

Next, all pages and data transfers are encrypted using our Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate. While this will encrypt data transfers for you and your users, it would require that the pages on your website also be encrypted if you choose to embed your application on your site.
