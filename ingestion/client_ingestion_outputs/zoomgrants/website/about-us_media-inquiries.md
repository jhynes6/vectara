# Media Inquiries

### ZoomGrants is driven to be an industry resource and “trusted advisor” for grant professionals.

ZoomGrants is driven to be an industry resource and “trusted advisor” for grant professionals. ZoomGrants was founded on the mission to follow the principles of corporate social responsibility (CSR). ZMedia, the media arm of ZoomGrants has published for 13 years the CSR News & Report covering topical stories that affect people, planet and prosperity. The CSR News & Report is distributed to over 3000 grant and scholarship professionals.

If you have stories about grants and scholarships programs that have CSR related content, please feel free to send all stories to [media@zoomgrants.com](mailto:media@zoomgrants.com) and we’ll review for publication consideration. Additionally, the CSR News & Report highlights industry training, conferences, webinars and workshops that enhance the professional enrichment of grant professionals. We encourage you to send ZoomGrants information about those activities to [media@zoomgrants.com](mailto:media@zoomgrants.com) and we’ll do our best to highlight your event.
