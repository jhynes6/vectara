# Which is the Best Grant Management Software?

Grants are the money that government departments, public and private trusts, and foundations give. The money sponsors projects and funds ideas to provide public services and stimulate the economy. For the process to run smoothly, grant management software is needed. The software helps NGOs administer, organize, prioritize and process grant applications they receive from charities. So what features should the best software possess?

## How much does a grant management software cost?

It’s hard to figure out how much it costs. Most software vendors don’t list their pricing on their websites. However, the price varies depending on the specification and capabilities of the software. In addition, your payment plan differs depending on whether the system is sold with perpetual or subscription licensing. Paying by perpetual means, you pay the whole amount upfront before using the software.

On the other hand, subscription licensing is paying a fee every month or annually. The two payment methods are equal, but knowing your budget is vital to see which suits you. Also, remember to include additional fees like training, implementation, and support.
