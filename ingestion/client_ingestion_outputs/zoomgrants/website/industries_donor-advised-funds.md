# Effective, Intuitive Donor Grant Management Software

Donor grants or donor-advised funds are used to contribute to charitable organizations and nonprofits. These grants are funded by specific organizations, individuals, or sometimes by government agencies for a very specific reason. Some of the purposes for donor grants include community development, educational programs, or to complete specific research types that are not otherwise funded through public or private means.

Due to the contributions by specific donors for these grants, it is critical to have effective and comprehensive donor grant management software. [ZoomGrants](https://www.zoomgrants.com/) has developed a grant management software program that provides the level of transparency, reporting, and analytics to ensure all involved in these grants have access to the information they require throughout the life cycle of the grant.
