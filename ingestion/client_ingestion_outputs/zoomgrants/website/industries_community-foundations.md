# Intuitive Grant Management Software For Community Foundations

Managing grants for community foundations can be a time-consuming and difficult task. Trying to use existing software solutions to manage a grant can create problems with collecting and managing data, reporting, and ensuring the grant is administered correctly throughout its life cycle.

[ZoomGrants](https://www.zoomgrants.com/) offers an affordable option in grant management software for community foundations. This software is fully scalable and can be used for small grants or for large grants that may require ongoing management for sustained periods of time.

## Support for Community Foundations

Our community foundation software is intuitive and easy to use, even if this is your first attempt at grant administration. Our online tutorials and videos, combined with our highly-rated customer and technical support, make it easy to have your grant program up and running in just a few hours.  
The grant management software comes with a complete suite of tools that provide end-to-end grant management solutions. Each of the tools, from designing the grant application to completing reports and data analysis, are fully customizable to meet the specific grant and community foundation needs.

With many community grants, transparency and reporting of publicly viewable data is a critical factor. We make it easy to create and publish this data, saving the time and frustration of using a different software program for each aspect of the grant management requirements. Our grant and scholarship management software simplifies the work of the grant administrator and the committee.
