# Essential Grant Management Solutions For Transportation Projects

There are many different aspects to transportation grants. These can range from infrastructure for public transportation to new vehicles and equipment or specific services for underserved communities. Public transportation grants can also be used to promote innovations to reduce traffic by promoting other types of shared transportation and services.

Having a customized and streamlined grant management software for transportation projects makes end-to-end oversight of the grant simple, easy, and effective. ZoomGrants provides a software solution that is tailored to your specific project, application criteria, review process, and the awarding and management of the grant.
