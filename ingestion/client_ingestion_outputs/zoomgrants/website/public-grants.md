# Simplify The Management Of Grants By Public Agencies

To be considered a public grant, the grant must be funded by tax dollars. There are many different agencies in the government that have grant opportunities, with each agency having a different focus and grant criteria.

Most public grants are designed to provide services, education, or support for specific issues relevant to some of the population. This could include grants for educational projects, small business ownership, or even for affordable housing. These public grants for nonprofits may be offered at the local, state, or federal level.
