# The Ideal Grant Management Software For Entitled Jurisdictions

Grants are often created to address deficits in services and opportunities in specific areas or jurisdictions. These jurisdictions can be a small town, city, rural area, county, or any combination of these locations that do not currently have adequate services in one or more areas.

Entitlement programs also fall under these types of grants, providing support in some way for people identified by one or more factors. Businesses, which may be for-profit or non-profit, can apply for entitlement program grants to provide the required services or support.
