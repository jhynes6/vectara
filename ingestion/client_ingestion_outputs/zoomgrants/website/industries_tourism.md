# Simplifying Your Tourism Grant Program

Tourism grants are an effective way to create projects and enhance tourism to generate revenue for small and large cities, towns, and geographic areas in any country around the world.

These travel and tourism grant programs are extremely popular and attract a large number of applicants, which can make the grant evaluation and management process extremely time consuming and difficult. However, with customized software by [ZoomGrants](https://www.zoomgrants.com/), your tourism grant program can be streamlined, simplified, and automated, saving you time and money.
