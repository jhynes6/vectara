# Supporting Distribution Of The American Rescue Plan Funding

COVID-19 caused significant financial damage across the country. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, also known as ARPA, is designed to provide $350 billion in funding at state and local levels.

Cities and counties are invited to apply for American Rescue Plan funding. Cities will have access to $65 billion, divided between Community Block Development Grant jurisdictions and others. Counties will also divide $65 billion based on the specific population and if the county is a CBDG recipient.

## Using Funds From the Federal American Rescue Plan

The American Rescue Plan Grant funds can supplement lost revenue during the COVID-19 health emergency based on the funds collected the year before COVID-19.

The funds can also be used to assist small businesses, industries, or households struggling to recover economically. Infrastructure for water, sewer, and broadband, as well as essential worker premium pay, can also be addressed through the fund.

Needless to say, the application and management of this program are complicated and complex unless you have the right system in place.
