##### Information Collection and Use

In general, when you visit zoomgrants.com and access information you remain anonymous. We do not require you to register or provide personal information to us to view our site.

There are occasions when we will ask for additional information in order to provide you with services that may be valuable to you. For example, personally identifiable information will be collected in order for you to become a client of ZoomGrants. This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest and to connect users that have requested contact with other users by the nature of the use of this site.

In consideration of your use of the Service, you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself and/or your company as prompted by the Service’s registration form (such information being the “Registration Data”) and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or ZoomGrants has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, ZoomGrants has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service (or any portion thereof).

Use of the ZoomGrants service does not constitute any kind of transfer of ownership of data entered into or created within the system.

ZoomGrants will make your information, including personally identifiable information, available to other appropriate ZoomGrants users that you have voluntarily entered your information to be provided to, implying your consent to share the information. Additionally, ZoomGrants will make your information available when we respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process; or we believe that your actions violate applicable laws, ZoomGrants Terms of Use or any usage guidelines for specific products or services, or threaten the rights, property, or safety of ZoomGrants, our users, or others.

Customers with appropriate access to information who are required by law to make that information available will be responsible for all necessary redactions of that information.

With respect to information you submit or make available for inclusion on the site, you grant ZoomGrants the following worldwide, royalty free and non-exclusive license(s), as applicable: the license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publicly perform and publicly display such information on the site solely for the purposes of providing the ZoomGrants Services and promoting the specific and potential ZoomGrants client(s) to which such information was submitted or made available and for uses otherwise inherent in the services being rendered by ZoomGrants. This license exists only for as long as you elect to continue to include such information on the site and will terminate at the time you remove or ZoomGrants removes such information from the site.

We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.

Because of the financial nature of our business, ZoomGrants is not designed to appeal to children under the age of 18. ZoomGrants operates in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and does not permit registration by, and will not knowingly collect or use personally identifiable information from anyone under 18 years of age. This requirement is clearly posted during the registration process.

##### Passwords

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your information and password. You shall be responsible for all uses of your password, regardless of whether these uses are authorized by you. You agree to notify ZoomGrants immediately of any unauthorized use of your registration or password.

##### How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information

If you have created an account, you can access to review all your personally identifiable information that we collect at any time by browsing to https://www.zoomgrants.com/login and logging in with your UserID and Password. You may then change your login information by selecting the Account Profile link. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. If you have forgotten your password, contact Customer Support via email at Questions@zoomgrants.com.

##### General Practices Regarding Use and Storage

You acknowledge that ZoomGrants may establish general practices and limits concerning use of the Service, including without limitation the maximum number of days that Content will be retained by the Service. You agree that ZoomGrants has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any Content maintained or transmitted by the Service beyond these normal practices and limits. You acknowledge that ZoomGrants reserves the right to log off accounts that are inactive for an extended period of time. You further acknowledge that ZoomGrants reserves the right to change these general practices and limits at any time, in its sole discretion, with or without notice.

##### Acceptable Use Guidelines

ZoomGrants encourages users to participate in the Internet experience, to voice their views, and to benefit from interactive experiences. Nonetheless, it is imperative that you are very aware that there are rules and standards that must be adhered to as a ZoomGrants user.

Users are solely responsible for their conduct while using any part of ZoomGrants, including, but not limited to, the content of any interactions you generate, transmit, or maintain via zoomgrants.com. ZoomGrants takes no responsibility for any such online distribution or publication by you or by any other party.

ZoomGrants cannot and will not review every message or other content you or any other party may generate or post, and ZoomGrants is not responsible for the content thereof.

By using any of the services of ZoomGrants, you agree not to do any of the following:

1. Upload to, distribute or otherwise publish through the ZoomGrants site any message, data, information, text or other material (“Content”) that is unlawful, libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, indecent, lewd, harassing, threatening, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, abusive, inflammatory, or otherwise objectionable.
2. Upload or transmit any Content that would constitute or encourage a criminal offense, violate the rights of any party, or would otherwise create liability or violate any local, state, federal or international law.
3. Upload or transmit any Content that may infringe any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or other intellectual or proprietary right of any party. By posting any Content, you represent and warrant that you have the lawful right to distribute and reproduce such Content.
4. Impersonate any person or entity or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity.

ZoomGrants does not pre-screen Content and therefore takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any information posted or uploaded by you or any third party that you may encounter. ZoomGrants reserves the right, but not the obligation, to remove any materials it deems objectionable. You agree to hold harmless ZoomGrants and its affiliates and parties with whom ZoomGrants has contracted for purposes of communications made, or materials posted by others, or the use of third parties of this Site.

Under no circumstances will ZoomGrants be liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any Content, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via the Service.

As a ZoomGrants user, should you or anyone using your privileges, violate the terms of this agreement (as determined at the sole discretion of ZoomGrants), ZoomGrants reserves the right to delete, move, or edit any such items, and ZoomGrants may take other actions against you ranging from the issuing of a warning about a violation to the termination of user privileges without advance notice. Whether or not to take such actions at any time shall be at the sole discretion of ZoomGrants.

##### Data Security

This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. While we use UserID’s and Passwords to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices or the offices of our contractors who are similarly bound to protect your information. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.

##### Security of Credit Card Information

Payment arrangements will be made through QuickBooks and all credit card information will be collected and used by QuickBooks and not ZoomGrants. At no time will ZoomGrants view or collect credit card information. Information you submit to the site will not be available for the services being rendered until payment has been received and processed. Payment may also be made by sending a check, payable to ZoomGrants, to:

Billing Department  
ZoomGrants  
44 Cook St.  
Suite 100  
Denver, CO 80206

##### Modifications to Service

ZoomGrants reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice. You agree that ZoomGrants shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Service.

##### Web Site Security Rules

Users are prohibited from violating or attempting to violate the security of ZoomGrants, including, without limitation, (a) accessing data not intended for such User or logging into a server or account which the User is not authorized to access; (b) attempting to probe, scan or test the vulnerability of a system or network or to breach security or authentication measures without proper authorization; (c) attempting to interfere with service to any user, host, or network, including, without limitation, via means of submitting a virus to the ZoomGrants site or network, overloading, “flooding,” “spamming,” “mail bombing,” or “crashing;” or (d) sending unsolicited email, including promotions and/or advertising of products or services. Violations of system or network security may result in civil or criminal liability. ZoomGrants will immediately terminate, without warning, any account which it believes, in its sole discretion has breached this section.

ZoomGrants will investigate occurrences that may involve such violations and may involve, and cooperate with, law enforcement authorities in prosecuting users who are involved in such violations. ZoomGrants reserves the right to cooperate with any and all law enforcement agencies, including complying with warrants, court orders and subpoenas. ZoomGrants is entitled to disclose to law enforcement agencies any information about you, the User, and anything you do with respect to the ZoomGrants site and its tools. By your use of the ZoomGrants site and its tools, you authorize ZoomGrants to take such action.

##### Termination

Notwithstanding any of these terms and conditions, ZoomGrants reserves the right, without notice and in its sole discretion, to terminate a User’s ability to access and use the ZoomGrants site.
