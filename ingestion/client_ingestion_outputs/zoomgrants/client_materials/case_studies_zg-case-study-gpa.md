**Grant Professionals Association
Case Study on Streamlining Annual Conference Administration**

**OVERVIEW**
The Grant Professionals Association (GPA) is an international membership association for everyone in the grants industry. GPA helps grant professionals seek to continually improve their professional knowledge and skills in grant research, proposal development, and post-award grant management. They set the standard with their commitment to ethical practices, their high-quality educational offerings, excellence in resources, and their community of professionals committed to serving the public good.

The GPA has an annual conference (the GPA GrantSummit) that attracts over 1,200 grant professionals for a three-day conference full of learning and networking opportunities. Grant professionals come together to exchange strategies, solutions, resources, and more. With three days of inspiration, education, and networking, attendees are equipped with a year’s worth of support for their daily responsibilities as grant professionals.

**ADMINISTRATIVE CHALLENGE #1**

Every year the GPA receives 100's of applications for speakers to present various topics at the GrantSummit. The process of collecting all of those applications and reviewing the 100's of requests for session speakers is a daunting task.

Keeping track of all the applications through spreadsheets and mountains of paperwork bogged down the review process. Then once the exhaustive review stage was complete documenting and executing the communication to the speakers being awarded was another administrative challenge.

**ADMINISTRATIVE CHALLENGE #2**

Additionally, The GPA awards scholarships through the Grant Professionals Foundation (GPF). The GPF was established in January 2006 to ensure resources are available to educate, credential and assist grant professionals who secure the funding necessary for not-for-profits to serve the greater good. These scholarships are intended to help grant professionals enhance their respective careers within the grant industry.

**THE SOLUTION FOR NOT JUST ONE CHALLENGE BUT TWO**

The GPA chose ZoomGrants to help with the management of 100's of session speakers as well as collecting all of the applications for the GPI scholarships.

*"ZoomGrants has really made the process for both our call for speakers and on scholarship applications much more streamlined. It also made it easier for our reviewers to do their job and the applicants enjoyed how easy it is to is. We couldn't be happier in how much ZoomGrants has made our conference simpler to manage."*
