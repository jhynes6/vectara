Campaign Criteria

Targeting

Describe your top three target personas (clients): 
 We sell to small business owners and start-ups with more than 2 full-time employees) 
 Other than business owners, we also sell into CEOs, Presidents, Partners, Managing Partners, HR Directors and Sales and Marketing VPs
 Are there industries you won’t sell to? 
 (ex. Health Care, Law Firms, Franchises)
 Companies over 100 employees
 Stay away from middle management. Only the titles listed above.

Offerings

What services do you sell to your top 3 target personas? (ex. PPC, Social Content, Email Marketing) 
 We sell business training services to leadership teams. Delivery is via Zoom. If custom training is selected, the trainings can also be on-site/in-person. Most of the standard SCALE UP training is via zoom-based workshops. The SCALE UP workshop training is 40 hours in total, and consists of 4-modules. Please see www.skayle360.com for more. 
 For each service, what are your top offers (packages/examples) that you would be willing to pitch them?
 There’s 100% reimbursement for business in MA with fewer than 100 employees, so I believe that’s enticing enough.

Case Studies and Previous Customer Successes

For each service, what are case studies or recent customer successes that you use to highlight your expertise in your field?
 Skayle 360 is a startup. In my past life, I led a 70+ person full-service marketing firm in Boston that worked with hundreds of companies to solve their most challenging growth issues. I also am the SBA Small Business Person of the Year, which should add credibility to the SCALE UP offering given I’ll be the Lead Trainer of the training. You can check out www.chrisciunci.com for more information when needed.

Service Differentiation

What makes you different from your competitors? What is your “special sauce”?
 (The SCALE UP training is based on Chris Ciunc’s 15+ years of working in the trenches with hundreds of companies solving their most pressing growth challenges. Participants will be getting a level of expertise and experience that no other training in MA related to growth has. 

Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? What do you do to improve their business?
 I am a startup and don’t know the best way to grow into a more mature company with the right lead generation and process in place.
 I am a small business that has hit a growth plateau and don’;t know what else to try to grow. I’ve tried marketing, hired sales people and still am not seeing the growth I’m expecting.
 I am a small business and am wearing many hats. It’s difficult for me and my small team to stay on the cutting edge of what’s out there to grow.
