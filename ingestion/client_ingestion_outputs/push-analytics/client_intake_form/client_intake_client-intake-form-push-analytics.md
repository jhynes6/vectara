Tell us more about your Company 

Briefly describe the Company.
 What do you offer? What are your products and/or services? (Also include the price points of the service/products)

eCommerce full growth marketing services: this includes Google Ads, Facebook Ads, Instagram Ads, TikTok Ads (Sometimes) and access to our full 360 degree analytics. Starting at $5k per month retainer and goes up from there - depends heavily on the client and the amount of ad spend, industry standard is around 10-15% of ad spend but we don’t charge % of ad spend because we believe it’s a conflict  of interest (this is actually a big value prop by the way for the customers) so we have to price it out accordingly instead. You can use that benchmark to estimate depending on the size of the customer. 
 We can also do analytics only for people where they can just get access to our dashboards only but we prefer to just sell the full eCommerce package. 
 On the Hubspot side we can do literally anything to do with Hubspot we work end to end including: 
 Process Buildout: We can do processes for the entire business including sales, onboarding and service. This is a huge value prop because a lot of people don’t know how to process and don’t pitch this angle. We should not sleep on this one :)
 Web Development: We can buildout anything in Hubspot, Website, etc. Our team is able to build it out as Hubspot module which always re-usability very easily
 Marketing Retainer: We’re able to run their marketing efforts on Hubspot (Sequences, Marketing Emails, Blog cadence) on a retainer basis
 Hubspot Onboarding: We do full Hubspot onboarding on all hubs 
 Custom Object Development: Our team is experts on Hubspot Custom Objects and we’re able to do some really cool things with custom objects and push Hubspot well beyond its limits. We actually even built our own tool internally that manages custom objects (which we were thinking of deploying but that’s a different proposition lol) → if you are curious checkout  this landing page (not public, please do not send in the emails) → Again this is a HUGE value prop. A lot of agencies don’t even know how to use custom objects we’re already done things like completely track properties, AIRCRAFT even and more. 
 You can also see our services page here.

Who do you sell to? Who is your target customer? (ex. Location (what country/countries will you work with), demographics, interests, goals... the more information the better) Can you market products for 21+? (alcohol, CBD, Cannabis, etc.)

eCommerce businesses $4M/year+ USA based but we can do Canada/UK/Australia though we shouldn’t go out of our way to target them. We technically can work with other countries too but it’s a matter of affordability.
 We are not interested in marketing products that are for 21+, please exclude all Cannabis, Adult Products, Alcohol, Lewdity, Gambling, Tobacco, etc. 

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words?

eCommece would describe as (various ones of the below):
 They feel like they are spending too much on ads (relative to their returns – inefficient spend basically)
 They aren’t growing fast enough on their business
 They’ve reached a ceiling on growth 
 Their ROAS/MER is bad
 They have no idea what their current agency is doing because there is no visibility 
 Hubspot 
 They have Hubspot but it’s underutilized and they aren’t using it properly
 Don’t know how to use the full features of Hubspot 
 They want to shift from another CRM to Hubspot (or are having issues with their CRM and we propose Hubspot)
 They want to get Hubspot and need help onboarding
 They need help running marketing campaigns in their Hubspot portal 
 They want to buildout their automation in Hubspot
 They want to do something with custom objects in Hubspot

What CRM do you currently use?

Hubspot

What is your main goal of working with us? (Expand to a new sales vertical, scale existing product revenue, others)

Scale existing revenue and build a steady stream of leads that we can fill our calendars with. We have a very good close rate when we get in front of the right customers that are qualified so we should have no issue if Mintleads can just drive us leads. 

If MintLeads and you are opening a bottle of champagne a year from now, what would we be celebrating?

If we are celebrating then we would be celebrating that we got an additional 100-150k/mo+ in revenue off mintleads efforts and we have a consistent steady stream of leads in a  funnel– I think this is actually very doable and not even a stretch goal
