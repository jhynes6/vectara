# Website

A website needs to be more than just a pretty face!

With the increasing trend of consumers researching a business or products/services online before buying. It is now, more so than ever, your business needs a website to speak to these consumers. Your website has only a few seconds from when a consumer jumps on it to convert a browser into a lead. Various factors like keywords, page loading speed, aesthetics, and user experience will convert your lead into a sale or potentially leave money on the table.

If you already have a website, your website will also need to be maintained on a regular basis to provide the best user experience and rank well on search engines. It's also common for a business to find that they have outgrown their current website as they expand. So, if any of these two scenarios sound familiar and your business is having website issues, give Iceberg Digital a call and see how our team can help you.
