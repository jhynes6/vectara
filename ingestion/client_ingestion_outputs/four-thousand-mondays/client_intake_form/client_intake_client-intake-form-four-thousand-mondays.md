Hi there ____,


I hope you are having a fabulous week so far!


I'm hoping you can connect me with the best person on your team who selects speakers for your annual event. I see you have your big XYZ 2025 Conference coming up in September, and as a professional speaker who works in the healthcare space quite regularly, I'd love to be a part of your event! (Also: Charlotte is pretty fabulous, so there's that too .)


Thank you for reaching back out to me directly, or letting me know if there is a team member I should be connected to.


Cheers to a wonderful week ahead,
