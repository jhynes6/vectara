## How Much Longer Are You Going to Wait?

Last week I wrote a post called [**Are You a Dream Weaver or a Dream Leaver**](https://fourthousandmondays.com/are-you-a-dream-weaver-or-a-dream-leaver) and I stirred some dream dust up out there. I love to rankle, because it’s the poke in the ribs that gets us moving towards our sizzley-but-scary goals… not so much the warm hug from a well-meant friend who says, “it’s okay to shelve your dreams, Sweetie! I know it’s hard. Let’s refill our mimosas.” There will be no shelving of dreams on my watch! (But I will have another mimosa with you.) **We will take purposeful, courageous action towards our dreams—that’s what we’re going to do.** And you know how we do that?

I’m going to ask this question with 88% care + concern and 12% sass + snark:

**WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU WAITING FOR?**  
(The sass + snark seemed like more than 12% there and I’m only a little bit sorry about that.)

Said differently, **HOW MUCH LONGER ARE YOU GOING TO WAIT TO START LIVING LIKE YOU MEAN IT?**

*   Another year?  
*   After two more emails that need answering?  
*   After the last kid goes off to college?  
*   After you retire?  
*   After you feel good about the way you look in your favorite suit again?  
*   After you begin to feel confident?  
*   After you get that latest certification in a long line up of educational pursuits that are really just delaying your dreams?  
*   After you find love?  
*   After you get settled in your new place?  
*   After you get your laptop and tech stuff worked out, once and for all? (Hahaha, keep waiting for that day, I dare you.)  
*   After you find your god?  
*   After you network just a bit more in your industry?  
*   After you kick that persnickety-persistent Adderall habit?  
*   After you’ve delivered 10 more keynotes?  
*   After things slow down a bit at work?  
*   After you exhaustively research all the types of LLC’s and get your business set up “the right way”?  
*   After you pay down your debt?  
*   After you organize the drawers and cupboards in your office?  
*   After you get a ring light?  
*   After the current administration changes?  
*   After you befriend Reece Whitherspoon (who will then select your book for her book club)?  
*   After you get that prostate thing looked at?  
*   After you pay down more of the mortgage? (OMG this is the exact story of the Uber driver, Merriman, who just took me to the airport; when he was first married he and his wife skipped vacations for five years so they could make extra house payments, just to be responsible. And then she got a brain tumor and died. In her early 20s. This man, this dear sweet man, from the perspective of being 77 years old, told me he deeply regretted “she never got a vacation.” I can’t even handle this story.)  
*   After things “die down” out there?

**The only thing that might “die down” is you, Little Miss/ Mr. Perishable. Or even worse: you might keep living, and your dreams become the casualties of your Chickenheartedness.**

That sounded judgey and it is here that I must share I am a part-time resident of Camp Chickenhearted. I am so scared of my goals and dreams and plans and it’s only because I slap myself in the face with a healthy dose of mortality reality that I take any action at all. I am simply overriding my innate tendency to play it safe/ shelve my dreams/ snuggle deeper under the comfy fleece blanket on the couch…  I am consciously overriding my chickenhearted nature with this memento mori ethos (remembering I will die).

And it works.

**What dreams are you postponing? And how much longer are you going to wait to go after them?**

It’s not going to get easier by waiting. It will likely only get harder (because you will maybe get more rigid in your ways/ feel more submissive to fear/ get glaucoma/ die).

**Today is all you have. Odds are you have tomorrow too, but why not make today a day that counts?**

Thanks to my Aunt Mary for sending me this most excellent meme:

Go after it, my friend. Go be decidedly alive out there. You have nothing to lose… except of course your life.

**P.S.:** If you haven’t read my book, [**You Only Die Once: How to Make It to the End with No Regrets**](https://fourthousandmondays.com/book/), _what the heck are you waiting for?!_
