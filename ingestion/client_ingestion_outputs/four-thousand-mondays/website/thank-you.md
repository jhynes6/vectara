# You're officially on the list!

After an exhaustive approval process _(not really)_ you’ve been added to the list _(yes really)_, and will start receiving emails every week or so.  
While I can’t prove it, you’ll likely add 3.3 years to your life by reading the articles. _(And not mediocre years– we’re talking about life-enhancing years. So bravo for you.)  
_Keep reading for ways to take this to the next level.

# Ways we can take this to second base:

You can take the **“How Alive (or Dead) are You?” quiz**, and receive customized results along with The Guide to Being Totally Alive.  
High amusement factor + high value factor = time well spent.

You can play with the **“How Many Mondays Do You Have Left?” calculator**, and use it as a motivator to start making the most of however many weeks you have left.  
If it scares you, it might be a sign you need to add some life to your life.

You can read my book (or have me read it to you on the audiobook format, just like we’re sitting together and sharing a bottle of Champagne). It’s a lot of fun and some pretty cool people have endorsed it, so, there’s that.
