# How many Mondays do you have left?

Does that question send you into a panic spiral, or are you convinced that, unlike everyone in the history of life on earth, you will somehow avoid the tragic end and live to tell the tale? Statistically, we get about 4,000 Mondays in our lifetime, so if you’re halfway through your life, you might have roughly 2,000 Mondays to go. The good news is that you are in charge of how you spend those days: toiling at a job you hate, or creating a career you love; scrolling mindlessly for hours a day, or pursuing the hobbies and travel that light you up; dreading the end, or living a full life that allows you to greet the Grim Reaper with a smile.

#### WELCOME TO THE 352 PAGES THAT'LL ENLIVEN YOUR LIFE!

## Learn step-by-step how to grow into the version of your life that you’ve secretly been fantasizing about: the one jam-packed with vitality and meaning.

# Built around the principles of positive psychology...

_You Only Die Once_ is the jolt that will bring you back to life, no near-death experience required. Full of practical takeaways and research-backed content, this book will motivate readers to take action on the life they _want_ to be living, acting like a defibrillator for the soul. Accompanied by my oh-so-charming illustrations, this book won’t lecture you about eating more kale or insist that the only path forward is to quit your job and move to Provence (although it’s not _not_ suggesting you do that either. The latter, that is. I’d never ask anyone to eat more kale.). Instead, it’s a real-life guide to small changes that reawaken your passion and curiosity for life. Packed with inspiring stories, exercises, quizzes, quotes, and a step-by-step plan to awaken the liveliest version of you, _You Only Die Once_ is the healthy dose of mortality you need to start living with urgency and meaning.

###### “Jodi Wellman’s book offers a creative and refreshing new look at death and mortality.

Roy F. Baumeister; President, International Positive Psychology Association, and New York Times Bestselling Author
