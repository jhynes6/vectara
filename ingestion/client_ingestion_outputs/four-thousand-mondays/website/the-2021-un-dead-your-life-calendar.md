# The 2021 “Un-Dead Your Life” Calendar

I made this 2021 “Un-Dead Your Life” calendar to help you inject some aliveness into your year.

2020 wasn’t the kindest to even the zestiest of us out there, so some of us might need a little vitality CPR to come back to life, right?

I hope you find even the smallest bit of inspiration to celebrate the absurdity of being alive (like National Pina Colada Day on 7/10… get the blender ready).

Download your free calendar below!

Cheers to living life in 2021 as though you’ve been warned you won’t live forever,
