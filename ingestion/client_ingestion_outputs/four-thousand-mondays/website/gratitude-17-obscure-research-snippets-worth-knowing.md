## Gratitude: 17 Obscure Research Snippets Worth Knowing

Posted by[](https://fourthousandmondays.com/author/jwellman/)

With Thanksgiving on the horizon, I‚Äôm feeling a wee bit petulant about All Things Gratitude. Is it because I‚Äôm a spoiled ingrate? No! _(I mean, mostly no!)_ _(Okay fine, I take mostly everything in my life for granted. But that‚Äôs not why I‚Äôm giving gratitude the side-eye.)_

**I‚Äôm worried that amidst the ubiquity of said topic this time ‚Äòo year, you‚Äôve got a moderate-to-severe case of gratitude fatigue.**

So in an effort to NOT bore you to tears (or death) with all the gratitude research and BuzzFeed listicles you‚Äôve already consumed, I‚Äôm going to razzle-dazzle you with the lesser-known facts and stats and musings about ‚Äúthe reason for the season.‚Äù üëà To be clear: pecan pie really isn‚Äôt supposed to be the reason for the season. You guessed it ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs glitter-covered gratitude!

## **Let‚Äôs open the Cabinet of Gratitude Curiosities**

You already know that gratitude leads to better mental health, well-being, subjective life satisfaction, and shinier hair. Here are 17 facts that might not have come across your radar ‚Ä¶

**![The Gratitude Worm ](https://fourthousandmondays.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-09-at-3.11.45-PM-300x212.png)Gratitude makes us obedient.
**This recent gratitude [study](https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2020-99648-001)¬†found that ‚Äúparticipants who were induced to feel gratitude obeyed to a greater extent a command to grind worms in a grinder than those feeling neutral.‚Äù
_You read that right.
_Researchers discovered that ‚Äúgratitude can make a person more vulnerable to social influence, including obeying commands to perform an ethically questionable act.‚Äù Oooh ‚Ä¶ positive psychology‚Äôs golden child has a dark side!

**![Compendium of Regrets](https://fourthousandmondays.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-09-at-3.20.05-PM-211x300.png)Gratitude reduces regret.
**It‚Äôs no secret that my mission in life (other than making a decent gluten-free pecan pie one day) is to help us lead squander-free, regret-free lives‚Äîso this research tidbit is near and dear to my heart.
One of the best ways to reduce the ‚Äúcoulda shoulda woulda‚Äù pangs of regret is to sprinkle a little gratitude in the mix. [Studies](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-022-00597-0) consistently show that ‚Äúboth dispositional and state gratitude could reduce regret in decision making.‚Äù Engaging in daily ‚Äúhere is what I am grateful for‚Äù reflections not only ameliorates the feeling of regret about your past stupid decisions, but protects you against feelings of regret for your future stupid decisions.

**Gratitude makes us less likely to cheat.
**[Researchers](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797619848351) demonstrate that gratitude reduces the likelihood of study participants to cheat in a laboratory setting and in an anonymous online setting. ‚ÄúWhile only 2% of grateful participants cheated in assigning tasks to themselves, fully 16% of happy or neutral participants cheated.‚Äù _(Said differently, happiness makes us cheat.)_

**![The Now Clock](https://fourthousandmondays.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-09-at-3.16.03-PM.png)Gratitude makes us feel more present in the moment.
**Let me guess: your monkey brain darts between thoughts of the past and future, but rarely spends time in the here and now. You know what helps with that? Sauvignon blanc! ¬†(JK‚Äî you know it‚Äôs gratitude. Doused in a glass of wine.) [Researchers](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-020-00221-z) found that ‚Äúgratitude played a mediating role between the dimensions of time perspective and life satisfaction.‚Äù

**Gratitude can be all about Me, Myself, and I.
**[Researchers](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-021-00475-1) are expanding the concept of gratitude by encouraging us to look in the mirror and practice ‚Äúself-gratitude.‚Äù Actively recognizing our own unique value, and reflecting on questions like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm grateful toward myself for these fantabulous qualities ‚Ä¶‚Äù can not only help us like ourselves better, but broaden the way we think about gratitude. We can appreciate _who we are_ just as much as we can appreciate the good and great things that happen to us.

**![Hands in Prayer](https://fourthousandmondays.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-09-at-3.31.19-PM-293x300.png)Gratitude increases with prayer.
**[Research](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0016731) studies have shown that ‚Äúprayer plays a causal role in promoting gratitude,‚Äù possibly because of the repetitive and ritualistic nature associated with praying ‚Ä¶ which might allow for further reflection and thankfulness.

**Gratitude kicks memory lane‚Äôs ass.
**[Study](https://iaap-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1758-0854.2011.01058.x) participants demonstrated higher levels of life satisfaction and self-esteem after a gratitude contemplation exercise, compared to a ‚Äúdescribe a memorable event‚Äù exercise.

**![Stack 'o Cash](https://fourthousandmondays.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-09-at-3.22.41-PM-300x204.jpg)Gratitude makes us less materialistic.
**The sense of importance we attach to our worldly possessions (the car! The house! The pony! The yellow diamonds! The retirement fund!) tends to [diminish](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760802216311) when we recognize, appreciate, and savor what we already have. (Sounds like a good time to hum Sheryl Crow‚Äôs ‚Äúit‚Äôs¬†not having what you want, it‚Äôs¬†wanting what you‚Äôve¬†got‚Äù song. You with me?)

**Gratitude‚Äôs impact is often underestimated.
**[Study](https://www.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ac143-kumarepley28inpress29undervaluinggratitudepsychscience.pdf) participants who wrote gratitude letters ‚Äúsignificantly underestimated how surprised recipients would be about why expressers were grateful, overestimated how awkward recipients would feel, and underestimated how positive recipients would feel.‚Äù We hold back on expressing appreciation to others because we think it will be awkward, while the opposite is true: we have the chance to make someone‚Äôs day when we tell them why we‚Äôre grateful for them. (For more fodder on how out to lunch we are with what‚Äôll make us‚Äîand others‚Äîhappy, check out _[Stumbling on Happiness](https://www.randomhouse.com/kvpa/gilbert/)_ by Dan Gilbert ‚Ä¶ ideally the audiobook to fully appreciate his full-on funniness.)

**Gratitude goes hand in hand with corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the workplace.
**[Studies](https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/51162364/On_the_relationship_of_hope_and_gratitud20170103-21820-1gag1kg-with-cover-page-v2.pdf?Expires=1668029562&Signature=AUHHngNu7acos2TvY2vSVoxzEp3YN2vLuW6MNiiPomN-bqLp~RtWeceg83YAG5hC~EIFmU2To-s15oFMkmlX6PpokaiNc3P0SaK6JqstVlMUluT6gtCL-Hn8LP7Ruq6sVQ1OdODXyeOpfMvwn3YQT2EjqWsh0KcSjFldAB1AGGhMbelc3-1nRoVWu7zxu9PlpEGVcFRphKug7wu4oRIdMVKpvBpGRetpa7hc2o9GQNADZyjoSDmROq5DdOZuM8VRwRSpNoia8eo5bYcFpQALuYZ9fVH6Xq4XcGGWwqRtClCQZrNSNbeorM5HwNTNMxr9kBc9exIFBvx8HvbvG7CvGQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA) show that employees with feelings of gratitude have greater concerns for CSR and societal issues (and strangely no real sense of responsibility for economic and safety issues at work). Gratefulness ignites prosocial behavior ‚Ä¶ not so much on the profitability theme.

**![Big Bag 'o Money](https://fourthousandmondays.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-09-at-3.33.12-PM-221x300.jpg)Gratitude makes us less financially impatient.
**[Study](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/12185844/Lerner-GratitudeTool.pdf?sequence=1) participants who were primed to feel grateful evidenced greater patience in comparison to participants primed to feel happy or not primed for any emotion at all. ‚ÄúIn monetary terms, the mean grateful participant required $63 immediately to forgo receiving $85 in three months, whereas the mean neutral or happy participant required only $55 immediately.‚Äù This is particularly useful information if you are in the hock to a loan shark.

**Gratitude is relative to context.
**Gratitude is linked to social judgment, which means that our degree of thankfulness for financial loans or help with a task is relative to how much each friend contributes. [This study](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0021553) explains that we‚Äôre more grateful to the buddy who loans us _the most_ money (as compared to the other cheapskate friends who cough up less money), and that we‚Äôre more appreciative of the friend who spends _the most_ time helping us with a task (vs. the deadbeat friends who spend less time helping.) We really are awful.

**Gratitude is squashed by narcissism and cynicism.
**[Researchers](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760.2016.1163408) dug into the variables that might inhibit gratitude, and highlighted narcissism and cynicism as the ‚Äúthieves of thankfulness.‚Äù Makes sense, right? Narcissists believe they are entitled to everything, so therefore have little to be grateful for. Cynics suspect ulterior motives exist behind any gift, which puts a perma-dent in gratitude. (Materialism and envy were also noted as slight gratitude dampeners in the study.)

**![Grateful Monkey](https://fourthousandmondays.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-09-at-3.36.02-PM-300x283.jpg)Gratitude might exist in animals.
**The [evidence](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=zBZnDAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA213&dq=Gratitude+in+animals&ots=aBuM4qNNnP&sig=qlhmX2G4PTxFT_0uuaLvOEyn4DE#v=onepage&q=Gratitude%20in%20animals&f=false) is clear that reciprocal relationships exist in the animal kingdom (like the food-for-grooming economy that apes engage in: ‚ÄúIf you groom me this morning, and I come across food this afternoon, I‚Äôll toss you a few leaves and branches, mkay?‚Äù). It‚Äôs not clear, however, whether animals experience the actual emotion of gratitude during these moments of cooperation/ reciprocal exchange. Animals do not appear to record what they are thankful for in gratitude journals, for example. The research continues.

**![Memento Mori Coin](https://fourthousandmondays.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-09-at-3.38.06-PM-300x286.png)Gratitude boosts when we contemplate death.
**We spoke about this [in depth here](https://fourthousandmondays.com/a-bizarrely-unexpected-way-to-become-more-grateful-in-life/)‚Äî the fact that mortality salience (fancy psychology term for ‚Äúawareness that we‚Äôre gonna die‚Äù) wakes us up to the sanctity and scarcity of life.

**Gratitude might come from Mom.
**[Research](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-012-9386-7) has shown that a mother‚Äôs level of gratitude has a positive statistical relationship with her child‚Äôs level of gratitude, while ‚Äúfather gratitude demonstrated a consistent pattern of no relationship with child gratitude.‚Äù Great news! Your thankless Dad won‚Äôt rub off on you!

**Gratitude is a shapeshifter.
**This magical potion is an emotion, a personality trait, a moral virtue, a mood, a habit, a motive, a noun, a verb, and a way of life. Spending time learning about it and contemplating it is time well spent on the path towards the good life.

## A meta moment: appreciating gratitude

**Is it too corny for me to encourage us to be grateful for gratitude?** _(Yes? Oh, okay.)_ Other than memento mori (death reflection), I know of no more powerful concept in positive psychology to help us live fulfilling lives. What a fabulous intervention at our fingertips to activate any place, any time.**![Gratitude Journal](https://fourthousandmondays.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-09-at-3.17.06-PM-258x300.png)**

**Is it also too corny for me to thank YOU for reading this?** _(Yes? Oh, okay. \*Picture me dejectedly kicking the gravel\*)_ But really: I am grateful that you read this until the end (and maybe [more of my posts](https://fourthousandmondays.com/blog/) while you‚Äôre at it?). Writing is a lonely endeavor (pretty perfect for us introverts actually) so it helps to know I‚Äôm writing for more than just myself and my dear Dad who reads these posts every Monday like clockwork¬†üòä. _(Dad ‚Ä¶ I think I got my attitude of gratitude from you, despite research to the contrary.)_
