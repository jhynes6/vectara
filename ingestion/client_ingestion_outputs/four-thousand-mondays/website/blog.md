# The Blog

So many words, so little time.

## [You Are on a Crime Board, Honey](https://fourthousandmondays.com/you-are-on-a-crime-board-honey/)

You are on a crime board, honey. You're probably not the perpetrator on said board (but if you are a crime kingpin, I do love a good true crime story so please reach out and spill all your crimey beans to me). You are a victim-to-be on this board, and your face, last known address,...

## [Are You Surrounded by Dream Believers or Dream Cleavers?](https://fourthousandmondays.com/are-you-surrounded-by-dream-believers-or-dream-cleavers/)

A few weeks back I asked if you were a Dream Weaver or a Dream Leaver—you know, the type to pursue your goals and ambitions with fervor, or the type to leave your dreams in your dust because, well, it’s scary to risk failure and rejection and also there is some pretty good (i.e., distracting)...

## [On Being Chickensh*t About Feedback](https://fourthousandmondays.com/on-being-chickensht-about-feedback/)

I can’t bring myself to read my book reviews. Not even if I squint and try to scan— awkwardly with one eye—for kind words on Amazon and Goodreads reviews. I’m just too chickenhearted. You Only Die Once was published 500 days ago, which means I’ve spent the last 500 days in a row actively avoiding feedback....

## [The Secret to a Very Excellent Life: The 5 P’s](https://fourthousandmondays.com/the-secret-to-a-very-excellent-life-the-5-ps/)

Guess which piece of advice from my dear dad has turned out to be the secret to a very excellent life? A) Adhere to the “LIFO” method: Last In, First Out. (This is how we approached church as a family when I was growing up, thank God.) (Sorry, God.) B) Practice the 5 P’s: Proper...

## [Are You Settling in Your Life?](https://fourthousandmondays.com/are-you-settling-in-your-life/)

“Half a loaf of bread is better than no loaf at all.” What are your thoughts &/or feelings about this ancient proverb? A) I wholeheartedly agree! I don’t even need the half loaf—I’d even take a slice. Maybe even just the crumbs shaken out of the tray at the bottom of the toaster—I can try...

## [Are You Living a One-Dimensional Life?](https://fourthousandmondays.com/are-you-living-a-one-dimensional-life/)

"It matters to me that the thing I do for work is the least interesting thing about me." (*insert flabbergasted face*) A friend said this to me recently, and I knew she knew a thing or two about letting work play the dominant role in her life. She had lived a one-dimensional life for decades...

## [How Much Longer Are You Going to Wait?](https://fourthousandmondays.com/how-much-longer-are-you-going-to-wait/)

Last week I wrote a post called Are You a Dream Weaver or a Dream Leaver and I stirred some dream dust up out there. I love to rankle, because it’s the poke in the ribs that gets us moving towards our sizzley-but-scary goals… not so much the warm hug from a well-meant friend who...

## [Are you a Dream Weaver or a Dream Leaver?](https://fourthousandmondays.com/are-you-a-dream-weaver-or-a-dream-leaver/)

What is a Dream Weaver? Dream Weaver is a great song, obviously. Possibly about psychedelics, now that I’ve looked up the lyrics? Dream Weavers—despite the cheese-ball name—are people who fathom dreams and goals and ideas and plans and futures and don’t just sit there and take a bunch of psychedelics… they go to their loom...

## [Life Lessons from the Dead Cat Club](https://fourthousandmondays.com/life-lessons-from-the-dead-cat-club/)

Welcome to the Dead Cat Club. Dog lover? That’s fine. We’ll accept your membership application, but it might take longer to process. Here it is, the Monday after putting our dear, sweet, 18-year-old of a baby cat Andy down this past Friday. It wasn’t a great weekend. (We are going to have a discussion here...

## [A Collection of Your “Make Life Even Better” Ideas](https://fourthousandmondays.com/a-collection-of-your-make-life-even-better-ideas/)

They're real and they're spectacular. I love hearing from people like you who’ve read my posts about loving life (or maybe just liking life/ loathing life less) before we’re (*snap fingers*) gonzo—and then thought, “ooh! I want to share what I do to make this wild ride of life astonishing/ a little less nauseating.” Your...

## [All We Ever Wanted Was Everything: Yay or Nay?](https://fourthousandmondays.com/all-we-ever-wanted-was-everything-yay-or-nay/)

Standing in the offices of an impossibly cool Chicago interior design firm, about six years ago (back when we used to do hideous things like go to people’s offices to meet in person—remember those dumb days?), I stumbled across these words tacked up on my client Aimee’s wall: “All I Ever Wanted Was Everything.” The...

## [My Dad Has Dementia. I Have... Impatience and Guilt.](https://fourthousandmondays.com/my-dad-has-dementia-i-have-impatience-and-guilt/)

I haven’t been liking myself too much lately, and I think you might already know that. I’ve alluded to this Disdain for Self in other posts, on Instagram, ad nauseum to The Husband, again to The Husband, to friends, to The Husband again (how am I still married?), to my dental hygienist, to anyone who...
