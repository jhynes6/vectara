1976 – EST. 2067

## My mighty (and un-morbid) mission in life:

I’m here to help us make the most of our 4,000 Mondays on the planet … to not take life for granted, to not feel like we’ve squandered our time, to feel totally (and astonishingly!) alive … in both work and life.

# My Mission + The Grim Reaper

###### The pursuit of a zero-regrets life

I’ve made a lot of big life changes over the years because I knew I was wading into the waters of potential-deathbed-regret. I’ve changed careers, clients, relationships, habits, cities, homes, cocktail choices—all in pursuit of living a life I like/love, of staving off the “coulda shoulda woulda” troika of regrets and the boredom that stubbornly seeps in.

I’m a daily work in progress, to be sure. I don’t pretend to live an astonishingly alive life every day, and I don’t even want to astonish myself with my life every day. I do follow my own program though and know that if I don’t work diligently to build more vitality and meaning into my moments, I slip into autopilot in a hurry.

# Why am I so focused on this decidedly unpopular topic?

My Mom died in her 50s, which made life seem that much more temporary. But it was more than that. Her passing away jostled me awake, made me realize that I didn’t want to leave stones unturned and dreams unfulfilled (as she unfortunately did).

This mission is wholeheartedly about living—with vitality and meaning—not so much the dying part.

# The Fancy Credentials

###### (In case you care)

![Skully in a grad cap](https://fourthousandmondays.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Credentials2-Schooling.png)

##### The Schooling

**I have a Master of Applied Positive Psychology from the University of Pennsylvania…**

Which means I spent one of the best years of my life studying with the world’s top researchers on happiness and what makes life worth living. (That was actually what we studied—and now that I know/ paid handsomely for all of the answers, I can’t hold them in. This shit’s too good to keep a secret.)  
I’m now an Assistant Instructor in the master’s program. Woo hoo!

I’m a Certified Professional Co-Active Coach from CTI and was a PCC with the ICF until I realized I didn’t want to coach anymore, so there’s that.

##### The Corporatizing

**I have 25 years of executive leadership experience…**

So I get what it’s like to be swept off your feet by the amazingness of a meaningful job that fills you with energy, and also to have your soul snuffed out of you by a job that robs you of the chance to experience even a wee bit of joy.

I get what it’s like to have your role become your identity, to yearn for more but feel helpless as to what “more” even is—let alone how to get it, and to feel stuck in a comfort zone that isn’t even all that comfortable anymore (oh, the trappings of titles, seniority, dough, and a half-decent parking spot). I’m happy to say that I’m no longer a highly functioning zombie!

##### The Expertise

**I am (*pushes glasses up nose*) an expert on the science and practice of living before we die.**

I literally wrote the [book](https://fourthousandmondays.com/book/) on it! You Only Die Once: How to Make It to the End with No Regrets made Adam Grant’s Summer Reading List, and has a bunch of glitzy endorsements (like Dan Pink, Dr. Laurie Santos, Arthur C. Brooks, Martha Beck … the list gleefully goes on).

It’s my full-time job to [speak](https://fourthousandmondays.com/workshops-keynotes/) to corporations, associations, teams (and whomever’s sitting within earshot of me at dinner parties) on how to bust out of autopilot and live/ lead/ work with intention and aliveness. Keynotes, workshops … I speak to small teams on retreats all the way up to thousands stuffed into convention centers. We all need a reminder to wake up and live, and I’m the one to do it with gusto.

##### The Unfancy

**My version of aliveness isn’t (always) all that grand…**

Feeling alive can come from the simplest things for me—like Cadbury Creme Eggs that come but once a year, visits with my Dad, birding, planning a practical joke, or sketching a skull in under 30 tries to get it right. (I dare you to try and draw a half-decent skull, right now.)

I was born and raised near Toronto, and The Husband and our feline son (hi Andy!) now live in Palm Springs, California. I’ll be fine anywhere warm with the internet, a soft blanket, and a glass of alcohol. (That’s not as sad as it sounds.)

# The Press Stuff

###### (We all love our 15 minutes of fame, don’t we?)
