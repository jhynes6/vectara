## A Collection of Unexpectedly Inspiring Quotes About Death

You know how some quotes can paradoxically stop you in your tracks yet also jolt you into action? Still your beating heart in one moment, yet also quicken your pulse in an “I’M SO ALIVE” kind of way? Take your breath away yet simultaneously breathe oxygenated life into you? _(I really hope you know what I mean.)_

So I assembled my very favorite 58 morbidly motivating quotes, and here they are for you:

Here’s a warm up act to pique your interest:  
_“The idea is to die young as late as possible.” ~ Ashley Montagu_

P.S.: I couldn’t end this little Monday missive without sharing my favorite deathly quote of all time: _“Death is very likely the single best invention of life. It is life’s change agent.” ~ Steve Jobs_  
(Steve, even though I’ve read you were a little bit of a dick, I’ll love you forever for that quote. And your phones.)
