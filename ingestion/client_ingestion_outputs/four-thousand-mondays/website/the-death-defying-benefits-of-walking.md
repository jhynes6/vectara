# Let's Talk.

For speaking opportunities, please reach out to Jayme Boucher, Director of Hachette Speakers Bureau, at Jayme.Boucher@hbgusa.com or 212-364-1286. She’s great.

Otherwise, send me a note with questions, comments, existential musings, rants, &/or links to animal gifs … and I’ll get back to you in short order.

#### “This book is a breath of fresh air. Drawing on her training in positive psychology, Jodi Wellman has an utterly delightful way of making us smile while making us think. It’s a surprisingly fun and fruitful read about making the most of our scarce time.”

–Adam Grant, #1 New York Times bestselling author of HIDDEN POTENTIAL and THINK AGAIN, and host of the podcast Re:Thinking
