experiences

Never, ever  
a snooze fest

Unprecedentedly entertaining events that (unfatally) take your breath away.

### #1: How Many Mondays Do You Have Left?

The namesake event! This is the chance for audience members and teams to get clear about how they want their thousands or hundreds or dozens of Mondays left to BE. Shining the light on our scarcity of time has a funny way of doing that. Participants will reflect on what feeling Astonishingly Alive™ looks like for them, and will piece together a roadmap towards actually living that life. Audiences will get super-specific, inspired, and jolted into action from this motivating and memorable keynote/ interactive workshop.

### #2: What is Your Leadership Legacy?

This program is perfect for audiences with a desire to lead with greater intention, meaning, and purpose. If leaders are interested in shaping the kind of legacy they leave behind them in their role and organization, this session will provide a research-backed, inspirational, action-oriented approach to showing up as the kind of leader whose impact resonates and influences even after they're out of the picture. Participants will get strategic about their values, personal brand, and long-term vision that will outlast them for years to come.

# FAQs for the Curious Types

#### CAN YOU CUSTOMIZE A WORKSHOP OR KEYNOTE FOR MY GROUP?

Are you reading my mind? Of course I can! (Except on topics involving quantum physics or really anything having to do with sea mammals.) I regularly adapt my existing workshops and keynotes for clients, and also create new experiences from scratch. Let’s talk about what you have in mind.

#### WHAT IF WE WANT OUR WORKSHOP TO BE A RETREAT. DO YOU DO LONGER EVENTS?

Absolutely. Something special happens when people get away (even virtually!), because we can really go deep when we have the time. We can jam-pack as many of the Four Thousand Mondays interventions as time will allow. Let’s discuss how to build your perfect program.
