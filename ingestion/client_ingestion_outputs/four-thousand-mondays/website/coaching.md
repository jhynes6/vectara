# Coaching with Me

Coaching with me helps you wake up to your life

## When you want more, it helps to have help.

That help is right here, my friend. I’ve coached hundreds of clients over thousands of certified hours, ranging from 18 to 81 years young. We all need a little support to live lives worth living… regret-free lives that are both wide and deep.

# Common Reasons to Coach With Me

###### Personal Discovery

Seeing your life in a whole new light: getting clear on your purpose, values, goals, and how to get there. Epiphanatic.

###### Career Conundrums

Solving your work-related woes is an absolute must if you want to like your life. Gain confidence, skills and control.

###### Well-Being Building

Looking to thrive, feel energized and well-rounded in all the areas of your life? Well-being is a key to the good life.

###### The Wake-Up Call

For when life happens TO you (layoffs, divorce, illness, etc.), and you want to make living with resilience, vitality, and meaning a priority.

###### Maximal Aliveness

Committing even further to your already-awesome life: more motivation, more joy, more depth, more success, more gratitude, more creme brûlée.

###### Because You Can't Not

When coaching works, you kind of want to keep doing it. Lots of my clients are lifers, even if it's just a quarterly or yearly check-in.

Working with Jodi was a truly life-transforming experience that went above and beyond my initial goals of exploring my next career step and tackling a severe case of imposter syndrome. Jodi partnered with me as I went on an incredible learning journey of exploring different career paths. She championed me as I confronted my deepest blocks that were preventing me from living authentically in my career. Most importantly, I learned powerful positive thinking tools that have supported me in creating sustained change at my core that has enabled me to lead a happier and more fulfilled life.

Forward-thinking, active listener, and proactive are just a few words that come to mind when thinking of Jodi. Over the last year, I walked away from our coaching sessions feeling heard, affirmed, and with tangible next steps. It’s rare to find someone with such high experience in their field who also has the ability to guide and teach along the way, but Jodi accomplishes that – she’s highly skilled, and extremely personable. Jodi is a great asset to anyone seeking guidance on management, logistics, and human relations in the workplace.

I am heading up a new business and loved my experience with Jodi. She listens to my specific needs and developed a plan that suits me perfectly. Jodi truly cares about my success and that makes all the difference – her passion and meticulously quick witted approach works! I cannot thank Jodi enough for her encouragement, wisdom, and triumphantly solving my challenges. If you are looking for the BEST in career confidence, guidance and inspiration… she will not disappoint. Highly and happily recommended!

# Typical Steps to a Coaching Program

###### While no two coaching programs are alike, there is a method to the madness:

01 PRE-MORTEM

Learning about yourself in intricate, valuable detail

02 DREAMING

Guided process to define the life you’d love to lead

03 LIVING

The rubber of coaching meets the road of your life: live, learn, repeat

04 POST-MORTEM

Profound reflection on progress, tweaks, next steps in life

# FAQs for the Curious Types

#### IS COACHING VIRTUAL? CAN WE STILL DO IT IF I LIVE ON A REMOTE ISLAND?

Yes! And can I please visit you there? I connect with clients far and wide through the wonders of Zoom. The telephone works too.

#### WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE TO GET STARTED?

It’s easy! (Much easier than making risotto.)

1. You [book a call with me](https://calendly.com/jodiwellman/30min) to talk about what’s on your mind ([here](https://calendly.com/jodiwellman/30min)).
2. Assuming you don’t think I’m horrible after that call, we set up our deep-dive session date.
3. You sign a coaching agreement and make a payment (or payment installment) before our session.
4. You complete your “Pre-Mortem” Questionnaire, which provides fodder for our session together.
5. We do it! In our deep-dive coaching session we debrief the Pre-Mortem document you’ve filled out, and get focused on your goals/ dreams/ objectives.
6. You go off and live your newly-focused life, and we both celebrate your success (which means I’ll raise a glass of something bubbly for you from afar).

#### HOW MUCH DOES COACHING COST?

Always a great question.

Your coaching investment varies, depending on the program. Most of the programs I am doing with individuals now are deep-dive sessions of about two hours, and they start at $1,500.

Let’s talk about what’s right for you. Send me a note or give me a call. I’d love to talk with you.
