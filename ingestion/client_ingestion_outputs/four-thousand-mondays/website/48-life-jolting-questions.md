# 48 Life-Jolting Questions

Take a few hours out of your life, grab your drink of choice (coffee/ LaCroix/ White Russian/ whatever), get comfy, and answer as many questions as you can handle in the time you’ve allowed yourself.

If your answers inspire you to shift even one thing in your life for the better, then congratulate yourself and take action!

If your answers spark a wildfire of anxiety inside of you, then congratulate yourself for noticing that something needs changing, and take action! (Action. It’s a theme.) Life’s too short to squander it feeling anything else than alive– with vitality and meaning.

Happy un-dead-ifying your life. I’m here if you want to talk about being not dead yet.
