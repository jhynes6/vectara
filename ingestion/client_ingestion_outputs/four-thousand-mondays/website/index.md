# It's time to feel  
Astonishingly Alive™!

###### Keynotes + workshops that snap your team out of autopilot and bring back the zest …  
because vitally alive people do amazing work.

WHAT DOES 'VITALLY ALIVE' EVEN MEAN?

# Alive organizations create astonishing outcomes.

Team members with boosted vitality show up energized and ready to do their best work.  
Vitality at work isn’t about kale or yoga—it’s about energy that’s contagious, sustainable, and downright good for business. It’s what happens when people are alive at work, not just employed there.  
Think of vitality as momentum with a pulse—it’s the emotional spark plug that fuels creativity, collaboration, and resilience through the messy bits.  
Vitality goes beyond engagement and well-being. In a thriving workplace, engagement gets people to the meeting. Vitality makes them contribute with sparkle, not sighs.

OH, HOW I UNDERSTAND YOUR CHALLENGES.

# Feeling flatlined?

Ever feel like you're sleepwalking through your days?  
Maybe feel like your team is just 'going through the motions'—like highly functioning zombies?  
How about wanting to 'get a life' outside of work ... whatever that looks like?  
Maybe you're wondering how to bring the zest back ... and then how to retain the zesty ones?  
Leading a team and not sure how to light that spark of aliveness ... and is that even your job to do so?  
I hear you. And I can help.

# I'm Jodi Wellman, and I have 1,748 Mondays left.

I’m a former corporate executive who became a ‘stop squandering your life’ keynote speaker and author. I want us to make it to the end without a hint of “coulda shoulda woulda” regrets. I want us to live like we mean it … as though we’ve been warned that we will not last forever. You’re nodding with me, right?

YES, YOU AND YOUR GROUP CAN BECOME VITALLY ALIVE™ ...

# In 5 zest-inducing steps.

Rest assured: there is a process we dive into in my keynotes and workshops! '5 to Alive' is empirically based (phew), it's totally engrossing (because no one wants to participate in a workshop if it isn't fun or transformative), and best of all: it works.  
You and your group will walk away feeling inspired and motivated with an action plan to approach both work and life with urgency, passion, and enthusiasm.

# Ready to Bring This to Your Group?

###### (Of course you are.)

#### KEYNOTE PRESENTATIONS

Whether it’s 12 leaders in a boardroom or 5,000 people in an arena, my keynotes spark energy, ignite motivation, and leave audiences inspired to take action—with just the right mix of insight, humor, and heart.

#### WORKSHOPS

My workshops go deep—they’re interactive, thought-provoking experiences that move beyond inspiration into transformation. Perfect for teams ready to roll up their sleeves and explore what it really means to “live like you mean it”—together.

# Here's what to expect after my keynotes + workshops ...

##### Remarkable performance

Productivity fueled by burnout is borrowed time. Productivity fueled by vitality? That’s long-game leadership.

##### Juiced-up engagement

86% of high vitality employees are ready to work harder to help their workplace succeed, compared to 43% of low vitality workers.

##### Magnetic culture

One person with vitality can elevate a whole team. Energy is infectious—so is exhaustion.

##### Resilience under pressure

Vitality acts like shock absorbers. When people have inner resources, they don’t fall apart at every bump in the road.

##### Retention of the stars

People with vitality aren’t job hunting. They’re present, invested, and way less likely to mentally check out (or actually leave).

##### Creativity and innovation

Vital people are energized, not just efficient. They think in vivid color, not grayscale. You don’t get breakthrough ideas from burned-out brains.
