# So what's the deal with this online course?

THE MORBID TRUTH

# You’re dying of a sexually transmitted disease… _Life._

No secrets there… you’re a member of the terminal illness club with me and all the others. Since you’re living on borrowed time, how do you want the time you have left to actually BE?

# You live in a world obsessed with living longer.

You’re going to live twice as long as they did 100 years ago. Yay, progress!  But are you commensurately maxing out your experience of actually being alive? You’ll live longer, but are you also living wider and deeper?

# Your wider + deeper life.

A lack of vitality can lead to feeling meaningfully bored… a lack of meaning can lead to feeling vitally empty… and a lack of _both_ vitality and meaning pretty much always leads you to the dead zone _(gasp)_.

You make your life wider when you fill it with vitality and gusto– expanding the breadth of the pleasurable experiences that life has to offer while blasting yourself out of your autopilot tendencies.

You make your life deeper when you infuse it with meaning and purpose– elevating yourself out of an empty or mundane existence into a life that feels like it matters.

# Practicing Memento Mori reinvigorates your life.

Imagine waking up to your life with urgency, priority and meaning? Reflecting on the fact that you have an expiry date has so much less to do with the morbid and creepy parts about death and so much more to do with the profound opportunity to celebrate and focus on your aliveness and well-being.

#### INTRODUCING A 12-MODULE ONLINE COURSE

## Learn step-by-step how to grow into the version of your life that you’ve secretly been fantasizing about: the one jam-packed with vitality and meaning.

### The Pre-Mortem

The official kickoff to the rest of your “living-like-you-mean-it” life. You’ll learn where you stand with yourself: EXACTLY where you’re languishing, lacking, liking and loving your life today. We’ll measure your vitality, meaning, and degree of aliveness (or deadness). Structured reflections and assessments will help you get organized and draft a plan for what’s next.

### This Thing Called Your Life

The full-on exploration into _All Things You_: we dive into your values, purpose, strengths, ideal self (and so much more) to figure out EXACTLY what to do with the wealth of information you’ve amassed about yourself. Imagine a precise, intricate, deliberate, tweezer-like approach to dialing down the languishing and lacking, and dialing up the liking loving of your life. Unimaginably invigorating work.

### A Date with Death

Learn how Memento Mori (remembering you must die) can help you live like you have something worth dying for. We’ll reprioritize your hopes and dreams (in an inspiring, un-macabre way) and start shifting you into impactful action. Living the life you’ve imagined is entirely possible when you stop taking it for granted.

### Fears, Fables + Self-Judgment

How much does fear hold you back? Are the stories you tell yourself empowering or limiting, defined by scarcity or abundance? Learn how to identify the voice of the Grim Reaper in your head, along with his nine most common styles of self-sabotaging judgement…. and re-write a narrative that supports the life you’re after.

### Living Wider with Vitality

Learn the _Top Six Things that Can Snuff the Life Out of You_ in order to blast through boredom, rumple up your routines, and start living with a fresh approach. Learn the characteristics of the most vibrantly alive people (hint: novelty + pleasure) and participate in well-crafted exercises to experience so very much more in your life– starting _today._

### Living Deeper with Meaning

We go deep into the ways in which meaning, purpose, and engagement can enrich your life and deliver the replenishing gift of fulfillment. Cultivating meaning isn’t as elusive as it sounds, friends, so expect _meaningful_ reflections and activities in this module that will help you live a deeper life that matters from your first download click.

### Regrets: Those Little Assholes

Learn specific strategies on how to steer completely clear of the five most common regrets you’re likely to have on your deathbed. We’re “not old until regrets take the place of dreams,” so you’ll participate in assessments and interventions to live life fully now, without a hint of “if only” at the end.

### Your Inner Life

We explore the facets of well-being that go on behind the scenes in your head, and the best ways for you to maximize them on the path towards flourishing. You’ll delve into gratitude, anticipation, savoring, spirituality, contentment, choice, self-confidence… and so much more.

### Your Social Life

Explore your connections to other human beings (because it’s no surprise that they have a profound impact on your well-being). You’ll learn the latest research and you’ll take specific action steps to dramatically enhance the aliveness of your friendships and relationships.

### Your Productive Life

We dive into your work, achievements, strengths, growth + learning plan, financial + time management… just to name a few aspects of your _productive life_. How can you make the most of your productive self on the path towards living a life that you’re proud to call your own?

### Your Physical Life

Discover a way to feel most physically alive– inclusive of how you move, sleep, eat, take care of yourself, and actually like your body. You get to choose what aspects will invigorate you the most, and access an inner motivation to take healthy action. A vitally alive body helps you live wider and deeper.

### The Post-Mortem

The great, big, “so now what” of your life. We culminate your learning in the program, congratulate the crap out of you, design and solidify your own personal Memento Mori vitality + meaning plan moving forward, and unleash your astonishingly-alive-self out into the wild. Way to piss off the Grim Reaper.

# This program is perfect for you if:

##### You want to commit more to your life

And maybe you don’t know how (because who is ever taught to do _that_?)

##### You feel a little nervous about this

Because you are a normal human being, and what is new and different can feel a little daunting

##### You are a little more excited than nervous about this

The voice that says “live” is even just a wee bit louder than the one that says “wait”

##### You're all about learning + growing + self-actualization

I feel you! If you’re not green and growing, you’re ripe and rotting, right?

##### You're tempted by the idea of an adventure

This is the most respectable way to go on a life journey, without having to pack or get more vaccines

##### You don't want to die with 'what could have been' on your mind

Something about this conversation is nudging you… out of the land of regret and into the land of living

# FAQs for the Curious Types

#### HOW LONG IS THE PROGRAM, AND HOW MUCH TIME WILL IT TAKE ME TO GO THROUGH IT?

I like your organized approach, friend.

There are 12 modules, and they are designed to be taken at your own pace.

I recommend you progress through about one module per week, although you can slow it down if you need to. Zero judgement; the modules will be there waiting for you when you are ready.

Most participants spend 3 – 5 hours per week on the program (between watching the videos, completing the Guidebook exercises, reflecting, and living it up in general). I have met some “get ‘er done” folks who spend just two hours per module, and some folks who really take their time and go deeper.

You might find that some modules require more or less time than others. For example, the Inner Life module involves a gratitude exercise that you might zip through (or not!), while the Physical Life module involves activity challenges that might take more time (like a few hours per week of moving/ stretching/ pampering your body). (Does anyone else hate the word _pampering_?)

The bottom line is that you’ll never fall behind, and there is no “right” amount of time to complete the program. Living a life you love isn’t a linear process, right?

You’ll always have access to the course, too (as long as we’re both still alive) — so you can re-take the modules as often as you’d like!

#### WHAT IF I HAVE A BUSY TIME COMING UP AT WORK SOON. SHOULD I WAIT TO ENROLL?

You know what I’m going to say, right?

_Dive._

_Into._

_The._

_Deep._

_End._

_Of._

_The._

_Pool._

Why? Because life will always get in the way; it’s what it’s designed to do. I suggest that you take the plunge and work at your own pace. Show yourself that you’ve made a commitment and chip away at the content week by week, month by month. It will always be there for you.

#### WILL THERE BE GRADES AND QUIZZES?

Oh dear God, no. I am not a horrible person.

(Everyone gets an A+.)

#### WHAT IF I HAVE QUESTIONS ALONG THE WAY AS I'M COMPLETING THE PROGRAM?

That would make you really normal.

Members of this online program have dedicated support for any random tech or conceptual questions.

#### HOW DOES THE 100% SATISFACTION GUARANTEE WORK?

I am driven to make you happy (in life, and in the course).

If after completing the first four modules of the program, you are not finding the program to be the right fit for you, send me your completed Guidebook pages and a note that requests to cancel. We’ll then have a brief conversation about what didn’t float your boat, and I’ll process your refund.

I do ask that you complete the four modules within a two-month timeframe of registering for the program, so you officially give it the old college try before throwing in the towel _(love to mix metaphors)_.

I want you to succeed at this, and I’ll also still love you if you want to break up. We’ll do it amicably.

#### WHAT IF I STILL HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROGRAM?

By all means, send a note to info@fourthousandmondays.com and I’ll be SO happy to answer your question(s).

#### YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS COURSE.
