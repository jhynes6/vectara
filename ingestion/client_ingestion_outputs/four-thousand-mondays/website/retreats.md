# Memento Mori Retreats

###### Things you need to know about

##### A Scheduled Break

Sometimes you need a formal break to gain new, valuable perspectives on how you want to live your life.

##### Dark Tourism

Traveling (literally or figuratively) to death-inspired locations leads to ripe contemplation of what matters.

##### Rooted in Science

Trust that retreat curriculum is based on empirically-based studies. Think mind-blowing AND grounded.

# The Goodness of Retreating Away

###### Even if it’s virtual…

Three Days Away

The most memorable days you’ve likely ever had in your life.

Fill of Vitality + Fun

Don’t let death talk fool you: this retreat is really all about being alive.

Intimate Group Size

Imagine being in a group where you’re not just a number.

Full of Meaning

Not just about the width of experience… it’s about the depth of meaning, too.

Solo Time Built In

Because sometimes you just want to be with yourself, and that’s okay.

Healthy Lifestyle

Everything in moderation– including movement, rest, food, wine + chocolate.

# FAQs for the Curious Types

#### DO YOU OFFER VIRTUAL RETREATS?

ABSOLUTELY.  
While my preference is to offer high-end destination retreats that allow us to visit fascinating dark-tourism sites, e-treats can be just as impactful.  
I’ve found a way to make great things happen online. Let’s talk.

#### DO YOU OFFER CUSTOMIZED RETREATS FOR GROUPS?

That’s kind of my jam. I do full-on retreats, wee-treats (like, one-dayers), and e-treats on demand. Let’s talk about what you have in mind for your group … we can come up with something impactful and memorable—and best of all, you’ll be the hero for having arranged it all.

#### WILL PEOPLE BE FREAKED OUT BY A LOT OF DEATH STUFF?

I get asked this a lot, and I’m pleased to say I’ve never had anyone leave an event anything less than appreciative of the experience. We do engage in interesting interventions that get people thinking about death, and it is powerful. People often feel big feelings, think deep thoughts, and take action in their lives as a result of the exercises they participate in. It’s kind of the whole intention. It’s worth it.
