# Ethanol Extraction: Unleashing the Full Potential of Cannabis

The use of completely undenatured alcohol, such as CDA 12A, has become increasingly popular in the world of cannabis extraction. This type of alcohol, also known as pure alcohol or anhydrous alcohol, is alcohol that has not been denatured with any other substances. Because of its high purity and efficiency, it has become a popular choice for extractors looking to create high-quality cannabis extracts.

One of the key advantages of using completely undenatured alcohol, such as CDA 12A, for cannabis extraction is its high purity. Because it has not been denatured with other substances, it leaves behind no toxic residues in the extract, making it a safe and effective solvent. This is particularly important for medical cannabis patients, who may be sensitive to contaminants in their medication.

Another advantage of using completely undenatured alcohol, such as CDA 12A, for cannabis extraction is its efficiency. Alcohol is able to extract a wide range of compounds from the cannabis plant, including cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids, and other beneficial compounds. This allows for the creation of full-spectrum extracts that contain the full range of compounds found in the plant. In contrast, other extraction methods may only be able to extract a limited range of compounds, resulting in extracts that are less potent and less effective.

In addition, completely undenatured alcohol, such as CDA 12A, is a versatile solvent that can be used to extract compounds from a variety of plant materials. This makes it a useful tool for creating extracts from different strains of cannabis or even from other plants.

One potential disadvantage of using completely undenatured alcohol, such as CDA 12A, for cannabis extraction is that it can strip some of the more delicate compounds from the plant material. This can result in extracts that lack some of the flavors and aromas found in the original plant. However, this can be mitigated by using low temperatures and carefully controlling the extraction process.

Overall, the use of completely undenatured alcohol, such as CDA 12A, for cannabis extraction offers several benefits, including high purity, efficiency, and versatility. This makes it a popular choice for extractors looking to create high-quality cannabis extracts. Whether you're a medical patient seeking a pure and potent extract, or a small-scale extractor looking for an affordable and versatile extraction method, CDA 12A may be worth considering.
