A Convention and Visitor’s Bureau needed help with increasing tourism for sporting events, hiking and a historical museum.

Overview 
A small municipality needed help hiring for their police force. They partnered with Amplified because of a longstanding print relationship, but the scope of their hiring efforts exceeded beyond our local markets. A digital strategy was put in place to reach 3 nearby DMAs, to saturate these markets heavily for a 4 week blitz campaign. This campaign was so successful in bringing in prospective recruits that a second campaign was started 6 months later for an additional hiring need.

Testimonials

Our rep makes all the difference. I know that she's going to bat for me to guarantee that my ads get placed exactly when, where and how I want. Without her, I'm not sure what we'd be doing.

Marketing Director, Western Interlock

When we started working with the Amplified team several years ago we had not done any SEM and knew little to nothing about Programmatic Display advertising. The Amplified team took the time to educate us on these technologies and helped us create a program to test the waters in these types of advertising. We were able to learn as we went and, as we saw positive results, we continued to build on it a little more each year. They have continually kept us updated on new technologies and new opportunities. Each year we have been able to review what’s working, make adjustments, and add items that made sense for us. Most recently this included incorporating video ads into the mix. We have been very happy with the service and results we have seen from our digital advertising program with Amplified.

There are so many reasons that I love working with the team at Amplified. One of the main reasons is the way they take my wild ideas and make them a reality! Whenever I think of something unique or out of the box, I tell the team, “I’m sure this is possible, I just don’t know how to do it on my own,” and they dig in to figure out a way to make it happen, they have come up with something every single time! From an idea for a product app that we built from the ground up, to simple yet effective tweaks to our digital advertising campaigns, I know that I can trust the team to work on my brand’s behalf to produce exactly what we need for success.

Amplified Digital was a great partner when it came time to run our police recruitment. Traditional recruiting efforts were no longer successful in bringing the necessary applicants to our application portal. We worked to develop an applicant profile that they used to find our next hires. We saw a near 1-to-1 click over rate from their data to our job portal. The result was our largest applicant pool in eight years. Their staff regularly updated our progress and tracked how our campaign was doing against industry benchmarks. The campaign that Amplified Digital built was a critical piece of our success with that recruitment.

We've been working with Amplified Digital for over 7 years. At that time, we had one location and knew how important digital marketing was to grow our business in the age of Google, Facebook, and Social Media. With Amplified, we've been able to gain a significant ROI on our investment in marketing through patient volume and revenue growth. Amplified is an agency that understands business and are able to deliver growth and successful results. With the expertise of this team we have been able to complete a number of acquisitions and grow location counts to over 18+ locations and expand into many different service lines. The knowledge and attention to detail that Amplified has provided has aided in keeping our company on track even through this COVID-19 pandemic. They are able to react quickly to anything that needs changing if necessary. I am highly confident in recommending Amplified Digital’s marketing services.

I chose to partner with Amplified nearly five (5) years ago to manage my SEO, SEM, pay-per-click, retargeting ads, video ads, display ads and all other digital marketing for my nine-store operation in Eastern Iowa and Western Illinois.  Since partnering with Amplified our engagement and analytics have all significantly increased and this has led to overall growth in sales for our retail flooring business.
The Amplified team is deep with dedicated talent.  While I meet with department heads on a regular basis to review the overall effectiveness of our digital media plan, I know there are many staff members assigned to my account.  The Amplified team continuously works to see which parts of our digital plan is working well and where areas can be improved.  They are always quick to make suggestions to improve the performance of the digital plan, as well as, introduce new concepts / ideas as the digital media world is always changing and adapting.  The Amplified team is very proactive and takes pride in their results.  They provide a detailed analytics report that tracks each and every part of our digital media campaign.  The team is also very quick to implement any new ideas and strategies to improve the overall success of our digital media.

Amplified Digital is a wonderful team to work with. They base our client relationship on a partnership mindset, if our businesses are successful, they are successful. I work directly with Ashley Szymczak and she has been a fabulous extension of our digital marketing team. Ashley quickly replies to questions and gets our campaigns entered for launch. 

The best part about working with Amplified is their honest opinions on maximizing our advertising based on budgets and goals. They always come with options, making comparing outcomes much easier. I highly recommend Amplified Digital to anyone looking to up their programmatic game.

I have worked with Amplified Digital for many years now. I love the partnership I have with my account reps. 
We have monthly calls to discuss reporting on my digital tactics which help to drive personalized strategy and maximize the performance of my campaigns. I also appreciate that they offer a variety of services including Google AdWords, paid social media, website maintenance, etc. that allow me to execute multiple tactics with one company. They suggest new tactics that might be beneficial for my business and I am able to rework budget as one campaign might grow stale allowing me to test something new. Our monthly calls not only cover performance but offer competitive data in order to stay ahead of the market and ensure our campaigns are effective. I would highly recommend Amplified Digital. 
I fully trust that my campaigns are being properly managed to the max performance capability.
