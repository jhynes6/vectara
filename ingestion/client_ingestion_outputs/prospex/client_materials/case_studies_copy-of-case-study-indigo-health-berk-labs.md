Indigo Health Clinic
Indigo Health Clinic is a wellness clinic in Washington D.C. offering a range of big-ticket services, from scar therapy to pain management and beauty services.
The Client


Indigo has big ambitions. Not satisfied with their local market, they wanted to increase their global reach and move their reliance away from services by expanding to offer mail-in test kits and self-administered therapies that could be sold online. This included a new line of wellness supplements (with 20+ SKUs) to grow their top-line revenue and diversify their income.

The Problem
Case Study
Indigo Health Clinic

Unfortunately, their systems weren’t built to accommodate online products or services and their current campaigns were costly, not built to scale, and inflexible. Customer information was also spread across several systems, making it impossible to analyze and interpret effectively.

Indigo needed to maximize their awareness for these new product SKUs and digital services. Beyond expertise in Google systems, they also needed help with a diverse range of online advertising projects (Facebook and YouTube ads, CRM, Active Campaign), operations integration, and streamlining of their digital workflow. 

It was a huge project.

The Problem
Case Study / Indigo Health Clinic

Some clients want to be trained in how to do it for themselves while others simply want the results and a long-lasting relationship. 

For Indigo, BERK Labs was happy to provide both the results and the training to help the owners understand and manage their marketing. 

After analyzing Indigo’s systems and setup, the BERK Labs’ team identified two steps that would need to be addressed for Indigo to reach its goals.

The Solution
Step 1Tools And Technology Evaluation
To begin, the team started with a frank and in-depth discussion to explore Indigo's needs in detail, making sure to examine issues that might arise once the most pressing matters had been attended to. 

During these conversations, the team discovered that Indigo’s online scheduling systems couldn’t identify when an ad had resulted in a booking — a vital function to inform their future marketing efforts.

Indigo’s CRM and Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems were not integrated with each other either, nor with any other marketing systems, meaning priceless marketing data was being left on the table every day. Their EHR system was tightly linked to their scheduling system, so that had to be changed too.

Because nothing was obvious in this project, everything required a careful eye and an open discourse with Indigo to make sure BERK Labs were fully informed every step of the way. The team conducted thorough and extensive research on all possible alternatives and made evaluations for how each alternative tool would best fit into Indigo’s business requirements.

The Solution

At this point, BERK Labs decided to take a more ambitious approach — a complete replacement of their back end system to ensure it would integrate seamlessly with, and even automate, marketing processes — saving Indigo time and money. 

This was where BERK Labs’ attention to detail and creative approach to problem-solving paid off. What had started as a simple tune-up had become a full engine replacement, employing the latest technology to reduce costs and raise efficiency at every stage in the customer lifecycle, from awareness to acquisition to retention and everything in-between.

The Solution

The team eventually settled on a series of systems that integrated seamlessly with each other: Patient Records (an advanced & modern EHR/EMR), ActiveCampaign (Email & CRM), Zapier (Marketing Automation), and CallRail (Call Tracking). 

This gave Indigo a powerful and solid foundation to propel the company to new heights without wasting resources.

Step 2 Designing Online Strategy
When the internal systems had been installed and integrated with other relevant systems, BERK Labs needed an online strategy that would raise Indigo’s brand awareness and product sales to support their efforts in moving away from a purely service-based business model. Indigo didn’t have endless resources to spend which meant the BERK Labs team would have to be inventive with their targeting and construction of Indigo’s funnel.

The Solution

For most businesses, online marketing is so competitive and so complex that they can’t afford to not be an expert on day one. It simply costs too much money to learn on the job. By leveraging the expertise of an agency like BERK Labs, however, companies can reap the rewards of expertise immediately, while upskilling simultaneously.

Designing Online Strategy

Indigo’s main challenge here was in marketing cost-effectively, as their resources were limited. The BERK Labs team focused on the top and bottom of the funnel, the most effective areas, focusing on improving performance and reducing waste. 

Using ActiveCampaign, the team shaped the customer journey in a highly collaborative process, creating campaigns that were triggered by specific actions on Indigo’s website. For example, a customer viewing Indigo’s chelation therapy service would receive email marketing about chelation therapy while someone who visited the website but didn’t purchase anything would receive remarketing ads targeting their preferences. 

But BERK Labs wasn’t done yet....

Designing Online Strategy

“Before BERK Labs, we didn't know much about our Google Ads accounts; how it really functioned, or how we could improve it. Thanks to BERK Labs, we do now.”

Video Marketing:
The most powerful and cost-effective element of the BERK Labs strategy was the video marketing they leveraged to support Indigo’s ambitions without the need for extensive resources.

Because of YouTube’s enormous and constantly growing inventory and low competition, video marketing offers a low cost and high engagement option when compared with traditional advertising. The only problem for Indigo, as is common for small businesses, was a lack of video assets they could use for promotion.

The Solution

BERK Labs employed software that allowed Indigo to create video assets cheaply in weeks, not months, using the software’s powerful, yet simple features. Indigo was now able to effectively advertise to potential customers for 1/10th of the traditional cost of online advertising, supercharging the top of their customer acquisition funnel. 

YouTube advertising is powerful not just because of its cost-effectiveness but also due to its reach — YouTube reaches more people between ages 18-34 than any US TV network, on any channel. When you couple this powerful reach with the precise pinpoint targeting that BERK Labs employs in every marketing campaign, you have an incredibly effective and affordable marketing tool. 

Once BERK Labs had integrated this into the marketing plan, other clinics couldn’t keep up with Indigo’s performance.

BERK Labs’ system integration was a success; automating a huge array of processes often related to data entry. 

This enabled Indigo to drastically lower the amount of time employees spent on administrative tasks and instead focus on more profitable behaviors like upselling customers. The BERK Labs team also refined Indigo’s campaigns, and successfully launched their online products and services, which enabled them to move away from their reliance on local business, as planned.
