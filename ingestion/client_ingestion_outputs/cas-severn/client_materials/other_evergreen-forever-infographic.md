Rethinking Mid-range vs Enterprise Storage

Legacy data storage, with its complexity, forklift upgrades and limited “mid-range” 
features, is a relic of the past. Pure Storage is more feature-rich, more cost-effective, 
more agile, and radically easier to use. Here’s a closer look at what makes Pure better.

The Capabilities You Need, Now and in the Future

Artificial boundaries between “enterprise” storage and “mid-range” don’t make sense. 
The kinds of features that you have to pay extra for (and do a disruptive forklift 
upgrade to get) from legacy storage vendors are all included in your 
Evergreen Storage™ subscription—even new ones that we keep adding.

Included Features

How You Benefit

Synchronous replication 
(ActiveCluster™)

from ransomware attacks

all your workloads

Disruptive Downtime Is a Thing of the Past

Upgrading and expanding legacy storage means shutting down your 
workflows. Pure Storage lets you buy storage once and enjoy 
upgrades and new features without disruptions of any kind.
