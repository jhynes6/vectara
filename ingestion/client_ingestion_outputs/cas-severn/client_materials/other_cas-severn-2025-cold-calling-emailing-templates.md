Infrastructure Script 

Hi Name, this is Kellen with Pure Storage, How is it going? 

I’ll be brief, with Pure we are a large All-Flash storage provider both on-prem and in the cloud. 
We work with over half of the fortune 500 companies. We are doing some unique work within 
the storage industry regarding our Evergreen Architecture and our storage as a service offering.  

I'm just looking to ask you a couple of quick questions and see if Pure could be of value to you 
and your team.  

Would that be fair? 

Questions: 

●  When speaking with clients similar to your organization, we are seeing that migration 

data is a highly stressful moment for them because of the high risk of critical data loss. 
Are you feeling that way? 

●  Are you tasked to ask the business to get budget approval for big capital investments 

every 3 years.  

●  Do you currently have to fork-lift upgrade your storage investment every 3-5 years? 

●  Do you have to migrate your data every time you have to get new gear? 

●  Would holding onto your cash, with much less upfront cost and being able to allocate 

those savings to other IT projects be beneficial for you? 

Other generic questions: 

●  What storage provider are you currently with? 
●  Why did you choose that vendor? 
●  How is your experience with them? 
●  What are some challenges you have with them?  
●  What is something you wish they could do differently? 
●  When is your contract up with them? 
●  Have you heard of Pure before? 
●  Do you have to migrate your data every time you have to get new gear? 

Close: 
The Evergreen architecture was designed by Pure Storage to enable continuous upgrades of 
storage controllers and flash without downtime or uninterrupted access to critical applications 
and workloads. 

Could we find some time this week to take a dive deeper?

Email 1: Discussing Your Upcoming Storage Refresh Projects 

Hi [Recipient's Name], 

I thought you would be a great person to chat with about your upcoming storage refresh projects 
at [COMPANY]. 

At Pure Storage, we are an 11x Gartner Leading All-Flash data storage provider. What sets us 
apart from other storage solutions is our Evergreen Architecture and our storage-as-a-service 
offering. This means that once you buy storage from us, you will never have to undergo another 
forklift migration again. 

Additionally, our Evergreen Architecture ensures that your storage system remains modern and 
non-disruptive, with no planned downtime or data migrations, protecting your investment and 
reducing total cost of ownership. 

Would you be open to a conversation next week to discuss future opportunities? 

Best,  

Email 2: RE: Discussing Your Upcoming Storage Refresh Projects 

Hi [Recipient's Name], 

Following up on my note below regarding your upcoming storage refresh initiatives. 

We understand the pain and challenges of having to rebuy hardware, software, migration 
services, and dealing with rising renewal costs every 3-5 years. 

97% of Pure Arrays purchased 7 years ago are still in production because of our Evergreen 
Architecture. With our flat and fair subscription costs, we make it easy for you to plan for the 
future. We provide free non-disruptive controller and software upgrades, significantly reducing 
the total cost of ownership for your on-premise storage. 

Would it be worth a conversation if I told you that you would never have to go through another 
forklift migration ever again if you chatted with our team? 

Best,
