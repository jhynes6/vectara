Easy, High 
Performance AI  
for Healthcare  
and Life Sciences

Simple,	scalable	AI	infrastructure		
from	Pure	Storage	and	NVIDIA	

Healthcare	and	life	sciences	are	embarking	on	an 	artificial	intelligence	(AI)	

revolution.	Impacts	are	occurring	in	all	areas:	patient	care,	drug	research, 	

hospital	administration,	payer	services,	and	more.	McKinsey	 notes	there	

may	be	a	collective	opportunity	starting	point	of	over	$1	trillion. 	

Healthcare	and	life	sciences	(HCLS)	organizations	will	tap	the	power 	of		

AI	for	faster	innovation	and	a	competitive	edge.	Yet	AI 	requires	a	

completely	new	infrastructure.	The	complexities	of	legacy	solutions	are 	

holding	HCLS	back	from	moving	into	the	new	era	of	intelligence.	AIRI ®,	

a	joint	solution	from	Pure	Storage	and	NVIDIA,	offers	an	easy	to	deploy, 	

scalable	AI	solution	that	helps	speed	your	time	to	insight	and	value.

Adding Value with Additional Solutions

While	the	combination	of	FlashBlade//S	and	NVIDIA	is	the	ideal	pairing	for 	high	performance	AI 	processing,	not	all	data 	

requires	top-of-the-line	storage	performance.	For 	longer-term	data	retention,	Pure	Storage	offers	 FlashBlade//E™,	capacity-

optimized	file	and	object	storage	that	gives	you	the	density	and	energy	saving	benefits	of	all-flash	at	a	price	point	similar

	to	

disk-based	storage.	

AI	workflows	are	increasingly	being	run	via	containers	and	Kubernetes	to	achieve	better	scale,	performance	and	resiliency.

Portworx®	by	Pure	Storage	is	a	Kubernetes-native	storage	management	platform	that	greatly	simplifies	cloud-native	projects. 	

It	provides	persistent	storage	for 	AI	workloads	with	easy	developer 	self-service.	And	Portworx	simplifies	the	task	of	the	IT 	

department	by	providing	enterprise	services	such	as	high-availability,	backup,	disaster 	recovery,	roles-based	access	controls 	

and	much	more.	

Pure	Storage	has	partnered	with	 NVIDIA	DGX-Ready	software 	partners	like	Weights	&	Biases	and	Run:ai	to	optimize	the 	

MLOps	stack	for 	efficient	GPU	utilization,	improve	developer 	velocity,	and	more.	Moreover,	our 	upcoming	Gen	AI 	RAG	

reference	architectures	will	help	our	HLCS	customers	accelerate	Generative	AI	applications	in 	their	user	journeys	to	solve	

critical	pain	points	like	quicker 	and	more	accurate	clinical	diagnoses	and	faster	drug	discovery.

Optimized Infrastructure Is Essential to AI

AI	adoption	is	on	the	rise	across	HCLS,	yet	most	organizations	lack	the	necessary	infrastructure	to	handle	the	high-

performance	data	demands	and	energy	requirements	essential	for	maximizing	its	benefits.	This	limitation	poses	a	challenge	to 	

the	successful	implementation	of	AI	to	support	critical	healthcare	initiatives. 	

Pure	Storage	conducted	a	survey 1	that	found	that	for 	88%	of	those 	who	have	adopted	AI,	the	need	for 	computing	power	

has	surged	dramatically.	In	fact,	nearly	3	in 	4	IT	buyers	(73%)	whose	companies	have	implemented	AI	were	not	completely 	

prepared	for	the	energy	requirements.	As	a	result,	nearly	all	respondents	(96%)	have 	already	or	plan	to	update	their 	IT	

infrastructure,	including	29%	who	say	it	has	or	will	require	a	complete	overhaul.

Right	now,	the	vast	majority	of	data	in	data	centers—over 	80%—remains	trapped	on 	magnetic	hard	disks.	Shifting	to	flash-

optimized	systems	is	a	preliminary	step	organizations	can 	take	to	reduce	power 	and	space	usage	between 	five	and	ten	

times.	Pure	Storage	arrays	use	up	to	85%	less	power 	than	competitive	all-flash	systems.	And	the	Pure//E ™	family	of	arrays	are 	

available	at	a	price	point	equivalent	to	disk,	with	a	60%	lower 	TCO	over	time.	Pure	Storage	arrays	can	dramatically	reduce	your 	

power	needs,	freeing	up	both	rack	and	data	center 	power	resources	to	allow	for 	AI	compute	expansion.

**Adding Value with Additional Solutions**

The combination of FlashBlade//S and NVIDIA is ideal for high-performance AI processing, but not all data requires top-tier storage. For long-term data retention, Pure Storage offers FlashBlade//E, which provides the density and energy savings of all-flash storage at a cost similar to disk-based storage.

AI workflows are increasingly using containers and Kubernetes for better scalability and performance. Portworx by Pure Storage is a Kubernetes-native storage management platform that simplifies cloud-native projects, offering persistent storage for AI workloads and enterprise services like high availability, backup, and disaster recovery.

Pure Storage has partnered with NVIDIA DGX-Ready software partners to optimize the MLOps stack, enhancing GPU utilization and developer efficiency. Their upcoming Gen AI RAG reference architectures aim to accelerate generative AI applications, aiding in clinical diagnoses and drug discovery.

**Optimized Infrastructure Is Essential to AI**

AI adoption is rising, especially in healthcare and life sciences (HCLS), but many organizations lack the infrastructure to meet performance demands. Pure Storage found that 88% of AI adopters need more computing power, with 73% of IT buyers unprepared for energy requirements. Consequently, 96% plan to update their IT infrastructure, with 29% considering a complete overhaul.

Currently, over 80% of data in data centers is on magnetic hard disks. Transitioning to flash-optimized systems can reduce power and space usage significantly. Pure Storage arrays use up to 85% less power than competitors, offering a lower total cost over time and freeing up resources for AI expansion.
