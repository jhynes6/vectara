Hi, this is Kellen from Pure Storage. How are you doing today? 

I'll keep it brief—I help organizations accelerate their AI initiatives by simplifying 
data infrastructure and removing bottlenecks to unlock faster insights and 
innovation.  

Would it be okay if I asked a few questions to understand your current AI plans 
and potential challenges you may be facing? 

What is your role and responsibilities when it comes to AI projects? 

What are your AI goals? (What do you mean goals)- Like are you building a 
product, or building tools to be more efficient internally? 

Are you running these AI projects in the cloud or on-prem or hybrid? 

Are you running into any infrastructure roadblocks that are slowing your 
team down or increasing costs? 

I'm curious, are you noticing any challenges in your data or analytics 
workflows—especially around scaling, performance, or managing growing 
datasets? 

Thank you for sharing and we have seen that many customers hit speed bumps 
with AI projects: either slow data access, complex upgrades, and systems that 
just don’t scale easily. 

With Pure Storage we power AI with our unified, high-performance all-flash 
storage—streamlining file and object data access at every stage, scaling 
easily without disruptive upgrades, and delivering ultra-low latency and 
massive parallelism to keep data and GPUs running full speed all while 
keeping costs low.  

Could we schedule in the coming weeks for you to meet one of my AI specialists 
to have a deeper discussion? 

As more companies invest in AI, I've seen frequent issues like slow model 
training, siloed data pipelines, and complex infrastructure management holding 
teams back from moving quickly and getting value from their AI projects.
