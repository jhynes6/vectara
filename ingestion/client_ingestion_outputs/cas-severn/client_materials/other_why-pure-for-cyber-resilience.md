Accelerate Recovery 
with Pure Storage 
Cyber Resilience 

Minimize downtime and business disruption

Cyberattacks, especially ransomware, can cripple operations for days 

or weeks, but most organizations need to recover critical applications 

and services within 12-24 hours. The longer an organization takes to 

recover, the greater the loss of customer trust and brand reputation and 

competitors may gain market share if services remain unavailable. And 

regulatory penalties (HIPAA, GDPR, SEC, etc.) escalate if organizations 

fail to restore data quickly and securely. Adding to the problem is that 

downtime is extremely costly, especially to enterprise-scale organizations, 

where. Organizations can incur downtime costs of approximately $9,000 

per minute, which translates to roughly $540,0000 per hour (Forbes).

Challenges of Cyber Resilience

Many organizations rely on disaster recovery technology, processes and policies to 

recover from ransomware attacks. These fail to address the complexities of cyber 

recovery, including the need to quickly provision isolated recovery environments 

critical for fast and reliable recovery. Further, backup storage for the most critical 

applications typically operates on legacy or outdated technology, creating a 

bottleneck to rapidly provision data for the recovery processes. And before the attack 

occurs, many security analytic tools, such as SEIM and UEBA, lack insights from 

mission-critical storage and struggle to analyze the massive volume of security alerts 

generated by network, endpoints, storage and servers.

Solution Overview

Visibility and resilience are the foundation for effective cyber resilience. Visibility ensures you understand your data storage 

attack surface, get control of your data security safeguards and monitor your data for threats. Layered resilience from 

Pure Storage leverages a combination of immutable and indelible data snapshots, data replication, streaming data protection 

and DRaaS to ensure data availability against evolving cyber threats, giving you the power and performance to recover from 

simple outages to complex and destructive cyber attacks.

The Pure Storage platform, featuring FlashArray™ and FlashBlade® systems, meets diverse requirements with high-performance 

unified block and file services running on a single storage pool. It consolidates disparate workloads, scales to petabyte levels 

in an ultra-dense footprint, and offers advanced data reduction with intelligent deduplication and compression, effectively 

replacing legacy disk-based storage.

Security and recovery innovations such as SafeMode™ Snapshots, zero trust security functions, anomaly detection, and rapid 

remediation and recovery are integrated into our platform. Combined with stringent service level agreements (SLAs), these 

features ensure that Pure Storage not only protects data and aids threat detection, but also enables swift, seamless recovery 

in the face of threats. Pure1® tools further empower organizations through proactive assessments, offering a Data Protection 

Assessment and Security Assessment to optimize and refine security strategies. And with Pure Protect™ //DRaaS, you can 

enhance your incident response strategy and complement your backups, snapshots, and replication, giving you an extra 

recovery site for unmatched resilience.

Pure Storage boosts cyber resilience for data protection vendor customers by delivering high-performance, immutable 

storage that shields critical data from ransomware and threats. Integrated with solutions like Veeam, Commvault and Rubrik, 

it enables rapid, non-disruptive recovery and real-time data visibility, minimizing downtime, enhancing security, and ensuring 

business continuity.

 And to improve security operations, customers can leverage Pure Storage security partner integrations to accelerate threat 

detection and analysis, enabling rapid incident response, and effective remediation.
