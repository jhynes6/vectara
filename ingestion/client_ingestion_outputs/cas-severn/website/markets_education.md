## Education

### WE KNOW HOW TO WORK WITH EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS

In a tough economy, you need to work with solutions you already have to make them fit your needs. CAS Severn has the creativity and expertise to help you get the most out of your current solutions.

In education, sometimes IT solutions need to be implemented over a few budget cycles. We can help you make sure you have a plan to get an entire project completed within your budget.

Prior to making any technology recommendations, the CAS Severn team will take the time to understand your current IT environment, identify any gaps, and help you develop a short-term and long-term plan of action.

CAS Severn is a conference sponsor for the Association of Collegiate Computing Services of Virginia (ACCS) and the Maryland Education Enterprise Consortium (MEEC).

### GDPR FOR HIGHER EDUCATION — IS YOUR INSTITUTION READY FOR GDPR?

The GDPR applies to any organization established outside of the EU that processes any personally identifiable data about residents of the EU in specific instances.

This language is quite broad and will conceivably cover almost any website on the Internet that is globally available, offers goods or services, and collects personal information of any kind.

It is anticipated that the GDPR will apply to U.S. institutions in a variety of scenarios, including institution-controlled public-facing websites that offer goods or services, any websites that track personally identifiable user information or behavior, student study abroad programs, and potentially any research about residents of the EU that could in some way identify them.

For example, enrollment activities may be covered under the GDPR if an institution is targeting or enrolling people located in the EU and the institution collects personal data about those individuals during the enrollment or recruitment process.
