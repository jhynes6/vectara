### EASE OF DOING BUSINESS WITH CAS SEVERN

We understand the needs of government agencies, how to efficiently navigate the purchasing process and how to speak the language.

CAS Severn’s contract vehicles with the General Services Administration (GSA) and the Chief Information Officer – IT Commodities/Solutions (CIO-CS) means we can deliver the best price, accuracy and ease of doing business, from hardware and security, to labor/services.

The National Institutes of Health awarded CAS Severn the CIO-CS (Chief Information Officer – IT Commodities/Solutions) contract in the spring of 2015. This contract allows us to sell to all departments within the federal government. It replaced the ECS-III contract, which we held for 14 years.

CIO-CS Contract holders like CAS Severn have gone through a comprehensive review process prior to award, which includes dimensions such as technical capabilities, past performance, price and cost. Contract holders are the “best of the best,” and that pre-screening allows federal clients to purchase with confidence, knowing that all contract holders have met security standards directed by the federal government.

CAS Severn knows that dealing with the federal government is different from other industries. Here is what sets us apart:

* Our broad portfolio, client references, certifications and technical resources, contract vehicles, and Project Management Office means we can meet criteria for the most stringent RFPs.
* Our location makes us an ideal provider for federal agencies. Centrally located in Laurel, MD with a full shop of skills, we can be onsite quickly and easily in a five-state area, without needing to schedule and fly in technical teams.
* Strong partnerships in the federal government ecosystem of providers, technology partners and technology distributors enhances the CAS Severn value for government.

### A HISTORY OF SUCCESS WITH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT SOLUTIONS

We’ve worked for more than 15 years with the Department of Justice, 12 years with the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, and more than 20 years with other healthcare agencies.
