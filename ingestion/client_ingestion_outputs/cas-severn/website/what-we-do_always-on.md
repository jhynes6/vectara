#### Cloud-integrated Data Management, Governance & Security

# Always On

In the multi-cloud world, we have seen the majority of our clients move to active-active data centers with cloud integrated disaster recovery and data protection. The outcome? An always-on business capable of withstanding operational issues and outages as well as larger-scale issues.

**We help you define and deliver:**

* Multi-site active-active data centers and fault tolerance.
* Cloud-integrated data protection and data recovery.
* Archive and data compliance solutions for SaaS and IaaS, as well as on-premise workloads.
* Data security, compliance, and encryption.

### Multi-Site Active-Active Data Center Architectures

We have delivered multi-data center availability for more than 20 years. We can help you determine what recovery point and recovery time objectives make the most sense for your applications, and balance cost with a new level of availability you may not have thought was possible.

As the cost of infrastructure has dropped and more simplistic active-active designs have come to market, we have delivered these designs for customers of all sizes, in as quickly as a month.

We design these solutions based on your preferred technologies, and work with all the major suppliers and technologies, such as Dell EMC, HPE, IBM, Infinidat, Nutanix, VMware, and more.

### Cloud-Integrated Data Protection

We help our clients with three use cases for cloud integrated data protection:

* Archive less relevant data to the cloud, eliminating tape or expensive deduplication appliances with inexpensive cloud storage.
* Provide a DR copy out of region in the cloud for recovery of regional issues or disasters.
* Backing up IaaS and certain PaaS workloads from AWS, Azure, Google and IBM.

We work with the best technologies to enable these use cases, including but not limited to:

* IBM and Infinidat for our large enterprise users, and users of next gen workloads like Big Data and HPC.
* Rubrik for a simplified next-gen approach to data protection.
* VEEAM for simplified and inexpensive enterprise data protection.
* Additional partners include HYCU, Cohesity, Nexsan, HPE and Dell EMC.

### Office 365 & SaaS Data Protection

**Rubrik:** Recovery M365 data faster via Rubrik Prioritized Recovery, empowering you to recover critical business data in 1% – 5% of the time of a mass recovery. Get your M365, SharePoint, Teams and Active Directory, and Intra operational again with minutes or hours, not days or weeks.

**Cohesity:** Recover your CRM (SalesForce, Zendesk, Hubspot), ERP (SAP, Workday, NetSuite) and eCommerce (Shopify, Magento, Wix) back to business with minimal operation. With a broad ecosystem of SaaS recovery capabilities, Cohesity delivers enterprise SaaS app resiliency.

**Veeam:** Veeam Data Platform offers complementary 365 and Salesforce business data recovery, in line with your Shared Responsibility Model. Data loss due to ransomware is not an option!

### Data Security for Sensitive Data

While many of the above solutions enable fault tolerance and operational recoveries for issues like Malware attacks, we also provide best-in-class solutions for identifying critical data (such as personally identifiable information or PII) across your database and unstructured/file data sets, encrypting this data and securing the access to this data. More information on this subject can be provided by speaking to our Cybersecurity team.

We work regularly with comprehensive solutions in this space, including IBM Guardium, StealthBits, and Dell Security.
