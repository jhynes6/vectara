# CAS is the Leader in Mid-Atlantic SLED

## Rapidly expanding across the East Coast

With over 100 years of combined experience, our team helps you stay ahead of what’s new and what’s next. Our State and Local focus is built on “Contracts + Capabilities”—because while competitors often offer one or the other, CAS delivers both. We bring unmatched access to local and state agency-focused cooperatives, along with deep expertise in modern data centers, hybrid cloud, data resiliency, and cybersecurity.

This powerful combination has made us the #1 provider in Maryland and Virginia for data center, backup and recovery, and zero trust solutions in large State and Local institutions—and the fastest-growing State and Local IT partner in Delaware, Washington, DC, and North Carolina.

## State and Local Government

### SPECIAL PRICING AND GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS

We possess a number of contracts with inter-governmental clauses that allow other government entities to utilize that pricing. For example, the contracts we have with Prince George’s County Board of Education would work in other education environments because of their participation in Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (MWCOG).

We are honored to say we serve more than 50 satisfied state and local government clients in the Mid-Atlantic area, many of whom we have worked with on multiple occasions.

To see how we have helped some of our State and Local Government clients, visit our case studies.
