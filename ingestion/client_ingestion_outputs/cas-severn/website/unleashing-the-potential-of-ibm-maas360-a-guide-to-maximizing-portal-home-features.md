# Unleashing the Potential of IBM MaaS360: A Guide to Maximizing Portal Home Features

by CAS Severn | Sep 9, 2024

## Enhancing Visibility, Control, and Security

For IT professionals managing a growing number of devices, IBM MaaS360 provides an efficient and reliable solution to secure and manage everything from smartphones to tablets. With the latest updates to MaaS360’s Portal Home, IBM has significantly enhanced visibility, control, and streamlined workflows for IT leaders, CISOs, and CIOs. Let’s explore what makes the new Portal Home so effective and how you can maximize its features to boost operational efficiency and security in your organization.

### Centralized Dashboard for Enhanced Efficiency

The updated Portal Home has been redesigned for efficiency and ease of use. For decision-makers like CISOs and IT Directors, managing information across thousands of devices can be overwhelming. The new Portal Home addresses this by providing a centralized dashboard that brings everything to the forefront—real-time analytics, alert notifications, and actionable insights—making it easier to assess the health of the entire device ecosystem at a glance.

The dashboard offers enhanced filtering options and custom views, allowing users to prioritize what matters most. For example, you can create widgets for critical alerts or device health metrics, tailoring the dashboard to your organization’s specific needs. By customizing the interface, IT leaders can concentrate on the most pressing security and compliance issues, ensuring quick and targeted responses. This flexibility helps reduce time spent navigating the interface and ensures IT teams stay focused on key priorities.

Furthermore, the centralized dashboard serves as a hub for all important metrics, enabling cross-team collaboration. IT departments can share critical data with other departments, such as compliance or executive teams, to ensure everyone is aligned on the organization’s security posture. The dashboard’s user-friendly design and customizable features make it a powerful tool for collaboration and decision-making, ultimately driving better business outcomes.

## Remote Device Management—Quick and Flexible

The upgraded Portal Home also improves remote device management capabilities, which is crucial for IT teams overseeing a hybrid or remote workforce. The intuitive navigation makes it easier to access device actions—such as remote lock, wipe, or messaging—from one central location. By reducing the number of steps needed and simplifying workflows, IT admins can respond more quickly to emerging threats or incidents, enhancing the organization’s overall security posture.

With the hybrid work model becoming the norm, the ability to manage devices remotely is critical to maintaining control over a dispersed workforce. The Portal Home’s enhanced capabilities allow IT teams to take swift action when devices are compromised or when urgent updates are needed. This flexibility helps ensure that all devices are always up to date with the latest security patches, minimizing vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

Administrators can also leverage automated workflows to handle routine tasks, such as onboarding new devices or updating policies. Automation not only reduces the workload for IT teams but also ensures consistency across all devices, allowing IT leaders to focus more on strategic initiatives rather than everyday operations. By automating repetitive tasks, organizations can significantly reduce the chances of human error, which is often a leading cause of security breaches.

The Portal Home also allows for scheduled device actions, such as nightly updates or routine maintenance checks. This scheduling capability further enhances efficiency, allowing IT admins to plan ahead and ensure that maintenance does not interfere with regular business operations. These improvements give IT teams greater control over the timing of updates and actions, minimizing disruptions while maximizing productivity.

IBM MaaS360’s Portal Home revolutionizes device management with real-time analytics, enhanced workflows, and customizable dashboards—empowering IT leaders to boost operational efficiency and security across their organizations.

## Actionable Insights for Better Decision-Making

The updated Portal Home emphasizes actionable insights. Enhanced analytics allow IT leaders to visualize trends, compliance status, and potential risks clearly and effectively. This information is critical for CISOs and top-level directors who need to make proactive, informed decisions to mitigate risks. By leveraging these insights, organizations can strengthen their security strategies and ensure all devices remain compliant with internal and regulatory standards.

The insights provided by the Portal Home are not just limited to device health but also include user behavior patterns. Understanding how users interact with their devices can help IT leaders identify unusual activities that might indicate a potential security threat. For example, if a user suddenly accesses sensitive information outside of their usual work hours, this behavior can be flagged for further investigation. These types of insights allow organizations to take a more proactive approach to security, addressing potential issues before they become major problems.  
MaaS360’s integration capabilities with platforms like Azure and other identity providers also enable a unified approach to device and identity management. This means IT leaders can seamlessly manage both devices and users, reducing complexity and allowing for faster, more efficient access control. The ability to integrate with identity providers also enhances security by ensuring that only authorized users have access to critical resources, further protecting the organization from threats.

### Empowering IT Teams for Success

The new Portal Home features are designed not just to provide information but to empower IT teams to take meaningful action. From customizable widgets that highlight critical alerts to automated workflows that free up time for strategic planning, IBM MaaS360’s enhanced Portal Home is a valuable tool for enterprises looking to improve their security posture and operational efficiency.

The enhanced customization options empower IT teams to create dashboards that reflect their unique responsibilities and needs. For example, a security-focused admin can set up widgets that display threat alerts and compliance violations, while an operations-focused admin might prioritize device health metrics and deployment statuses. This level of customization ensures that every team member has the information they need at their fingertips, enhancing productivity and effectiveness.

In an ever-evolving threat landscape, the ability to stay agile and informed is crucial. By fully utilizing the capabilities of the new Portal Home, IT leaders can ensure that their device management processes are not only efficient but also proactive—helping keep their organization secure while supporting innovation and growth. The ability to anticipate and quickly respond to threats allows organizations to minimize downtime and maintain business continuity, even in the face of emerging challenges.

Ultimately, IBM MaaS360’s updated Portal Home is about more than just technology—it’s about empowering IT leaders to make smarter, faster decisions that protect their organizations and enable growth. The tools and insights provided by the Portal Home allow enterprises to stay ahead of potential risks, streamline operations, and ensure that their teams are always ready to face the next challenge.
