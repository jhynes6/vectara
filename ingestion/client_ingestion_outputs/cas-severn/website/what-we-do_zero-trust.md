## Simplifying Adoption of the NIST Zero Trust Framework

#### “Never Trust, Always Verify”

* We deliver all 7 tenets of Zero Trust, with a specific focus on:
    * Zero Trust Access (via ZTNA & SSE) – via Zscaler, Netskope, Palo Alto, and Island.io
    * Application Isolation via Illumio, VMware, Nutanix, and Zscaler toolsets
    * Authentication, SSO, and MFA with Microsoft and Okta solutions
* We provide complimentary Zero Trust Guided Workshops that offer a multi-year roadmap for complete adoption, no matter your current maturity level.

### COMPLIMENTARY CYBER LIABILITY INSURANCE REVIEWS

Did you know that if you fill out the documentation for your annual insurance review improperly, if you have a breach your liability insurance may be void? Conversely, if you don’t document the appropriate protections, your rates will be unaffordable, or worse you won’t qualify for coverage at all. Complying with the ever-changing Cyber Liability Insurance requirements from the worlds largest carriers like AIG, Chubb, and Tokio Marine is a real challenge. We have helped numerous clients review and prepare for the annual cyber liability requirements, and developed a complimentary insurance review and prep consultation.

We offer this service directly as well as thru Hyperscaler (AWS, etc.) marketplaces for simple procurement. In special circumstances, we can provide this service at no charge.
