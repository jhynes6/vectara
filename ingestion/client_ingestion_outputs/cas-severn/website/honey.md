You’ve landed “the honey pot” at cassevern.com/honey because you picked up a jar of our wildflower honey—a sweet token from the symposium, courtesy of CAS Severn’s senior leadership.

This isn’t just any honey; it’s a taste of North Carolina’s finest, and it’s the perfect introduction to who we are: an authentic, tenured technology partner dedicated to helping your organization thrive.

Let’s dive into the story behind the honey and explore how CAS Severn can empower you to achieve greatness.

## A Local Treasure from Cary, NC

Our wildflower honey hails from the **Garden Supply Company**, a gem of a business right here in Cary, North Carolina.

When it comes to honey, buying local offers something extra special: a flavor profile shaped by the wildflowers, fields, and forests of our region.

This jar isn’t just a treat—it’s a celebration of North Carolina’s natural bounty, crafted by bees that pollinate the very landscapes we call home.

## HONEY: Nature’s Golden Elixir  
Backed by Science

Honey is more than a sweetener—it’s a marvel of nature with benefits proven by science and cherished for centuries.

*   **Antibacterial Powerhouse**: Honey’s natural properties help fight bacteria, making it a go-to for soothing sore throats and supporting wellness.
*   **Wound-Healing Wonder**: Research shows honey can speed up healing by reducing inflammation and promoting tissue repair—nature’s own first aid kit.
*   **Energy on Demand**: Packed with natural sugars and antioxidants, honey delivers a quick, lasting boost to keep you sharp and focused.

Much like honey nourishes the body, CAS Severn’s technology solutions strengthen your organization, delivering resilience, efficiency, and innovation when you need it most.

## Dosage to Get the Mostest

This golden treat, harvested straight from the hives of bees buzzing among wildflowers, is as versatile as it is delicious. For a simple approach, try **1–2 teaspoons daily**—perfect for savoring its rich, floral taste and tapping into its potential perks, like soothing a scratchy throat or adding a boost of natural energy.

You can scoop it right from the jar, spread it on toast, or swirl it into a lukewarm smoothie (keep it below **104°F** to preserve its raw goodness). Some folks even mix it with a splash of apple cider vinegar for a morning tonic. How much you take really depends on what feels right for you—whether it’s a drizzle here or a dollop there—so play around with it and make it your own!

_Note: heat kills the great stuff for you – so don’t put it in tea or anything super hot if you want the benefits this liquid gold can provide._
