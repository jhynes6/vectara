#### Expertise and Trust for Government Departments Since 2015

The National Institutes of Health awarded CAS Severn the CIO-CS (Chief Information Officer – IT Commodities/Solutions) contract in the spring of 2015. This contract allows us to sell to all departments within the federal government.

CIO-CS Contract Holders like CAS Severn have gone through a comprehensive review process prior to award, which includes dimensions such as technical capabilities, past performance, price and cost. Contract holders are the “best of the best,” and that pre-screening allows federal customers to purchase with confidence, knowing that all contract holders have met security standards directed by the federal government.

### CAS Severn discusses Hyper-converged Infrastructure on the NITAAC Solutions showcase

Hyper-converged infrastructure is seeing rapid growth in the federal government, boasting a 26.6 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the past five years. In fact, it is the fastest-growing sector of the software-defined storage market.

According to Ed McCosby, CAS Severn Senior Solutions Architect, “This is a great platform to do a private cloud on site because you can scale it up and down.”

### NITACC Solutions Showcase: CAS Severn and HPE Simplivity
