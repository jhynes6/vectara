#### Designing AI & ML Platforms is DIFFERENT

# Advanced Computing & Data Management

Our experience in High-Performance Computing (HPC) and building complete data pipelines puts us in a different class than most. We design container-based AI and HPC environments for some of the largest and most security-focused labs in the world. We specialize in the complementary data platforms – whether you require a multi-site data fabric, extreme performance that legacy parallel file systems cannot deliver, or extreme resilience and security requirements.

CAS Severn has decades of history with Lustre and GPFS and has a core competency with next-generation parallel file systems from HPE Ezmeral, HammerSpace, VAST, IBM, VDURA, and Weka.

## Proven Expertise in AI-Ready Storage

With the adoption of AI, the requirements on data architecture and storage have fundamentally changed. We have designed, deployed, tested, and ATO’d some of the most complex storage systems supporting world-class research projects for decades. Whether you work with classic IBM and open-source solutions or seek clarity on how next-generation parallel file systems can benefit your AI and HPC objectives, we have unmatched past performance and technical expertise to help clarify a path forward.

### AI Has Changed The Marketplace

*   **GPU Architecture**: AI design workshops via partnerships with our top infrastructure partners (IBM, HPE, and Dell), with a spotlight on NVIDIA and AMD.
*   **HPE Ezmeral**: Ezmeral Data Fabric (EDF) is the foundation for the entire HPE AI and Ezmeral portfolio. CAS has supported the MapR File System in numerous deployments in high-profile global research organizations, enabling global Data Fabrics for next-generation HPC, research, and AI use cases.
*   **Weka**: Weka delivers a high-performance, cloud-native data platform that accelerates AI workloads by providing a scalable, parallel file system optimized for GPU-intensive tasks and seamless hybrid cloud integration.
*   **IBM Spectrum Scale**: IBM Spectrum Scale offers a mature parallel file system with content-aware capabilities and high-performance storage, designed to support AI and HPC workloads with scalability and efficient data access across on-premises and cloud environments.
*   **Hammerspace**: Hammerspace Anvil delivers a global data environment that unifies disparate storage silos into a single namespace, enabling AI workflows with high-speed access and flexible data orchestration across hybrid and multi-cloud infrastructures, developed by leaders in the Linux foundation that code the NFS protocol itself.
*   **VDURA**: VDURA delivers an AI-optimized storage solution with a focus on extreme performance and durability, leveraging advanced data management and a mature file system in an easy-to-deploy package.
*   **VAST**: VAST provides an all-flash, unified data platform that accelerates AI and deep learning workloads by combining scalable storage, database, and compute services, optimized for GPU-intensive tasks across on-premises, cloud, and edge environments.
