## About Blueprint

Blueprint brings transparency to the home-selling process, allowing home-owners to get rapid, no fuss quotes to sell their home quickly.

## THE CHALLENGE

### Growing awareness through digital

The home-buying market in Georgia is incredibly competitive, so Blueprint needed a way to stand out from their competition.

Most of the companies in this space have old, clunky websites that are difficult to navigate and understand.

We sought to differentiate Blueprint by creating a website that felt fresh and modern, with content that was easy to navigate and understand.

## THE Outcome

### Blueprint began receiving its first inbound leads within less than a month of launching, giving its sales team a new channel for deal sourcing, and providing its customers with a much-needed modernized experience.
