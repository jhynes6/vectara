## About Clutch
Clutch is the industry-leading retention marketing platform for retail. They're transforming the way B2C companies identify, understand and motivate their customers.

## Solution
### Building an inbound engine
Dodeka partnered with Clutch to build a modern website and multi-channel marketing campaign that would help them reach new prospects and increase inbound deals, while ensuring tight alignment between sales and marketing.

## Website
### Leveling up their web presence
Clutch's product had evolved in recent years and they needed a new way to convey their enhancements and new offerings.

We worked closely with the marketing team to reimagine how their web presence. Working from the ground-up we overhauled the site map and content structures with an enhanced User Experience (UX) and improved Search Engine Optimization (SEO) as the primary goals.

With custom motion graphics and interactive elements we put the Clutch platform in the spotlight, giving prospects a glimpse into the technology they have access to with Clutch.

## Ads And Landing Pages
Ads are only as effective as they are engaging. That's why we spent months running over 20 a/b tests to find the winning combo of language and visuals for each of their unique audiences, helping drive over a **60:1 Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)**. But we're not satisfied, which is why we continue to run new tests every month, making sure we're keeping up with shifting consumer preferences.
