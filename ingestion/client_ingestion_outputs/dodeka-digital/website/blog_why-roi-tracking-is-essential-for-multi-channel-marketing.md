# Why ROI Tracking is Essential for Multi-Channel Marketing

Understanding marketing ROI in today's digital landscape presents a unique challenge for many businesses. With the increasing complexity of customer journeys and multiple marketing channels, measuring true return on investment has become more nuanced than ever before.

Through our experience partnering with venture-backed startups and private equity firms, we've discovered something interesting: while most businesses track basic marketing metrics, **_many struggle to connect their marketing efforts to actual revenue outcomes._** The challenge isn't just collecting data—it's understanding how different marketing channels work together to drive results.

They’re spreading budgets across dozens of channels without truly understanding what’s working and what’s burning cash. Even worse, many are _celebrating_ vanity metrics while their competitors are quietly capturing market share.

## The Multi-Channel Marketing Campaigns Problem

Here’s the reality: According to Google’s Zero Moment of Truth study, your customers interact with your brand anywhere from [20-500 times before making a purchase](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/consumer-journey/the-zero-moment-of-truth-macro-study/). Think about that for a moment. **Every email, social post, ad, or piece of content is just one small piece of a much larger puzzle.** And if you’re not tracking how these pieces fit together in your marketing ROI story, you’re essentially throwing darts in the dark.

The numbers tell a clear story. McKinsey research shows that [73% of customers use multiple channels](https://hbr.org/2017/01/a-study-of-46000-shoppers-shows-that-omnichannel-retailing-works) during their shopping journey. Meanwhile, Gartner reports that marketing teams are spreading their budgets across an average of 12 different channels, yet [71% of marketers](https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing) lack confidence in their ability to measure cross-channel campaign effectiveness (according to data in 2023), ultimately leading to a lack of knowledge on their marketing ROI.

The challenge is clear: while marketing teams are investing in multiple marketing channels, they’re struggling to understand how these channels work together. To effectively track marketing ROI, it is essential to understand the performance of each channel and how they contribute to the overall marketing strategy. Campaign metrics might look good in isolation - high email open rates, strong social engagement, solid ad click-throughs - but conversion rates and customer acquisition costs often tell a different story. Sound familiar?

## The Revenue-Driving Truth

Recent industry studies show that successful e-commerce purchases typically [involve 20-50 different marketing touchpoints](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/consumer-journey/the-zero-moment-of-truth-macro-study/). Even more importantly, customers who engage with multiple types of content before purchase tend to have 40% higher average order values.

Look at Glossier, a beauty and skincare brand. They recognized that their customers who engaged with their blog, Into the Gloss, [were 40% more likely](https://digiday.com/marketing/glossier-uses-data-make-content-commerce-work/) to make a purchase vs. customers who only visited the Glossier site or stores.

Understanding how much revenue is generated from each customer interaction allows businesses to optimize their marketing strategies and improve overall ROI.

This isn’t just about tracking numbers - it’s about understanding the real customer journey and optimizing for revenue.

Companies that implement comprehensive marketing ROI tracking see:

*   23% improvement in marketing efficiency
*   32% higher marketing ROI than their peers
*   58% better understanding of their customer journey
*   27% better returns on their marketing investments

But here’s what really matters: these companies are building sustainable competitive advantages while their competitors chase trends and headlines.

## Stop Making These Costly Mistakes in Your Marketing Campaign

Here’s where most companies go wrong - they look at each channel in isolation without considering the overall marketing cost. But modern customers don’t think in channels. According to [Salesforce’s State of the Connected Customer report](https://www.salesforce.com/resources/research-reports/state-of-the-connected-customer/), 76% of customers expect consistent interactions across departments, yet 54% say it generally feels like sales, service, and marketing don’t share information.

By understanding marketing costs, businesses can better allocate their budgets and improve the efficiency of their marketing campaigns.

Research from the CMO Council shows that businesses with integrated multi-channel strategies achieve [91% higher year-over-year customer retention rates](https://www.cmocouncil.org/thought-leadership/reports/critical-channels-of-choice) compared to organizations without. Despite this, only 39% of companies have processes in place to track customers across channels.

This disconnect costs businesses real money. [Harvard Business Review’s research](https://hbr.org/2013/09/the-truth-about-customer-experience) revealed that customers who used multiple channels spent an average of 4% more in-store and 10% more online than single-channel customers.

## The Path to Real Results in Marketing Strategy

Want to stop guessing and start growing? Here’s how to build a revenue-driving tracking system that actually works:

To measure marketing ROI effectively, businesses need to implement systematic strategies that account for various marketing touchpoints and metrics.

### Start Small, Think Big

1.  Begin with 3-5 key metrics aligned with your business goals
2.  Build up to more sophisticated ROI tracking over time (maybe start with tracking social media ROI, like what Hootsuite recommends [here](https://blog.hootsuite.com/measure-social-media-roi-business/))
3.  Focus on metrics that directly impact revenue
4.  [Review and adjust your tracking methods](https://www.avo.app/blog/our-definitive-guide-to-tracking-plans) quarterly
5.  Train your team to think of your marketing efforts in terms of customer journeys, not channel metrics

### Choose the Right Tools

1.  Build a foundation with Google Analytics 4 or Adobe Analytics
2.  Integrate Google Ads (or other ad platforms) with your analytics to track and analyze campaign performance alongside other marketing channels.
3.  Integrate your marketing, analytics, and CRM platforms
4.  Consider a Customer Data Platform for unified tracking ([like Breather did](https://segment.com/customers/breather/) when it started to use Twilio Segment)
5.  Implement [heat mapping](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/weaverellard_the-cobblers-children-have-no-shoes-activity-7242153996424028161-ryf6?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) and user behavior analytics ([we love Microsoft Clarity](https://clarity.microsoft.com/projects))
6.  Set up [custom dashboards](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/weaverellard_all-this-data-literally-tells-me-nothing-activity-7229134652161097728-wmWS?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) that compile all these channels in one place, so you can cut the noise and just see the metrics that matter most

### Protect Privacy, Preserve Data

1.  Emphasize first-party data collection
2.  Build transparent data practices
3.  Turn privacy compliance into a competitive advantage
4.  Implement consent management systems
5.  Create value exchanges that make data sharing worthwhile for customers

## Transform Data Into Revenue

The real power of comprehensive tracking of your marketing efforts isn’t just in the numbers - it’s in what you do with them. These insights not only help in predicting customer behavior but also contribute to significant profit and revenue growth. Calculating marketing ROI helps businesses understand the financial impact of their marketing efforts and make data-driven decisions to drive revenue growth. Leading companies are using their tracking insights to:

*   Predict customer behavior patterns before they emerge
*   Identify high-value customer segments early in the journey
*   Optimize campaign timing based on customer engagement patterns
*   Personalize content and offers at scale
*   Allocate budgets more effectively across channels

The results? Companies using advanced attribution models are 32% more likely to exceed their revenue goals and 23% more likely to outperform their competitors in customer retention.

## The Future of Measuring Marketing ROI

The marketing landscape continues to evolve rapidly. AI and machine learning are transforming how we track and attribute marketing success in our marketing campaigns, moving us beyond simple last-click attribution to understanding the complex web of touchpoints that drive conversion. Cross-device tracking is becoming more sophisticated, while real-time optimization is becoming the standard.

Privacy-first tracking solutions are emerging as traditional cookies phase out. Smart companies are already building first-party data strategies and implementing new measurement frameworks that respect user privacy while maintaining marketing effectiveness across their marketing efforts.

**But here's what won't change: the need to understand and optimize your marketing ROI across all channels.**

The companies that master their marketing ROI will thrive. Those that don't will continue to waste money on ineffective campaigns with low marketing ROI while wondering why their competitors keep winning.

## Ready to Drive Real Revenue?

Tired of guessing whether your marketing is working? Here's our secret formula to how we would go about building a revenue-driving tracking system that helps you understand & optimize your marketing ROI:

First, **Understand Which Channels Truly Impact Your Bottom Line**

*   Map your current customer journey across all marketing touchpoints
*   Identify which channel combinations appear to drive the highest conversion rates (therefore likely driving the highest ROI)
*   Combine this with your spend data to try to calculate your true customer acquisition cost across channels

Next up, **Optimize Your Marketing Spend for Maximum Impact**

Armed with the data above, try to:

*   Eliminate wasteful spending on underperforming channels (high CaC and low ROI? Probably time to cut it)
*   Invest more in your highest-performing channel combinations until you find the point of diminishing returns
*   Scale successful campaigns with confidence

Then, **Optimize Your Campaigns Utilizing the Data You're Now Armed With**

*   Continue to review and adjust your campaigns based on the _actual customer behavior_ you're now tracking (we suggest bi-weekly reviews)
*   Target your highest-value prospects more effectively
*   Optimize messaging across every stage of the customer journey (bonus points if you can share these messaging wins with sales so they can utilize them too)

Fourth, **Build Sustainable Competitive Advantages**

If you do the previous steps successfully, you'll be able to have real advantages against your competition, like the ability to:

*   Gain deeper insights into your customer behavior
*   Stay ahead of market trends with real-time data, through tracking ROI
*   Make faster, more informed marketing decisions

Finally, **Scale Your Marketing Efforts Efficiently**

*   Replicate successful campaigns across channels
*   Maintain effectiveness while growing your reach
*   Improve marketing ROI as you increase marketing spend

The cost of flying blind in today's complex marketing landscape is too high. Don't let another quarter go by without knowing exactly how your marketing drives revenue. Your competitors are already figuring this out—isn't it time you did too?
