# A photographer who captures genuine, organic moments

Carly Smoltz Photography is about being your authentic self. Carly helps businesses, families, couples, and professionals create and capture their unique moments and personalities.

## How We Helped

We helped Carly brand her business and develop a site to showcase her awesome work. Focusing on her blend of spontaneity and pre-planned shots, we created a brand that gives content room to breathe and lets the excellent imagery speak for itself.

## The Goal

### Let The Story Shine

Carly wanted users to not just see her photography, but understand the stories behind each shoot. With this in mind, we crafted each category and project page to blend content and imagery for a more complete story.

Using the [**Webflow**](http://webflow.com/) platform, we developed Carly's site with unique animations to engage users and draw them into the stories Carly helps tell so well.

## The Outcome

Carly's site has become a place she can not only display her work, but also drive clients to action through custom form integrations and CTAs. And with Webflow's unique Content Management, she will be able to add projects and categories quickly so her site can grow with as her business does.
