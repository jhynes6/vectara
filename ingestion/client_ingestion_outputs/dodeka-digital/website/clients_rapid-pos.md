## ABOUT RAPID

RapidPOS is one of the nations leaders in Retail and specialty store point of sale software and hardware. They've been in service for 20+ years, continuing to provide modern solutions for retailers to delight their customers.

## THE OPPORTUNITY

While focusing on keeping their product modern and cutting edge, Rapid's website had quickly become static and outdated, with only one page to represent all of their expertise. We built a modern, robust site and updated their brand to fit their new digital presence.

By learning from their team of experts, we understood their unique perspective on the the industry, and were enabled to write, design, and launch over 40 new pages, showcasing the breadth and depth of their expertise. Potential customers are now finding Rapid, and experiencing a site that's truly representative of what they're capable of.

## THE CHALLENGE

### Marrying content and design

RapidPOS needed a brand new site that was modern, responsive, and far more in-depth than their current one page site. They also needed to modernize their brand and simplify their language, so that they could clearly reach and communicate with their dream customers.

Utilizing the [**Wordpress**](http://wordpress.com/) platform, we launched a robust, adaptable and modern experience that's allowing them to drive organic site traffic, so that new customers can easily find, engage, and partner with Rapid.

## THE Outcome

### Within a few months, we were able to create 40+ pages from scratch, allowing Rapid POS to have a site as robust, modern, and intuitive as their product.
