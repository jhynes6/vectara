Campaign Criteria

Targeting

Describe your top three target personas (clients): 
 (ex: We sell to small business owners in the services industry with more than 10 employees) 
 (ex: We sell to marketing decision makers at ecommerce businesses with more than 5 employees) 
 (ex: We sell to founders of technology-enabled companies) 
 We sell to marketing decision makers at companies with over 100 employees. Common job titles are: VP of Marketing, Director of Marketing, Chief Marketing Officer, Senior Marketing Manager. 
 We sell to to field marketing and event marketing professionals at companies with at least 50 employees, OR event planning companies (example of one of our clients linked here)
 We sell to various departments of higher ed including student / campus life, admissions, alumni, etc. 
 **Please note we have found it easier to get through to companies in the 100-1,0000 employee size, versus Enterprise. Obviously, we are always open to a lead from an Enterprise sized company, but find that the process to work with them is much more cumbersome and involves contract negotiations, procurement departments and RFPs which we don’t love. 
 Are there industries you won’t sell to? 
 (ex. Health Care, Law Firms, Franchises)
 No

Offerings

What services do you sell to your top 3 target personas? (ex. PPC, Social Content, Email Marketing) 
 (ex: Email marketing to small business owners in the service industry)
 (ex: TikTok UGC to Marketing Decision makers at e-commerce businesses)
 (ex: PPC to founders of technology-enabled companies) 
 For this group, we like to be their ‘one stop shop’ for all branded needs. This includes internal items such as branded apparel for employees, employee gifts, sales meetings & all-company events, new hire giveaways, philanthropy days, etc. Externally, we supply items they give away at trade shows & career fairs, backdrops & tablecloths, customer gifts, branded items to send to prospective clients, leave behind gifts for the sales team. 
 For this group, we are coming up with creative items that can showcase their brand either at an activation or large scale event. We supply barware, plates, cups, napkins, tablecloths, giveaways, swag store, uniforms and banners/backdrops. 
 For this group, we do a lot of apparel (t-shirts to give to students) and on-trend, youthful items. This group is budget conscious and often looks for the lower price point, high volume giveaway options. We offer creative services to design the t-shirts, bags, etc in the case that the higher ed department does not have the time or ability on staff. 
 For each service, what are your top offers (packages/examples) that you would be willing to pitch them?
 (ex: Guaranteed 30% more email revenue in 90 days for SMB owners)
 (ex: First 5 UGC videos for free for DTC E-Commerce Brands)
 (ex: 30 Days Free Ad Management)

Cost of Services

What is your average order value? What are your “Starting At” costs for your services?
 (ex: Email Marketing: campaign strategy, design, development, automation, personalization, and analytics. Pricing is everything from one-off projects at $10-$50k to yearly agreements up to $1MM/year)
 (ex: 1000 Tik Tok Impressions/month + Content Creation= $5000 order value)
 (ex: tier 1: $2500 CPC Budget + $500 Service Fee, tier 3: $12,500 CPC Budget + $2500 Service Fee)
 We sell thousands of products and costs can vary order by order and client by client. Costs are dependent on a number of factors, including quantity being ordered, artwork going on the item, and style of item. Our website serves as a catalog for browsing and general estimates, but we quote everything on an individual basis via email. 
 Our average sale size is around ~$3500 per sale but this varies a TON based on the type of client. We are high volume, versus selling one-time contracts. On average in any given week, we could be doing between $50,000 - $100k plus in orders. 

Service Differentiation

What makes you different from your competitors? What is your “special sauce”?
 (ex: We implement 8 proprietary flows to maximally engage customers via email. 14 touch-points across a 30 day visit to our customers site has been proven to concert the highest % of site visits to paying and repeat customers)
 This sounds cliche - but our overall customer experience sets us apart from the majority of our industry. Clients always have the same dedicated reps (either an individual rep, or a rep team) that they are working with throughout the entire order and are never passed off to a new department. They receive same day responses and we pride ourselves on our overall level of communication throughout an order. We are able to get quotes and responses back to requests within the same day or next day 99% of the time and customers are notified at each key step of the overall order process. 
 Additionally, we act as an extension of their team by sending new products, trends and proactive quotes that align with their marketing objective / industry. We have graphic design and creative services that are included free of charge the majority of the time as long as they accompany an order. We love to brainstorm and come up with ideas to pitch based on event details like budget, qty & audience. In return, this saves our customers time by not having to sift through websites and catalogs with no understanding of item quality / specs. 
 I like to use the line “We work with companies who care about things like brand standards, quality and standing out from everyone else.” 

Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? What do you do to improve their business?
 (ex: My clothing line has stopped reaching new buyers and we want to break into a new niche. Facebook keeps getting more expensive and makes it hard to target new buyers.
 Solution: Organic UGC content is the perfect mechanism to branch out to new customers. We help you find influencers who are exactly like your target audience, work with them to create videos and then use those videos to penetrate your new niche audience.)
  1. “My vendor is fine, but I often experience slow responses to my emails, small errors in how my logo is printed, and a general laziness when it comes to finding new items. I feel like they are just an order taker, when in reality I would like to be notified of new and different things and partner with someone who values my brand as much as I do.”
 Solution - we have bi-annual planning sessions to discuss key marketing priorities, upcoming events, and budgets so that we can mark our calendars and begin work on these projects at least 60-90 days out. We obtain client’s brand guidelines whenever they are available and adhere to brand standards as a part of our standard process. We also partner with the leading industry suppliers to stay current on trends and new products ahead of each season. 
 2. “My process for swag is not standardized. I go to various websites to get ideas and look for products, spend time sorting through all of the options and then after I order what I want it’s always a gamble on whether it will show up on time and look right.” 
 Solution - think of us as concierges. Our customers have dedicated reps that they always have access to via phone, email or text. We work with our clients to take the heavy lift of product sourcing off of their plate by showing them curated offerings based on their budget and event details. We own the artwork details and show virtual proofs to review & approve before any items go into production. We have graphic designers on staff that control PMS colors, designs and any other relevant artwork details so that the final product matches exactly what the customer is looking for. 

Case Studies and Previous Customer Successes

For each service, what are case studies or recent customer successes that you use to highlight your expertise in your field?
 (ex: generated 50k in net new sales in 30 days for a service business with a seasonal email marketing campaign)
 (ex: generated 120k in net new revenue with a GenZ-focused organic TikTok Campaign) 
 (ex: increased CTR by 240% and sign ups by 318% with Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo Campaign)
 Notable clients: 
 Splenda - Food/Bev
 Reduced item cost by 60% for client A by changing suppliers, and strategically buying in larger volume in order to take advantage of larger price breaks. This item is one of their ‘core’ brand items they give out so it resulted in significant saves for them YoY. 
 Recent large scale events that we have been the primary vendor partner for:
 Medallia Experience linked here - footage of swag store about halfway through.
 Scale Computing Platform 2025 linked here - we operated an on-site swag store at the event which sold company branded merchandise to over 1,000 attendees.
