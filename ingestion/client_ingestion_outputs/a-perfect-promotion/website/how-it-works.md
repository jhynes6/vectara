# FAQ’s

*   How long will it take to receive my order?
    
    Generally, most hard goods & apparel orders take 2-3 weeks, including proof approval & shipping. There are rare occasions/items that require a longer lead time, but we are quick to call that out! Unless otherwise noted, a 2-3 week timeline can be expected.
    
*   What's the minimum amount I can order?
    
    This depends on the item. For hard goods, the minimums tend to be higher, such as minimums of 50, 100, etc. We are always willing to search for an item with a lower minimum, but there occasions where we can't source a few items at a time. Regarding apparel, we can do minimums of 12 for screen print and as low as 1 for embroidery!
    
*   Do you offer design services?
    
    We offer a range of professional design services tailored to meet your unique needs. Whether you're starting from scratch or refreshing an existing brand, our design team of can assist you at every stage of the process. Our design team will develop initial concepts based on your input, refining them until they perfectly align with your needs. Pricing varies depending on the complexity of the design service.
    
*   What format does my logo/artwork need to be?
    
    Your artwork or logo should ideally be in the following formats: . ai, .eps, .svg, .pdf  
    Your artwork needs to be in vector format, which is best for scalability. These formats are resolution-independent, meaning they can be resized to any dimension without losing quality, making your artwork crisp and clean.
    
*   Can anyone do an online store?
    
    Yes! There is a $1,500 minimum that each store must meet, but anyone and everyone can set up a store with us.
    
*   What does the timeline look like for online stores?
    
    It takes us between 1-2 weeks to get a store up and running depending on the complexity and size of the store. We then leave it open for 1-2 weeks to make sure people have enough time to order, but not too much time that they keep putting it off and miss the deadline. After the store closes, it takes us 3-4 weeks to process the orders, decorate the items, sort and package the orders, and drop off/ship the orders.
    
*   Why should I do an online store?
    
    Online stores are a stress-free way to easily organize orders for a large (or even small!) group of people with minimal hassle and effort on your part. We find options for you, set up the store, handle the processing, backend, and can even handle payment from those ordering.
    
*   What shipping options are available for online stores?
    
    There are two shipping options that you can choose for your store. One is the “Pick Up at _____” where you choose a central location (normally a company’s headquarters) for people to pick up their orders. This option is free, and all orders come packaged and labeled, ready to distribute. The other is a “Ship to Home” option. This has a flat rate shipping fee of $10.00-$12.00 (depending on the scope of the store) per order and will allow us to ship the order to the home of the one ordering.
