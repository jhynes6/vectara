#### Meet THE OWNERS

CLAYTON AND TRISHA MONFRE

A Perfect Promotion began in Morton, Illinois in 1968. Entrepreneurs at heart, Clayton and Trisha Monfre saw an opportunity to develop a creative business focused on building relationships with their clients and acquired the company in 2011.

Since then, they’ve expanded their team and have opened an office in Indiana to widen APP’s scope. Currently, there are 12 employees…all of whom see the vision Clayton and Trish have cast for this company and want to not only be along for the ride but also play a part in its success and the success of its clients.
