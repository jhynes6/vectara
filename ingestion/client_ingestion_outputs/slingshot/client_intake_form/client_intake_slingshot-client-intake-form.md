Campaign Criteria

Targeting

Describe your top three target personas (clients): 
 We sell to Product-based Businesses, that rely on or need innovation/new products:
 We sell to business units that are capable of funding a single $200K - $300K development program, once every 2-3 years.
 We sell to business units that are capable of funding multiple smaller projects (< $50K) every year
 We sell to business units that are capable of funding a single $1MM+ program once every 5-10 years, and this program may span 2-5 years.
 Industry/Sector Agnostic
 Geography Agnostic (most of our clients are in the southeast and midwest regions)
 Are there industries you won’t sell to? 
 Service-based Businesses, such as Law Firms, Accounting Firms, etc.
 We try and steer clear of Accelerators, Incubators, and Universities

Offerings

What services do you sell to your top 3 target personas? (ex. PPC, Social Content, Email Marketing)

As a product design and development company, we offer comprehensive, customized research, design, engineering, prototyping, testing and commercialization solutions. These services allow companies to create and sell New Products, Devices, Apps, Software, etc.

 We have been in business for over 20 years, and in that time have developed over 1000 products and created over 750 global patent documents for our clients. There are numerous examples of commercialized products, with multi-million dollar revenues, we have developed for our clients. We value our client’s successes, and work hard to ensure the products we create for them are successful in growing their businesses.

Service Differentiation

What makes you different from your competitors? What is your “special sauce”?
 Our special sauce is the inclusion of Science & Technology at the fore-front of all of our work.
 Project Management is critical to our success, as many of our competitors make the mistake of relying on each engineer/designer to manage their own projects and typically those types of people don’t do well in this area, causing project failure and client relationship failure.
 Additionally, we utilize highly skilled experts in a very wide range of fields, rather than interns or junior professionals.
 Nigel & I have spent a lot of time handpicking and training our people to work in this field. The people that we surround ourselves with are multi-faceted and passionate about the work they do.
 Our fixed-fee model is also unique to the business, as the majority of our competitors charge by the hour.

Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? 
 Examples of Client Intro. Conversations:
 “Nigel, I want to identify new products and new markets for our company to expand”
 “As I was thinking more about some potential projects, it occurred to me we are close to kicking off an updated version of a controller we currently sell. When I look at the proposed concepts, I’m not excited about it. This might be a good fast turn opportunity to consider.” 
 “My name is George S. and I believe your team has connected with our team in the past. We have a design challenge at this time and I wanted to get some insight to your company on how we can potentially proceed with a design improvement on a production product. I would like to know what information will be requested from us and what output you can provide as a solution. Additionally, examples of a similar case you have faced in the past with improvement on a running production part will be helpful in our decision.”

Cost of Services

What is your average order value? What are your “Starting At” costs for your services?
 Our average program value is $110K, with a range from $10K to $1MM.
 Our average “phase of work” within a program is <$50K
 Projects/Phases of Work breakdown (from 2016 through 2023):
 < $50K is 75% of our business …. These would be R&D programs that did not continue into engineering and commercialization
 $50K - $100K is 8% of our business
 > $100K is 17% of our business …. These are R&D programs that DID continue into engineering and commercialization
 “Starting At” costs are typically $10 - 20K for looking at patentability and technology/idea viability. This would be considered “Phase 0”. A Phase 1, consists of a full brainstorm and down-selection to a single concept. Phase 1 typically costs $30K - $50K. This is really the smallest we can go. There is not much we can do, for say, $5K.
 HOWEVER - there is a new service that we are just starting to offer (not yet advertised for) in which we believe we can take a client’s existing CAD and create Photorealistic Marketing Renderings for about $5K, so a client could use these to sell an idea internally to management, or for pre-sales, etc. externally.


Preferred Method of Communication

Mode of contact (Phone/Email/Text)
 | Email preferred. Nigel is easily reached by phone, Taylor less so. Text message is a good option if you don’t hear from us by email.

In the case where either contacts are on vacation, how can we reach out with updates or questions about the campaign?

This will never happen. But texting would be the fastest method.
