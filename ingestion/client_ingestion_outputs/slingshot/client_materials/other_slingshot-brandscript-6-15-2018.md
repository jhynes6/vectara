3 MEETS A GUIDE: AUTHORITY

How we can prove ourselves with success stories.

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

Choose 3 case study success stories that demonstrate how we deal with "the villain" problems.

Testimonials: Bomax and other client testimonials (A+ Corp, Fed. Mogul?) dributts, bomax, black and decker?, baosheng

lee

Awards: masterack-leggit and platt-IDSA, kamando joe-best of show

Success Stories: Craftsman, Black & Decker, Tide products, Arm & Hammer products (a year or two in market), Irrimax

IP: Arm & Hammer, NAR, Guardian Glass, Truper, Oatey, Lonza, all filed IP we generated for them.

Top clients include: Black & Decker, Coca-Cola, Arm & Hammer (Church & Dwight), Playtex, Merck

•

Merial Select -- large company, but are they recognizable?, P&G, Hu-Friedy, Irrimax, Guardian Glass, Federal

Mogul, CDC, Osprey (need to ask them first), Henny Penny, Xerox* (need to ask), GA Pacific, PaperWorks

Logos of clients needs to be refined

•

Print Out and cross out bad ones

Ways we help:

1.

Case Studies & Awards - 18 years / 1800 products - with evidence of adjacent work & client references.

•

over 18 years we have successfully developed more than 1800 products for client companies including

many Fortune 500 companies. We can handle everything from concept to product manufacture and

supply chain logistics.

2.

3.

4.

A New Product Development Process - that works every time (new?, how old is our model)

Low Cost - Inherent in the externally sourced fee-for-service model

An aggressive timeline - that is faster than any conventional internal company process can achieve.
