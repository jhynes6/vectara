As such, EMF waveforms and current orthopedic clinical use of EMF waveforms comprise relatively low frequency components and are of a very low power, inducing maximum electrical fields in a millivolts per centimeter (mV/cm) range at frequencies under five KHz. A linear physicochemical approach employing an electrochemical model of cell membranes to predict a range of EMF waveform patterns for which bioeffects might be expected is based upon an assumption that cell membranes, and specifically ion binding at structures in or on cell membranes, are a likely EMF target. Therefore, it is necessary to determine a range of waveform parameters for which an induced electric field could couple electrochemically at a cellular surface, such as by employing voltage-dependent kinetics.

Subsequently, PRF therapeutic applications have been reported for the reduction of post-traumatic and post-operative pain and edema in soft tissues, wound healing, burn treatment, and nerve regeneration. The application of PRF for resolution of traumatic and chronic edema has become increasingly used in recent years. Results to date using PRF in animal and clinical studies suggest that edema may be measurably reduced from such electromagnetic stimulus\_x000D\_\n[0051]The within inventions may be based upon biophysical and animal studies that attribute effectiveness of cell-to-cell communication on tissue structures' sensitivity to induced voltages and associated currents. A mathematical power comparison analysis using at least one of a Signal to Noise Ratio (“SNR”) and a Power Signal to Noise Ratio (“Power SNR”) evaluates whether EMF signals applied to target pathway structures such as cells, tissues, organs, and molecules, are detectable above thermal noise present at an ion binding location. Prior art of EMF dosimetry did not take into account dielectric properties of tissue structures, rather the prior art utilized properties of isolated cells. By utilizing dielectric properties, reactive coupling of electromagnetic waveforms configured by optimizing SNR and Power SNR mathematical values evaluated at a target pathway structure can enhance wellness of the respiratory system as well as repair of various respiratory injuries and diseases in human and animal cells, organs, tissues and molecules for example sarcoidosis, granulomatous pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, and “World Trade Center Cough.” Cell, organ, tissue, and molecule repair enhancement results from increased blood flow and anti-inflammatory effects, and modulation of angiogenesis and neovascularization as well as from other enhanced bioeffective processes such as growth factor and cytokine release.\_x000D\_\n[0052]As mentioned above, broad spectral density bursts of electromagnetic waveforms having a frequency in the range of one hertz (Hz) to one hundred megahertz (MHz), with 1 to 100,000 pulses per burst, and with a burst-repetition rate of 0.01 to 10,000 Hertz (Hz), are selectively applied to human and animal cells, organs, tissues and molecules.

| 525 | US7048543B2 | Substantially solid bleaching composition in a tray-like configuration | Dental bleaching compositions are in the shape of a dental tray or tray-like configuration, optionally in combination with a protective barrier layer. Shaped bleaching compositions comprise a substantially solid dental bleaching composition that has increased adhesiveness to teeth when moistened with saliva or water. The shape of the dental bleaching composition facilitates placement of the composition over a person's teeth with substantially less manipulation compared to the use of initially flat bleaching strips. The substantially solid dental bleaching composition becomes more adhesive when moistened with saliva or water, yet remains intact and coherent after the dental bleaching composition is placed over a person's teeth during bleaching, particularly when used in combination with a moisture-resistant barrier. The result is that the moistened dental bleaching composition is able to reliably adhere against a user's teeth during a bleaching procedure. | ULTRADENT PRODUCTS, INC. | Company | 505 WEST 10200 SOUTH, 84095, SOUTH JORDAN, UTAH | 2024-08-03 | 2024 | 2003-05-27 | [0002]The present invention is in the field of dental bleaching devices used to bleach a person's teeth. More particularly, the invention relates to a substantially solid dental bleaching composition in the shape of a dental tray or tray-like configuration.\_x000D\_\n[0003]2. The Relevant Technology\_x000D\_\n[0004]Virtually all people desire white or whiter teeth. To achieve this goal, people either have veneers placed over their teeth or have their teeth chemically bleached. In the past, patients who desired to have their teeth bleached had to submit to conventional in-office bleaching techniques. The process generally involves: (1) making an alginate impression of the patient's teeth; (2) making a stone cast or model of the impression; (3) vacuum forming a dental tray from the model, usually from a heated sheet of thin ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA) material, and (4) trimming to exclude gingival coverage. This method results in a tray that is soft and flexible, that is customized to very accurately fit over the patient's teeth, and that is therefore very comfortable to wear. However, the process for making a customized tray is time consuming, often taking days or weeks before the customized tray is available to the patient, and the resulting tray can be expensive.\_x000D\_\n[0005]Because of the time and cost associated with customized trays, less time consuming and costly alternatives have been developed. Contrary to marketing campaigns, however, many alternatives have substantial disadvantages, primarily in terms of their effectiveness (or ineffectiveness) in actually bleaching teeth. They also have their own unique issues relating to ease of use, comfort and poor taste (bleaching compositions are, after all, placed directly into a person's mouth).\_x000D\_\n[0006]One alternative to customized dental trays are non-customized trays that approximate the shapes and sizes of a variety of users' dental arches. While non-customized dental trays can be used without the need for a professional customization procedure by a dentist, such trays tend to be more bulky and less comfortable than custom-fitted trays. Dental Trays that can be self-customized (e.g., so-called “boil and bite” trays) are somewhat more comfortable and better-fitting compared to non-custom trays but less comfortable than trays that are customized by a dentist.\_x000D\_\n[0007]Another alternative tooth bleaching method involves painting a bleaching composition directly onto the surfaces of a person's teeth to be bleached. An advantage of this procedure is that it eliminates the need to obtain a customized tray, or even a non-custom tray. The main disadvantage, however, is that the bleaching composition remains directly exposed to the person's saliva and disruptive forces and movements normally found within a person's mouth. The result is that a significant portion of the bleaching composition does not remain on the tooth where bleaching is desired. Instead, some or all of the composition can dissolve away into the person's saliva and/or be transferred to adjacent oral tissues. Because paint-on dental bleaching compositions, like all dental bleaching compositions, contain peroxide-based bleaching agents, irritation to soft oral tissues within the user's mouth and throat is a potential problem when using such compositions.\_x000D\_\n[0008]Yet another alternative tooth bleaching method involves placing a flexible bleaching strip over a user's tooth surfaces. Bleaching strips typically comprise a flexible plastic strip coated with a moist dental bleaching gel on the side of the strip facing the user's teeth. To install the bleaching strip, a portion of the bleaching strip is first placed over the front surfaces of the user's teeth, followed by folding the remainder of the strip around the occlusal edges of the teeth and back against a portion of the lingual surfaces. Like paint-on bleaching compositions, this procedure does not require the user to obtain a customized tray, or even a non-custom tray, into which a bleaching composition must be placed by the user prior to use. An advantage of bleaching strips over paint-on bleaching compositions is that bleaching strips include a barrier that, at least in theory, protects the dental bleaching gel from diffusing into the user's mouth.\_x000D\_\n[0009]In reality, however, because of the generally poor adhesion of bleaching strips to the user's teeth, coupled with their generally flimsy nature, it is often difficult for the user to maintain the bleaching strips in their proper position. Bleaching strips are prone to slip off the teeth through even minimal movement of the user's mouth, jaw or tongue. Indeed, it is recommended that the user not eat, drink, smoke or sleep while wearing the bleaching strip. In practice, it is difficult to talk while maintaining the bleaching strips properly oriented over the teeth to be bleached.\_x000D\_\n[0010]Even if a user successfully maintains the bleaching strip in its proper position during the entire bleaching event, the flowable bleaching gel can diffuse into the person's saliva, potentially causing a poor taste in the user's mouth and possibly discomfort to soft oral and throat tissues. The tendency of the bleaching gel to diffuse into the user's mouth can be accelerated through even minimal shifts of the bleaching strip over the user's teeth, with each shift potentially exposing a new portion of the bleaching gel that remains adhered to the newly exposed surface of the user's teeth. In some cases, the bleaching strip can become so dislodged or mangled that it must be removed by the user and replaced with a fresh bleaching strip to complete the recommended bleaching time. This multiplies the cost and hassle of the bleaching strip method.\_x000D\_\n[0011]In practical terms, the use of bleaching strips can greatly inhibit even the simplest of activities that involve movement of the user's mouth or tongue, such as talking, smiling, making other facial expressions, or even swallowing (which normally occurs subconsciously throughout the day). Indeed, the time when a person's mouth and tongue are prone to move the least is at night while the person is sleeping. Unfortunately, it is recommended that bleaching strips not be used while sleeping, presumably to prevent accidental choking on an inadvertently dislodged bleaching strip. This only confirms the tendency of such bleaching strips to easily dislodge from a user's teeth.\_x000D\_\n[0012]Ultimately, the main impediment to successful bleaching is the failure of users to complete the prescribed bleaching regimen. If the bleaching apparatus is difficult to use, requires numerous repetitions to achieve observable results, or is simply uncomfortable or a hassle to wear, the user may simply give up and abort the bleaching process altogether. Thus, even if significant dental bleaching is possible using a particular bleaching product, it is less likely to occur where the inadequacies of the bleaching apparatus or method causes users to become discouraged before desired results are attained.\_x000D\_\n[0013]In view of the foregoing, there is an ongoing need for improved bleaching apparatus and methods that are simple and easy to use, that more reliably remain in position over the user's teeth, and that result in less diffusion of bleaching composition into a user's oral cavity. Such improvements would be expected to improve or encourage compliance by the user.\_x000D\_\n | 58000 | 18 | 2006-05-23 | 1.

The signals are stored in the modem and uploaded to a central monitoring station. Automatic alerts may be sent from the central monitoring station to a supervising agency. The supervising agency may also access the information through secured dedicated websites via the Internet. | ALCOHOL MONITORING SYSTEMS, LLC | Company | 9135 S. RIDGELINE BLVD. #190, 80129, HIGHLANDS RANCH, COLORADO | 2024-12-05 | 2024 | 2003-05-19 | [0002]This invention relates to a blood alcohol monitoring system, and more particularly, relates to an improved non-invasive method and apparatus for transdermal monitoring of blood alcohol levels.\_x000D\_\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\_x000D\_\n[0003]Reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 5,220,919 titled “BLOOD ALCOHOL MONITOR” and European Patent No. EPO 623001B1 titled “BLOOD ALCOHOL MONITOR”, both owned by the assignee of this invention and both are hereby incorporated herein by reference.\_x000D\_\n[0004]Individuals on probation, parole, or in alcohol treatment programs may be prohibited from consuming alcohol, and many federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies require testing to ensure participants in court ordered programs remain alcohol free. In general, present-generation remote alcohol monitoring devices used in probation, parole, and treatment settings are fixed-location breath-testing devices that utilize voice or video identification of the participant. If a subject tests positive for alcohol, the monitoring device then sends a message alerting the monitoring center of a violation by the subject, and the monitoring center then sends an alert message to the subject's supervising agency or dedicated administrator.\_x000D\_\n[0005]As alcohol is ingested orally, it is absorbed into the body's blood and distributed throughout the body via the circulatory system. Alcohol is eliminated from the body by two mechanisms: metabolism and excretion. Metabolism accounts for the removal of greater than 90% of the alcohol consumed, removing it from the body via oxidation of the ethyl alcohol molecule to carbon dioxide and water primarily in the liver. The remaining alcohol is excreted unchanged wherever water is removed from the body—breath, urine, perspiration, and saliva. Although excretion accounts for less than 10% of the eliminated alcohol, it is significant because unaltered alcohol excretion permits an accurate measurement of alcohol concentration in the body by way of both breath analysis and insensible skin perspiration. Insensible skin perspiration is the vapor that escapes through the skin through sweating. The average person will emit approximately one liter of insensible skin perspiration each day. This perspiration can be used to obtain a transdermal measurement of blood alcohol concentration, referred to as Transdermal Alcohol Concentration (“TAC”).\_x000D\_\n[0006]Transdermal monitoring of blood alcohol levels is accomplished by taking percentage measurements of alcohol contained in the air vapor that is expelled through human skin. A monitoring device is attached to the skin to capture the air and measure the alcohol. There are numerous advantages to transdermal monitoring, as opposed to breath alcohol testing, including, but not limited to, the ability to take readings at any time without the knowledge of the subject, consistent and continuous testing (unlike breath alcohol testing where a subject breathing incorrectly into the testing device can cause inaccurate results), and the ability to convert such readings into electrical signals that can be transmitted to a central monitoring station.\_x000D\_\n[0007]However, there is a continuing need for a remote alcohol monitoring system which can be conveniently placed on the subject that can carry out TAC measurements at selected time intervals as well as at random times. There is also a need for a remote alcohol monitoring system that will compensate for the effects of temperature changes on TAC readings, is tamper-proof, and virtually impossible for the subject to remove without triggering an alarm. Still further, there is also a need to be able to download the TAC measurements to a monitoring station without requiring any actions on the part of the subject being monitored, eliminating the need for the subject to personally report to a central monitoring station or probation officer, or connect the monitoring device to a telephone line to download and transmit data to a monitoring station. The present invention meets these and other needs in the art.\_x000D\_\n | 480000 | 35 | 2008-12-09 | 1.

Tomography relies upon a selected form of energy being directed toward and passing through the object at more than one angle. The energy from the various angles is collected and processed to provide a tomographic image. The received signals are typically less intense (i.e., darker) where the object is thicker or more dense, and more intense (i.e., brighter) where the object is thinner or less dense.\_x000D\_\n[0005]As is known, a signal received by a single energy sensor (i.e., at one angle) does not contain sufficient information to generate either a two-dimensional or a three-dimensional representation of internal structures of the object. As is also known, signals received by energy sensors arranged in a plane or volume provide sufficient information to generate a three-dimensional representation of internal structures of the object.\_x000D\_\n[0006]Tomography is used in a variety of systems with a variety of types of transmitted and received energy. For example, in x-ray Computed Axial Tomography (CAT), x-ray energy is projected through an object, typically at a variety of angles, and a variety of x-ray receivers, at a corresponding variety of angles, are used to receive the x-ray energy. A computer is used to generate an image of internal structures of the object in three dimensions from signals received by the variety of x-ray receivers. It should be recognized that x-rays tend to pass through the object in straight lines with relatively little attenuation.\_x000D\_\n[0007]One type of x-ray CAT system is used for medical imaging and the object through which the x-rays are projected is a person. However, the x-ray CAT system can be used to image internal structures of other objects, for example, luggage at an airport.\_x000D\_\n[0008]Some forms of optical tomography are known, which use one or more wavelengths of visible or invisible light rather than x-rays. However, unlike x-ray tomography, for which x-rays tend to pass through an object in a straight line with relatively little attenuation, light tends to be absorbed and to scatter when passing though an object. Therefore, light does not travel in straight lines when passing through the object. Light also tends to attenuate and to scatter more when passing though a relatively thick object having a relatively non-homogeneous medium, than it tends to attenuate and to scatter when passing through a relatively thin object having a relatively homogeneous medium.\_x000D\_\n[0009]Diffuse Optical Tomography (DOT) and Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT) are known optical imaging techniques that allow optical tomography imaging of internal structure of body parts of animals and humans. DOT is an effective imaging technique capable of imaging hemoglobin concentration and oxygenation. DOT can increase the specificity in detecting disease when used in combination with more established examinations (for example for cancer or arthritis detection and characterization). In addition, DOT is used to study brain activation and to study exercising muscle.\_x000D\_\n[0010]FMT uses fluorochromes, which absorb light propagating inside of an object and emit light at a longer wavelength (lower energy) than the absorbed light inside of the object, allowing non-invasive in-vivo investigation of functional and molecular signatures in whole tissues of animals and humans. FMT enables molecular imaging, i.e., it can probe molecular abnormalities that are the basis of a disease, rather than imaging the end-anatomical effects of the molecular abnormalities as with conventional imaging approaches. Specific imaging of molecular targets provides earlier detection and characterization of a disease, as well as earlier and direct molecular assessment of treatment efficacy. FMT technology can also transfer typical in-vitro fluorescence assays, such as gene-expression profiling, elucidating cellular pathways or sensing small molecule protein interaction to in-vivo non-invasive imaging applications of large tissues.\_x000D\_\n[0011]Some conventional optical tomography systems use near infrared (near-IR or NIR) light, instead of light in the visible spectrum when passing through animal tissues, since NIR tends to attenuate less than visible light. The use of NIR light instead of light in the visible spectrum provides the ability to image deeper tissues, i.e., thicker tissues, or with higher sensitivity than in the visible light region. The development of highly efficient fluorescent probes, i.e., appropriately engineered fluorochromes with high molecular specificity emitting in the NIR, has also enabled FMT imaging of deeper tissues.\_x000D\_\n[0012]Mathematical modeling of light propagation in animal tissue and technological advancements in light sources (photon sources) and light sensors (photon receivers or photo detectors) has made optical tomography possible using diffuse light. Diffuse Optical Tomography (DOT) uses multiple projections and de-convolves the scattering effect of tissue.\_x000D\_\n[0013]Conventional DOT and FMT systems include a light source (such as a diode laser and appropriate driver), and an optical switch, which provides light to a group of optical pathways, for example, optical fibers. The optical switch directs the light source to selected ones of the optical fibers, one at a time, in a sequence. The optical fibers are in direct contact with a diffuse medium to be imaged. Using the optical fibers, the single laser source is directed to selected points on the surface of the diffuse medium. Light is collected with the use of fiber bundles, placed at multiple points, also in direct contact with the surface of the diffuse medium, and the light is directed though the fiber bundles from the diffuse medium to appropriate light sensors. A computer performs tomographic data transformations to provide images for display and storage.\_x000D\_\n[0014]Existing DOT and FMT systems employ light sources and light sensors in direct contact with the object to be imaged, providing direct contact systems. For a description of an exemplary optical tomography system, see D. J. Hawrysz and E. M. Sevick-Muraca, “Developments Toward Diagnostic Breast Cancer Imaging Using Near-Infrared Optical Measurements and Fluorescent Contrast Agents,”Neoplasia, vol. 2, pp. 388-417, 2000.\_x000D\_\n[0015]The contact light sensors each receive light essentially from a single respective point on the surface of the object. Direct contact systems tend to reduce system versatility, limiting the shapes, sizes, and geometries of objects that can be tomograhically imaged with any particular DOT or FMT system. Direct contact systems, when used to image body parts of a patient, also tend to limit patient comfort.\_x000D\_\n[0016]Some optical tomography systems can only be used to image objects having a particular shape. For example, Wake et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,211,512, describes an optical tomography system for use only with objects having a cylindrical geometry.\_x000D\_\n | 700000 | 52 | 2010-01-12 | 1.

| 195 | US8328738B2 | Medical tool for reduced penetration force with feedback means | A medical device for reducing the force necessary to penetrate living being tissue using a variety of reciprocating motion actuators, including piezoelectric, voice coil, solenoids, pneumatics or fluidics. The reciprocating actuator drives a penetrating member, such as a needle, through the tissue at a reduced force while the device detects the passage of the penetrating member through the tissue. Upon passage of the penetrating member through the tissue, electrical power to the reciprocating actuator is automatically terminated. One exemplary method for detecting this passage is via a fluid-containing syringe that is coupled to a channel within the penetrating member. Once the penetrating member tip has passed through the living tissue, the fluid within the syringe no longer experiences any pressure and a plunger within the syringe displaces indicating passage of the penetrating member tip. This motion can provide direct tactile feedback to an operator of the medical device or can automatically open a switch providing electrical power to the medical device. Alternatively, a pressure transducer can also monitor the pressure within the penetrating member channel and automatically activate the switch to cut off the electrical power. | ACTUATED MEDICAL, INC. | Company | 310 ROLLING RIDGE DRIVE, 16823, BELLEFONTE, PENNSYLVANIA | 2028-11-05 | 2028 | 2007-06-29 | [0004]The present invention generally pertains to handheld medical devices, and more specifically to electrically driven lancets; epidural catheter inserters; biopsy medical instruments, such as bone biopsy medical devices; vascular entry penetrating members, spinal access needles and other catheterization needles.

These heating units can be actuated by electrical resistance, by optical ignition or by percussion. Drug supply units and drug delivery articles wherein a solid fuel is configured to heat a substrate to a temperature sufficient to rapidly thermally vaporize a drug disposed thereon are also disclosed. | ALEXZA PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. | Company | 2091 STIERLIN CT., 94043, MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA | 2026-10-23 | 2026 | 2003-05-21 | [0003]This disclosure relates to heating units capable of rapid heating and to articles and methods employing such heating units.\_x000D\_\nINTRODUCTION\_x000D\_\n[0004]Self-contained heat sources are employed in a wide-range of industries, from food industries for heating food and drink, to outdoor recreation industries for providing hand and foot warmers, to medical applications for inhalation devices. Many self-contained heating sources are based on either an exothermic chemical reaction or on ohmic heating. For example, self-heating units that produce heat by an exothermic chemical reaction often have at least two compartments, one for holding a heat-producing composition and one for holding an activating solution. The two compartments are separated by a frangible seal, that when broken allows mixing of the components to initiate an exothermic reaction to generate heat. (see for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,628,304; 4,773,389; 6,289,889). This type of non-combustible, self-heating unit is suitable for heating food, drink, or cold toes and fingers, since the heat production is relatively mild.\_x000D\_\n[0005]Another common source for self-contained heat is ohmic heating. In ohmic heating a current is passed through an electrically resistive material to generate heat that is transmitted to an adjacent article. This mode of heat production has been employed to vaporize or heat a volatile substance, for example tobacco, for inhalation by a user. Cigarette holders and pipe bowls having an electrical resistance coil to generate heat in order to volatilize tobacco flavors have been described (U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,104,266; 4,922,901; 6,095,143). Heating of drugs other than tobacco by ohmic heating have also been described. For example, WO 94/09842 to Rosen describes applying a drug to an electrically resistive surface and heating the surface to vaporize the drug for inhalation. Ohmic heating has the advantage of facilitating precise control of the energy applied to determine the heat generated. However, in many ohmic heating systems, and in particular for small systems where limited energy is available, such as, for example, when using batteries, there can be a substantial delay on the order of seconds or minutes between the time heating is initiated and maximum temperature is achieved. Moreover, for small devices, such as for example, portable medical devices, where the power source comprises a battery, ohmic heating can be expensive and bulky.\_x000D\_\n[0006]Another approach for providing a controlled amount of heat is using electrochemical interactions. Here, components that interact electrochemically after initiation in an exothermic reaction are used to generate heat. Exothermic electrochemical reactions include reactions of a metallic agent and an electrolyte, such as a mixture of magnesium granules and iron particles as the metallic agent, and granular potassium chloride crystals as the electrolyte. In the presence of water, heat is generated by the exothermic hydroxylation of magnesium, where the rate of hydroxylation is accelerated in a controlled manner by the electrochemical interaction between magnesium and iron, which is initiated when the potassium chloride electrolyte dissociates upon contact with the liquid water. Electrochemical interactions have been used in the smoking industry to volatilize tobacco for inhalation (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,285,798; 4,941,483; 5,593,792).\_x000D\_\n[0007]The aforementioned self-heating methods are capable of generating heat sufficient to heat an adjacent article to several hundred degrees Celsius in a period of several minutes. There remains a need in the art for a device capable of rapid heat production, i.e., on the order of seconds and fractions of seconds, capable of heating an article to within a defined temperature range, and which is suitable for use in articles to be used by people.\_x000D\_\n | 890000 | 96 | 2013-03-05 | 1.

| 315 | US7756563B2 | Guidance method based on 3D-2D pose estimation and 3D-CT registration with application to live bronchoscopy | A method provides guidance to the physician during a live bronchoscopy or other endoscopic procedures. The 3D motion of the bronchoscope is estimated using a fast coarse tracking step followed by a fine registration step. The tracking is based on finding a set of corresponding feature points across a plurality of consecutive bronchoscopic video frames, then estimating for the new pose of the bronchoscope. In the preferred embodiment the pose estimation is based on linearization of the rotation matrix. By giving a set of corresponding points across the current bronchoscopic video image, and the CT-based virtual image as an input, the same method can also be used for manual registration. The fine registration step is preferably a gradient-based Gauss-Newton method that maximizes the correlation between the bronchoscopic video image and the CT-based virtual image. The continuous guidance is provided by estimating the 3D motion of the bronchoscope in a loop. Since depth-map information is available, tracking can be done by solving a 3D-2D pose estimation problem. A 3D-2D pose estimation problem is more constrained than a 2D-2D pose estimation problem and does not suffer from the limitations associated with computing an essential matrix. The use of correlation-based cost, instead of mutual information as a registration cost, makes it simpler to use gradient-based methods for registration. | PENN STATE RESEARCH FOUNDATION | Company | 304 OLD MAIN, 16802, UNIVERSITY PARK, PENNSYLVANIA | 2028-07-30 | 2028 | 2005-05-23 | [0003]This invention relates generally to bronchoscopy and, in particular, to a method that provides guidance to the physician during a live bronchoscopy or other applications.\_x000D\_\n | 99000 | 118 | 2010-07-13 | 1.

This process is usually accomplished by using a continuous mechanical force to induce bone remodeling, thereby enabling the teeth to move to a better position. In this approach, orthodontic appliances provide a continuous static force to the teeth via an archwire connected to brackets affixed to each tooth or via a removable appliance such as an aligner, or some similar accessory, that fits over the dentition. As the teeth slowly move due to the force, the force is dissipated. The archwires are adjusted to add additional force and to continue the desired tooth movement. Although effective, this widely accepted approach takes about twenty four months on average to achieve success.\_x000D\_\n[0006]Dental researchers have long postulated that a pulsating force might also be used to move teeth more rapidly and to ease the discomfort of traditional orthodontics.\_x000D\_\n[0007]Mao was probably the first to prove that the use of cyclic forces could improve dental straightening in rabbits (see U.S. Pat. No. 6,684,639, U.S. Pat. No. 6,832,912, U.S. Pat. No. 7,029,276). Certain dynamic loading patterns (cycling force with rest periods) were shown to greatly increase bone formation compared to basic dynamic loading. Inserting rest periods is now known to be especially efficacious as it allows mechanosensitivity to be restored to the bone tissue. A point of diminishing returns is reached within each loading session. Therefore, intermittently loading cyclic force can increase the rate of bone formation significantly.\_x000D\_\n[0008]U.S. Pat. No. 4,244,688, U.S. Pat. No. 4,348,177, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,382,780 describe devices used to vibrate the teeth during orthodontic treatment, although each uses a different means of applying a vibration. The U.S. Pat. No. 4,244,688 employs a cumbersome external power source to power one to four small motors, whereas U.S. Pat. No. 4,348,177 uses pulsating fluids moved with the chewing motion of the jaw, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,382,780 uses a radio and speaker to set up a vibration. These devices are mounted on a bulky headgear that surrounds the head and are connected directly to the teeth by its intraoral portions. The devices are cumbersome, difficult to construct, expensive and are very difficult to use, thus reducing patient compliance.\_x000D\_\n[0009]U.S. Pat. No. 5,030,098 by Branford describes a hand-held device that simulates chewing in order to treat periodontal disease by increasing blood flow to the gums. The mouthpiece has a perforated malleable plate such that biting of the mouthpiece results in the plate adapting to the user's bite which, of course, varies with each user. The external vibrator imparts motion to the mouthpiece and thus the user's teeth. The device, however, uses an external power source and vibrator. Further, the dental plate is brass, and is very unpleasant to bite on, thus necessitating a second exterior coating and further complicating manufacture and cost.\_x000D\_\n[0010]U.S. Pat. No. 5,967,784 by Powers describes a similar device to that described by Branford. It too is a hand-held tooth vibrator that is simple and has an exterior motor housing connected to a vibrating interdental mouthpiece portion for gripping between the teeth of the patient. The exterior housing contains a battery and a switch for selectively operating a motor with an off-center weight attached to the motor rotating shaft for creating a high frequency vibration that vibrates the entire device. The mouthpiece is disposable, making the system affordable and more convenient to use. The patent teaches using the device to alleviate pain by inserting the interdental mouthpiece between the teeth and clenching and releasing the teeth over the mouthpiece, in an attempt to engage as many teeth as possible in the transmitted vibrations. The vibration is believed to alleviate discomfort by increasing blood flow.\_x000D\_\n[0011]The devices of Branford and Powers seem superficially similar to those of the invention herein. However, there is no recognition in either patent that the vibratory device can be used for alveolar bone remodeling or more rapid tooth movement. Furthermore, the shape of the dental plate in each case is a very flat U- or Y-shaped member that is largely ineffective for remodeling dentoalveolar bone. Additionally, the vibration is not optimized in frequency and amplitude for remodeling. Finally, neither device is entirely intraoral, and the extraoral component may cause drooling and inhibit patient compliance. The extraoral component may also lead to inhibition about use of the device in certain settings. All of these shortcomings reduce the effectiveness of these devices for craniofacial remodeling uses.\_x000D\_\n[0012]U.S. Pat. No. 6,632,088 describes a bracket with powered actuator mounted thereto to provide vibration, but this device is cumbersome, and thus may affect patient comfort and ultimately patient acceptance of the device. Further, the device locks to the bracket and archwire, and vibration of the tooth through the bracket is less than optimal, causing wear to the tooth enamel and causing discomfort.\_x000D\_\n[0013]WO2007116654 describes another intraoral vibrating mouthpiece, but the mouthpiece is complex, designed to fit over the teeth and will be expensive to manufacture. Further, to the extent that this device vibrates the brackets, it suffers from the same disadvantages above.\_x000D\_\n | 2880000 | 16 | 2017-05-30 | 1.

They come in a variety of configurations and perform a variety of functions, ranging from medical therapy to erotic stimulation. They typically are battery-powered or run on conventional alternating current electricity.\_x000D\_\n[0004]As noted above, many types of prior art vibrating massagers have been powered by internally contained, disposable batteries. They operate for a period of time on the battery power, subsequently requiring some degree of disassembly, battery replacement and reassembly. It will be apparent to the reader that this type of battery operation has drawbacks, including for example, limited time of operation and the inconvenience and expense associated with the necessary battery replacement.\_x000D\_\n[0005]While some vibrating massagers operate on AC power, for example U.S. 110V or European 220V power, these massagers tend to be large and unsafe for internal use or use in damp environments. They also have the inconvenience of requiring proximity to a wall plug.\_x000D\_\n[0006]In addition to their limitations as to power sources, prior art vibrating massagers are similarly limited in their modes of operation. A typical vibrating massager includes a switch mounted directly on the vibrator housing. Massagers are known which include controls that are connected to the vibrating device by a wire. Control wires, however, are inconvenient in the same manner that electrical wiring to supply power is inconvenient. Further, controls for these wired devices are typically limited to simplistic control functions, such as on/off and intensity functions.\_x000D\_\n[0007]More recently, vibrating massagers have become known that use wireless remote controls to control various functions. As with the wired remote controls, the controlled functions are generally very simplistic. They are unable to transmit or receive complex control signals and are usually incapable of networking with other devices. Many are limited in range and consume excessive power. See, for example relating to wireless vibrators: U.S. Pat. No. 6,028,531 to Wanderlich (a terminal unit for a mobile communications system), U.S. patent application 2005/0075072 to Apitzsch (a remote-control vibrator), U.S. patent application 2003/0195441 to Firouzgar (a remotely controllable stimulator).\_x000D\_\n[0008]Looking more particularly at U.S. patent application 2005/0075072 to Apitzsch, the published application mentions the use of inductive charging for a personal vibrator, however falls short of teaching or suggesting any useful and functional inductive charging structures or functions. The patent further shows the use of Bluetooth™ technology to control the vibrator, teaching relatively limited functionality of the wireless controls.\_x000D\_\n[0009]Another type of controllable vibrator uses audio control signals to affect the operation of the vibrator. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,951,500 to Cutler (a massage system responsive to audio), U.S. Pat. No. 6,027,463 to Moriyasu (a music massager) and U.S. patent application 2002/0065477 (an audio interactive vibrator).\_x000D\_\n[0010]Yet another type of vibrating device can be controlled using external computers, directly and/or through network connections to the Internet. These computer-controlled vibrating massagers are quite complex and require significant infrastructure to operate. See, for example relating to computer-controlled vibrators: U.S. Pat. No. 5,857,986 (an interactive vibrator for multimedia). See, for example relating to network—connected devices, U.S. Pat. No. 5,956,484 to Rosenberg et al. (force feedback over a computer network), U.S. patent application 2005/0027794 to Decker (the remote control of a wireless device using a web browser), U.S. patent application 2004/0132439 to Tyagi et al. (a remotely controllable wireless sexual toy), U.S. Pat. No. 6,368,268 to Sandvick et al. (the control of sexual aids using digital computer networks), and U.S. patent application 2002/0133103 to Williams et al. (an Internet—based electrically—operated sexual aide).\_x000D\_\n[0011]As discussed above, prior art vibrating massagers generally exhibit one or more drawbacks relating to their power source and/or controls. Replaceable batteries are inconvenient while electrical plugs are both inconvenient and inappropriate for smaller devices. Built-in and/or wired controls are generally inconvenient and limited in function. Available wireless controls are limited in function, particularly as relates to interoperability with other devices. Computer and computer network controls, while potentially providing significant functionality, are expensive and complex, and without wireless control, are inconvenient to use.\_x000D\_\n | 710000 | 72 | 2010-07-06 | 1.

The device may additionally include a handle extending from the annular rim at an angle. | CENDROWSKI CORPORATE ADVISORS, LLC | NFC INVESTORS I, LLC | Company | 4111 ANDOVER ROAD, WEST 3RD FLOOR, 48302, BLOOMFIELD HILLS, MICHIGAN | 2028-01-28 | 2028 | 2007-03-28 | [0002]The present disclosure relates generally to a conception device used to concentrate semen and effect fertilization. The present disclosure also generally relates to a method of conception utilizing the device. Furthermore, the present disclosure relates to a conception device that may be implanted by the user in the comfort of her own home and which does not limit normal physical activity while in use.\_x000D\_\nINTRODUCTION\_x000D\_\n[0003]The statements in this section merely provide introductory information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.\_x000D\_\n[0004]Medical devices intended to be inserted into the vagina and secured to the cervix are known for use as contraceptive barriers. One particular contraceptive device, the “cervical cap,” may be placed over the cervix to prevent semen from entering the cervical canal. The cervical cap may be held in place by a suction grip or surface viscosity on the moist cervical surface. Insofar as known devices are intended for the prevention of pregnancy, latex has proven to be a suitable material. Latex, however, may result in semen damage. Thus, a latex device should not be used for delivery of semen.\_x000D\_\n[0005]To a more limited extent, it is known in the pertinent art to provide a cervical device to position a quantity of semen in proximity to the cervix for purposes of facilitating impregnation. In this regard, U.S. Pat. No. 5,857,959 illustrates and describes a conception kit developed by the inventors of the present disclosure. The kit generally includes a conception device comprising a thin, form-assuming, flexible dome, an annular rim, and a pair of gripping flanges along an inner surface of the rim for positioning and securing the device over the cervix. The device concentrates semen on the cervical os to effect fertilization. U.S. Pat. No. 5,857,959 is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. While the conception kit shown and described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,857,959 has proven to be extremely successful in promoting pregnancy, continued improvement in the pertinent art remains desirable.\_x000D\_\n[0006]Some of the primary factors contributing to a decline in fertility include low semen counts, problems with semen motility, tilted cervix, and a hostile vaginal environment due to infection or other chronic conditions. The present disclosure provides an improved conception device and related method for even more effectively concentrating semen for successful fertilization, thereby even better overcoming the various factors associated with fertility decline, including, but not limited to, the aforementioned factors. The conception device of the present disclosure may be made of an implantable material such as a silicone-based material, and may be positioned and secured over the cervix while containing semen to facilitate conception. Moreover, the construction of the conception device allows a woman to increase the likelihood of conception within the comfort, convenience and privacy of her own home, and does not limit normal physical activity.\_x000D\_\n | 61000 | 21 | 2013-06-04 | 1.

| 508 | US7181271B2 | Synergism of photodynamic and electropermeation effect on cell vitality as a novel cytotoxic agent | The present invention is based on the discovery that electroporation of a photosensitive agent in a cell and subsequent activation of the agent provides more effective killing of the electroporated cell than cells exposed to a photosensitive agent alone. The invention provides a method and apparatus for inhibiting cell growth or enhancing cell death. The method includes providing a photosensitive agent to a cell; applying an electric pulse to the cell of a sufficient strength and duration to electroporate the cell with the photosensitive agent; and applying light of an activatable wavelength to the cell thereby activating the agent and inhibiting cell growth or enhancing cell death. | ONCOSEC MEDICAL INCORPORATED | Company | 200 VIRGINIA STREET, 8TH FLOOR, 89501, RENO, NEVADA | 2024-07-01 | 2024 | 2003-10-01 | [0002]The present invention relates generally to electroporation and photosensitization, and more specifically to an apparatus useful for electropermeation of photosensitive agents and methods for inhibiting cell growth or enhancing cell death.\_x000D\_\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\_x000D\_\n[0003]Photoactivation or Photosensitization is a process in which a photosensitive substance activated or excited by energy provided by light or heat forms a highly reactive molecule that transfers its energy (e.g., hydrogen or electron) to other molecules during its return to the unactivated or unexcited state (decay). Transfer of hydrogen or electron to oxygen can form free radical or singlet oxygen, for example, as well as reactive decay intermediates, which subsequently react with or otherwise modify other components. Photooxidizing agents are a particular type of photosensitive agent that forms reactive molecules which oxidize components, and generally function by either of two pathways as shown below: Type (1) activated photooxidizing agent (3D) reacts with oxygen (hydrogen or electron transfer) to produce a positive agent radical and free radical oxygen. The positive agent radical reacts with guanine, for example, and the free radical oxygen can react with other organic components. Type (2) activated photooxidizing agent (3D) transfers energy to oxygen to produce singlet oxygen which subsequently reacts with cell components such as guanine, for example.[0004]Type (1): 3D+02 D++02− D++G D+G+[0005]Type (2): 3D+02 D+102 102+G 02−+G+\_x000D\_\n[0006]Where: D, 3D—dye and its triplet (activated or excited) state; G, G+—guanine as substrate, its radical splits the DNA backbone; and 02, 102, 02−—oxygen, its single state, its radical.\_x000D\_\n[0007]Photosensitive agents have been used for killing cells since the beginning of the century. Photooxidation by natural and synthetic agents has been used experimentally for the destruction of diseased tissue and cancer (Kessel D, Photochem. Photobiol. 44:489 (1986); Bottiroli et al., Photochem. Photobiol. 47:209 (1988); G. Jori and C. Perria (eds), Photodynamic Therapy of tumors and other diseases, Libreria Progetta Editore, Padova, 1985; Berg et al., J. Naturwiss. 53:481 (1966); Koston et al., J. Photochem. Photobiol. B 36:157 (1996); Berg, H., J. Photochem. Photobiol. 28:399 (1988); Kennedy et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,079,262). The photodynamic destruction (photodynamic therapy) of tumors nowadays is one of the more effective methods in cancer therapy (G. Jori and C. Perria (eds), 1985 supra; Koston et al., supra (1996)). Hyperthermia, or heat increases the reaction rate of the photooxidizing agent thereby increasing photodynamic destruction (Kimel et al., J. Laser Surg. Med. 12:432 (1992)). However, systemic administration of photooxidizing agents usually is associated with nonselective cell killing. Furthermore, many agents are relatively insoluble making their in vivo usefulness limited.\_x000D\_\n[0008]The cell membrane may be transiently permeabilized by subjecting cells to a brief, high intensity, electric field. This electrically-induced permeabilization of cell membranes, termed electroporation, has been used by investigators to introduce various compositions such as drugs, DNA, RNA, proteins, liposomes, latex beads, whole virus particles and other macromolecules into living mammalian cells (Berg et al., Electric field effects on biological membranes: electroincorporation and electrofusion In: Bioelectrochemistry II, Membrane Phenomena (Eds. R. G. Milazzo, M. Blank) Plenum Press, N.Y., London, p. 135–1661 (1987); Lehmann et al., Bioelectrochem. Bioenerg. 41:227–229 (1996); Hapala, Crit. Rev. Biotechnol. 17:105 (1997); Eanault et al., Gene 144:205 (1994); Chu et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 15:1311 (1987); Knutson et al., Anal. Biochem. 164:44 (1987); Gibson et al., EMBO J. 6:2457 (1987); Dower et al., Genetic Engineering 12:275 (1990); Mozo et al., Plant Molecular Biology 16:917 (1991)). These studies show that electroporation affords an efficient means to deliver therapeutic compositions such as drugs, genes, polypeptides and the like in vivo by applying an electrical pulse to particular cells, tissues or organs within a subject.\_x000D\_\n[0009]Therapeutic applications of electroporation are now being explored: introduction of functional genes for gene therapy (Nishi et al., Cancer Research 56:1050 (1996)); electroporation of skin for the delivery of drugs into the skin or for the transdermal delivery of drugs across tissue (Zhang et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 220:633(1996)), Weaver et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,019,034 and Prausnitz, Adv. Drug. Deliv. 18:395 (1996)); angioplasty combined with electroporation to deliver drugs to a localized portion of coronary or peripheral arteries has been used to treat restenosis (Shapland et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,498,238); cancer treatment by electroporation in the presence of low doses of chemotherapeutic drugs (Mir, U.S. Pat. No. 5,468,223). Particular apparatus for in vivo electroporation have been developed to effect treatment: Hofmann describes a syringe apparatus for electroporating molecules and macromolecules into tissue regions in vivo in which the needles of the syringe used to deliver the molecules also function as electroporation electrodes (U.S. Pat. No. 5,273,525). Weaver describes an electroporation apparatus for the delivery of chemical agents into tissues in vivo (U.S. Pat. No. 5,389,069). Hofmann et al., describe an electroporation catheter device useful for delivering genes or drugs to treat endothelial and other cells of blood vessels, for example (U.S. Pat. No. 5,507,724). Crandell et al. describe an electroporation catheter apparatus useful for introducing therapeutic macromolecules into endothelial cells of a patients blood vessels (U.S. Pat. No. 5,304,120).\_x000D\_\n[0010]Although numerous efforts have been directed to developing new therapeutic approaches to cancer treatment, cancer continues to be one of the more vexing cell proliferative disorders affecting mankind. Thus, a need exists for the development of new methods and apparatus for treating cancer and other cell proliferative disorders. The present invention satisfies this need and provides related advantages as well.\_x000D\_\n | 69000 | 10 | 2007-02-20 | 1.

| 165 | US8466433B2 | Integrated footwear sanitizing and deodorizing system | Introducing ultraviolet (UV) light to alter the environment inside a shoe or other footwear destroys microorganisms or inhibits their growth. Visible light can also be used to prevent further growth. Introducing forced air flow through the footwear removes dampness in and thereby deodorizes the footwear. A preferred embodiment comprises an adjustable shoe tree equipped with a UV germicidal light source and electronic safeguards that prevent appreciable leakage of UV radiation outside the shoe. | PEDIFIX, INC. | Company | 301 FIELDS LANE, 10509, BREWSTER, NEW YORK | 2027-03-13 | 2027 | 2006-03-13 | [0003]The present disclosure pertains to the use of light and forced air flow in sanitizing and deodorizing human footwear.\_x000D\_\nBACKGROUND INFORMATION\_x000D\_\n[0004]Warm, damp, dark environments provide favorable conditions for growth of infectious biological microorganisms, allowing bacteria, viruses, fungi, and their associated odors to proliferate. For example, foot perspiration within shoes promotes warmth and dampness, while closed shoes stored in dark closets may fail to admit enough broad spectrum ambient light to control pathogen levels. Excessive levels of harmful microorganisms sustained in enclosed shoes may cause or promote various foot maladies.\_x000D\_\n[0005]It is well-known that exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light of certain wavelengths, intensities, and durations can destroy or inhibit growth of surface pathogens. For instance, germicidal lamps that emit UVC radiation are used to treat waste water for the purpose of reducing organic content. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,981,651 and 5,978,996 describe the use of UV light for sterilization; however, not all UV light wavelengths are germicidal. The UV spectrum spans wavelengths from 10 nm to 400 nm. The band from 320 nm to 400 nm is designated as UVA; 280 nm to 320 nm is UVB; and 100 nm to 280 nm is UVC. Germicidal UV light, the type that destroys microorganisms, is limited to a wavelength range from 240 nm to 280 nm, in which maximum germicidal efficiency coincides with a wavelength of 254 nm. UVA and visible light, which includes a near-UV component, have been shown to inhibit growth but not to destroy pathogens.\_x000D\_\n[0006]One concern with harnessing UV light, which is a form of short wavelength, high energy radiation, is that UV light can cause damage to human tissue. Eyes are especially vulnerable when exposed to direct incidence of UV light. Thus, any application of high energy radiation, including UV light, should protect against unwanted exposure.\_x000D\_\n[0007]Many air filtrations systems have filters to clean the air. A typical air filter is the HEPA filter that is designed to remove pollens, dust, smoke and other tiny particles that may attribute to odor. Additionally, some air filtration systems use carbon to help remove pollutants from the air. Other air filters, such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,951,327 and 7,927,554, use titanium dioxide (TiO2), in conjunction with a UV light source, in a process called photo-catalytic oxidation to destroy bacteria, volatile organic compounds, and other airborne pollutants to sanitize the air.\_x000D\_\n | 36000 | 13 | 2013-06-18 | 1.

More specifically, the present invention relates to a fully threaded suture anchor provided with a transverse anchor pin for securing, within the anchor, one or more strands of suture to anchor the suture to bone during arthroscopic surgery.\_x000D\_\n[0003]When soft tissue tears away from bone, reattachment becomes necessary. Various devices, including sutures alone, screws, staples, wedges, and plugs have been used in the prior art to secure soft tissue to bone.\_x000D\_\n[0004]Recently, various types of threaded suture anchors have been developed for this purpose. Some threaded suture anchors are designed to be inserted into a pre-drilled hole. Other suture anchors are self-tapping.\_x000D\_\n[0005]U.S. Pat. No. 4,632,100 discloses a cylindrical threaded suture anchor. The suture anchor of the '100 patent includes a drill bit at a leading end for boring a hole in a bone, followed by a flight of threads spaced from the drill bit for securing the anchor into the hole created by the drill bit.\_x000D\_\n[0006]U.S. Pat. No. 5,370,662 discloses a suture anchor having threads which extend to the tip of the anchor. U.S. Pat. No. 5,156,616 discloses a similar suture anchor having an axial opening for holding a knotted piece of suture.\_x000D\_\n[0007]All of the above-noted suture anchors include structure for attaching the suture to the anchor. U.S. Pat. No. 4,632,100, for example, discloses a press-fitted disc and knot structure which secures the suture to the anchor. In other suture anchors, such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,370,662, the suture is passed through an eyelet located on the proximal end of the anchor. In the case of a bioabsorbable suture anchor, the suture may be insert molded into the anchor, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,964,783.\_x000D\_\n[0008]Problems can arise if the structure for attaching the suture fails, allowing the suture to become detached from the anchor. Also, the suture often is exposed to abrasion or cutting by sharp or rough areas along the walls of the bone canal into which the anchor is inserted.\_x000D\_\n[0009]Moreover, the eyelet or, in the case of U.S. Pat. No. 4,632,100, the axial opening for receiving the disc to which the suture is knotted, is formed as part of the drive head of the known suture anchors. Combining these two functions in one structure often tends to weaken the drive head.\_x000D\_\n[0010]In addition, various other modifications to the drive head often are employed in connection with suture attachment. For example, recessed grooves may be formed on opposite sides of the drive head to receive and protect the suture from abrasive areas of the suture anchor tunnel or to facilitate mating between the anchor to the driver. In such cases, the drive head often must be made of a larger diameter to recover the mechanical strength lost from the removal of material relating to the suture-attachment or suture-protection modifications.\_x000D\_\n[0011]Further, the prior art suture anchors having eyelets extending from the proximal ends require countersinking of the eyelet below the bone surface to avoid having the patient's tissue abrade against the exposed eyelet. As a result, suture attached to the eyelet is vulnerable to abrasion by the bony rim of the countersunk hole into which the suture anchor is installed. In addition, in biodegradable suture anchors, the suture eyelet can degrade rapidly, causing the suture to become detached from the anchor prematurely.\_x000D\_\n[0012]Accordingly, there is a need for a threaded suture anchor to which suture is secured effectively so as to prevent detachment of the suture. It is further desirable for such suture anchors to have eyelets that will not abrade tissue and which do not require countersinking.\_x000D\_\n | 1280000 | 101 | 2013-01-01 | 1.

Peters, published Jan. 9, 2003, for a vascular hole closure device provides the following state of the technology information, “During certain types of vascular surgery, catheters are inserted through an incision in the skin and underlying tissue to access the femoral artery in the patient's leg. The catheter is then inserted through the access opening made in the wall of the femoral artery and guided through the artery to the desired site to perform surgical procedures such as angioplasty or plaque removal. After the surgical procedure is completed and the catheter is removed from the patient, the access hole must be closed. This is quite difficult not only because of the high blood flow from the artery, but also because there are many layers of tissue that must be penetrated to reach the femoral artery.”\_x000D\_\n[0007]United States Patent Application 2002/0133193 published Sep. 19, 2002, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,391,048 issued May 21, 2002, to Richard S. Ginn and W. Martin Belef, for an integrated vascular device with puncture site closure component and sealant and methods of use provides the following state of the technology information, “Catheterization and interventional procedures, such as angioplasty and stenting, generally are performed by inserting a hollow needle through a patient's skin and muscle tissue into the vascular system. A guide wire then is passed through the needle lumen into the patient's blood vessel. The needle is removed and an introducer sheath is advanced over the guide wire into the vessel. A catheter typically is passed through the lumen of the introducer sheath and advanced over the guide wire into position for a medical procedure. The introducer sheath therefore facilitates insertion of various devices into the vessel while minimizing trauma to the vessel wall and minimizing blood loss during a procedure. Upon completion of the medical procedure, the catheter and introducer sheath are removed, leaving a puncture site in the vessel. Commonly, external pressure is applied until clotting and wound sealing occurs. However, this procedure is time consuming and expensive, requiring as much as an hour of a physician's or nurse's time, is uncomfortable for the patient, and requires that the patient be immobilized in the operating room, cathlab, or holding area. Furthermore, a risk of hematoma exists from bleeding prior to hemostasis.”\_x000D\_\n[0008]U.S. Pat. No. 6,174,322 issued Jan. 16, 2001 to Bernhard Schneidt for an Occlusion device for the closure of a physical anomaly such as a vascular aperture or an aperture in a septum provides the following state of the technology information, “The human circulatory system is comprised of a cardiovascular circulation and pulmonary circulation. In the embryonic phase of the development of a human being, the two circulatory systems are joined by the ductus arteriosus. The ductus connects the aorta (systemic circulation) with the pulmonary artery (pulmonary circulation). In the normal development of an infant, this ductus closes after birth. In pathological development, the ductus may not close so that the two circulatory systems remain connected even after birth. This can reduce the life expectancy of the infant. Closure of the ductus by means of a surgical procedure is well-known. However, this procedure is very cost-intensive and is connected with a risk for the patient. Closure of the ductus by means of an IVALON™ (polyvinyl alcohol) foam plug (Porstmann method) is also well-known. In this case, a guide rail is introduced via a femoral vein into the aorta, through the ductus into the pulmonary artery and from there through the right ventricle and the right atrium and finally to the outside again via the opposite femoral vein. The ductus plug is then pushed into the ductus where it is “jammed in place.” Owing to the high pressure differential between the aorta and pulmonary artery, high demands are placed on the fixation of the ductus plug within the ductus.”\_x000D\_\n | 1060000 | 5 | 2015-05-26 | 1.

The treatment device can be used for dental treatments such as bleaching, administration of fluoride, or application of other medicines.\_x000D\_\n[0004]2. The Relevant Technology\_x000D\_\n[0005]Virtually all people desire white or whiter teeth. A common bleaching method involves the use of a dental tray that is custom-fitted to a person's teeth and that is therefore comfortable to wear. One type of customized tray is made from a stone cast of a person's teeth. Another is customized directly using a person's teeth as a template (e.g., “boil-and-bite” trays). Non-customized trays that approximate the shapes and sizes of a variety of users' dental arches have also been used. A dental bleaching composition is placed into the tray and the tray placed over the person's teeth for a desired period of time.\_x000D\_\n[0006]Another tooth bleaching method involves placing a flexible bleaching strip over a user's tooth surfaces. Conventional bleaching strips comprise a flexible plastic strip coated with a dental bleaching gel of moderate viscosity and relatively low stickiness on the side of the strip facing the user's teeth. To install the bleaching strip, a portion of the bleaching strip is placed over the front surfaces of the user's teeth, and the remainder is folded around the occlusal edges of the teeth and against a portion of the lingual surfaces.\_x000D\_\n[0007]Because of the generally poor adhesion of bleaching strips to the user's teeth, coupled with their generally flimsy nature, it is often difficult for the user to maintain the bleaching strip in its proper position for the recommended time. Conventional bleaching strips are prone to slip off the teeth as a result of even minimal movement of the user's mouth, jaw or tongue. It is recommended that the user not eat, drink, smoke or sleep while wearing the bleaching strip. In some cases, the bleaching strip can become so dislodged or mangled that it must be removed by the user and replaced with a fresh bleaching strip to complete the recommended bleaching time.\_x000D\_\n[0008]Ultimately, the main impediment to successful bleaching is the failure of users to complete the prescribed bleaching regimen. If the bleaching apparatus is difficult to install over a person's teeth, requires numerous repetitions to achieve observable results, or is uncomfortable to wear, the user may simply give up and prematurely abort the prescribed bleaching regimen. Thus, even if dental bleaching is possible using a particular bleaching apparatus or method, it is less likely to occur if the inadequacies of the bleaching apparatus or method cause a user to become discouraged before desired results are attained.\_x000D\_\n[0009]In view of the foregoing, there is an ongoing need for improved bleaching apparatus and methods that are simple and easy to use and that reliably remain in position over the user's teeth so as to reduce diffusion of bleaching composition into a user's oral cavity. Such improvements would be expected to improve or encourage compliance by the user.\_x000D\_\n | 730000 | 8 | 2013-05-21 | 1. A pre-shaped, non-customized dental tray device suitable for placement over at least a portion of a person's dental arch, the dental tray device comprising:\_x000D\_\na generally horseshoe-shaped moisture resistant barrier layer configured to substantially correspond to the curvature of a person's dental arch and having sufficient flexibility without heating in boiling water so as to readily conform to a plurality of differently sized dental arches corresponding to different people without customization,\_x000D\_\nthe barrier layer having a labial-buccal wall, a lingual wall, and a bottom wall interposed between the labial-buccal wall and the lingual wall,\_x000D\_\nthe barrier layer having an anterior region that at least partially covers anterior teeth surfaces when worn and a posterior region that at least partially covers posterior teeth surfaces when worn,\_x000D\_\nthe barrier layer being substantially devoid of structures corresponding to the size and shape of a person's unique dentition so that the barrier layer is designed to comfortably fit over a plurality of differently-sized and/or shaped teeth corresponding to different people;\_x000D\_\nthe moisture resistant barrier layer comprising one or more structural features that facilitate the ability of the barrier layer to conform to a plurality of differently-sized and/or shaped teeth when worn, the one or more structural features comprising an abrupt reduction in width of the bottom wall at a location corresponding to a transition between the posterior region and the anterior region of the barrier layer to account for a significant difference between the occlusal surface width of posterior teeth as compared to anterior teeth. | A61C19/063 | A63B71/085 | A61C19/066 | 11 | 20 | Gum massage|Teeth filling|Dental tools|Sport apparatus|Teeth capping|Tooth cleaning | Posterior region|Engineering|Anatomical feature|Moisture|Biomedical engineering|Dental treatments|Anterior region|Pointed tooth |

| 168 | US8064669B2 | Fast 3D-2D image registration system with application to continuously guided endoscopy | A novel framework for fast and continuous registration between two imaging modalities is disclosed. The approach makes it possible to completely determine the rigid transformation between multiple sources at real-time or near real-time frame-rates in order to localize the cameras and register the two sources. A disclosed example includes computing or capturing a set of reference images within a known environment, complete with corresponding depth maps and image gradients. The collection of these images and depth maps constitutes the reference source. The second source is a real-time or near-real time source which may include a live video feed. Given one frame from this video feed, and starting from an initial guess of viewpoint, the real-time video frame is warped to the nearest viewing site of the reference source. An image difference is computed between the warped video frame and the reference image. The viewpoint is updated via a Gauss-Newton parameter update and certain of the steps are repeated for each frame until the viewpoint converges or the next video frame becomes available. The final viewpoint gives an estimate of the relative rotation and translation between the camera at that particular video frame and the reference source. The invention has far-reaching applications, particularly in the field of assisted endoscopy, including bronchoscopy and colonoscopy. Other applications include aerial and ground-based navigation. | THE PENN STATE RESEARCH FOUNDATION | Company | 304 OLD MAIN, 16802, UNIVERSITY PARK, PENNSYLVANIA | 2026-05-19 | 2026 | 2005-05-23 | [0003]This invention relates generally to image correlation and, in particular, to a fast image registration method applicable to guided endoscopy and other fields.\_x000D\_\n | 1180000 | 33 | 2011-11-22 | 1.

State of Technology\_x000D\_\n[0005]U.S. Patent Application 2003/0144695 by James F. McGuckin and Richard T. Briganti, published Jul. 31, 2003, and U.S. Patent Application 2003/0009180 by Peter W. J. Hinchliffe, James F. McGuckin, Richard T. Briganti, and Walter H. Peters, published Jan. 9, 2003, for a vascular hole closure device provides the following state of the technology information, “During certain types of vascular surgery, catheters are inserted through an incision in the skin and underlying tissue to access the femoral artery in the patient's leg. The catheter is then inserted through the access opening made in the wall of the femoral artery and guided through the artery to the desired site to perform surgical procedures such as angioplasty or plaque removal. After the surgical procedure is completed and the catheter is removed from the patient, the access hole must be closed. This is quite difficult not only because of the high blood flow from the artery, but also because there are many layers of tissue that must be penetrated to reach the femoral artery.”\_x000D\_\n[0006]U.S. Patent Application 2002/0133193 published Sep. 19, 2002, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,391,048 issued May 21, 2002, to Richard S. Ginn and W. Martin Belef, for an integrated vascular device with puncture site closure component and sealant and methods of use provides the following state of the technology information, “Catheterization and interventional procedures, such as angioplasty and stenting, generally are performed by inserting a hollow needle through a patient's skin and muscle tissue into the vascular system. A guide wire then is passed through the needle lumen into the patient's blood vessel. The needle is removed and an introducer sheath is advanced over the guide wire into the vessel. A catheter typically is passed through the lumen of the introducer sheath and advanced over the guide wire into position for a medical procedure. The introducer sheath therefore facilitates insertion of various devices into the vessel while minimizing trauma to the vessel wall and minimizing blood loss during a procedure. Upon completion of the medical procedure, the catheter and introducer sheath are removed, leaving a puncture site in the vessel. Commonly, external pressure is applied until clotting and wound sealing occurs. However, this procedure is time consuming and expensive, requiring as much as an hour of a physician's or nurse's time, is uncomfortable for the patient, and requires that the patient be immobilized in the operating room, cathlab, or holding area. Furthermore, a risk of hematoma exists from bleeding prior to hemostasis.”\_x000D\_\n[0007]U.S. Pat. No. 6,174,322 issued Jan. 16, 2001 to Bernhard Schneidt for an Occlusion device for the closure of a physical anomaly such as a vascular aperture or an aperture in a septum provides the following state of the technology information, “The human circulatory system is comprised of a cardiovascular circulation and pulmonary circulation. In the embryonic phase of the development of a human being, the two circulatory systems are joined by the ductus arteriosus. The ductus connects the aorta (systemic circulation) with the pulmonary artery (pulmonary circulation). In the normal development of an infant, this ductus closes after birth. In pathological development, the ductus may not close so that the two circulatory systems remain connected even after birth. This can reduce the life expectancy of the infant. Closure of the ductus by means of a surgical procedure is well-known. However, this procedure is very cost-intensive and is connected with a risk for the patient. Closure of the ductus by means of an IVALON® (polyvinyl alcohol) foam plug (Porstmann method) is also well-known. In this case, a guide rail is introduced via a femoral vein into the aorta, through the ductus into the pulmonary artery and from there through the right ventricle and the right atrium and finally to the outside again via the opposite femoral vein. The ductus plug is then pushed into the ductus where it is “jammed in place.” Owing to the high pressure differential between the aorta and pulmonary artery, high demands are placed on the fixation of the ductus plug within the ductus.”\_x000D\_\n | 68000 | 16 | 2014-11-11 | 1.

| 314 | US7889905B2 | Fast 3D-2D image registration method with application to continuously guided endoscopy | A novel framework for fast and continuous registration between two imaging modalities is disclosed. The approach makes it possible to completely determine the rigid transformation between multiple sources at real-time or near real-time frame-rates in order to localize the cameras and register the two sources. A disclosed example includes computing or capturing a set of reference images within a known environment, complete with corresponding depth maps and image gradients. The collection of these images and depth maps constitutes the reference source. The second source is a real-time or near-real time source which may include a live video feed. Given one frame from this video feed, and starting from an initial guess of viewpoint, the real-time video frame is warped to the nearest viewing site of the reference source. An image difference is computed between the warped video frame and the reference image. The viewpoint is updated via a Gauss-Newton parameter update and certain of the steps are repeated for each frame until the viewpoint converges or the next video frame becomes available. The final viewpoint gives an estimate of the relative rotation and translation between the camera at that particular video frame and the reference source.

In one embodiment, a series of RF pulses used to suppress fluid in the bone marrow spaces, particularly in cancellous bone tissue, is combined with solid state projection reconstruction magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to provide a three-dimensional image of a bone in which the dominant signal arises substantially from solid organic bone matrix. | THE GENERAL HOSPITAL CORPORATION | CHILDREN'S MEDICAL CENTER CORPORATION | Company | 55 FRUIT STREET, 02114, BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS | 300 LONGWOOD AVENUE, 02114, BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS | 2026-10-11 | 2026 | 2002-05-17 | [0002]This invention relates generally to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and more particularly to a method and apparatus for measuring the degree of volumetric (3-D) bone organic matrix density.\_x000D\_\nGlossary of Currently Used Terms to Describe the Structure, Composition and Organization of “Bone”\_x000D\_\n[0003]The term “bone” may be used to refer to various levels of bone structure, composition and organization, from the gross visual, naked eye identification of a specific whole bone or a part of a whole bone such as the femur (the upper bone of the thigh), viz., “bone” as an organ or a part of an organ, to the specific structural organization of portions of a bone by light microscopy, that is, of “bone” as a tissue, e.g., compact bone or cancellous (spongy or trabecular) bone, or even to the organization of the individual components of bone tissue, that is, “bone” as a substance or material (bone substance) whose individual components can be visualized, for example, by electron microscopy and other techniques.\_x000D\_\n[0004]FIGS. 1A, 1B and 1C show the cylindrical portion of the diaphysis (shaft) of an animal's tibial bone (portion of a whole gross bone). The bone material or substance is densely packed—thus the cylindrical wall of the bony shaft, the bone tissue, is described as compact bone. At the ends of a long bone, the bone as an organ, for example, the head and neck regions of the femur, the bone substance is not densely packed. Indeed, the bone tissue is clearly organized in a specific three-dimensional, loosely packed interconnected open network consisting of small segments of bone substance referred to as trabeculae, and the bone tissue referred to as cancellous or spongy or trabecular bone tissue.\_x000D\_\n[0005]The basic bone substance or material is composed principally of a soft matrix consisting primarily of the (fibrous) protein collagen and small amounts of other organic constituents and other extracellular, extravascular organic constituents and is referred to as the organic matrix of bone substance. It is into this matrix that the other major component of bone substance, the hard crystals of calcium-phosphate (“apatite”) (solid mineral phase), is deposited. Therefore, the two major components of bone substance are: (1) a soft organic matrix and (2) the hard solid phase of the calcium-phosphate crystals, the solid mineral phase. These two components provide a good portion of the mechanical properties of bone as an organ, a tissue and a material substance, as well as many of the physiological functions of bone substance. The organic matrix of bone substance is ordinarily considered to consist of the extracellular, extravascular organic components of the bone substance and the bone tissue, and is chemically analyzed by measuring the collagen or collagen and other known proteins and organic constituents of the extracellular, extravascular matrix.\_x000D\_\n[0006]The composition of the bone substance can therefore be expressed in terms of the relative proportions of the two major constituents of bone substance, either by the weight percentages of the two major components, viz., the weight percentage of the organic matrix compared with the weight percentage of the solid mineral phase, or better still, by consideration of the volumetric density of the solid mineral phase and, independently, of the volumetric organic matrix density: it is much more important and informative to be able to express the composition of bone substance and of bone tissue in terms of volume, e.g., the mass or weight of the solid mineral phase in a unit volume of bone substance (gm/cm3), and the volumetric density of the mass or weight of the organic matrix in a unit volume of bone substance in gm/cm3. From these data, viz., the volumetric density of the solid calcium-phosphate mineral phase and the volumetric density of the soft organic matrix, it is possible to calculate the extent or degree of mineralization, that is, the extent to which a unit volume of bone substance in compact or cancellous bone tissue is mineralized. This has not been accomplished previously by any noninvasive technique but has been accomplished as described in this patent application. Because this invention accomplishes the measurement of bone organic matrix density by MRI, no ionizing radiation is used, and therefore patients may be examined repeatedly without the risk associated with ionizing radiation.\_x000D\_\n[0007]We therefore use the following terms and definitions: (1) bone mineral density; (2) bone organic matrix density (organic matrix density of bone); (3) extent (or degree) of bone mineralization. It is important to distinguish, however, whether these data have been calculated from 2-D (areal) measurements and not measured as 3-D volumetric data, or have been directly measured as volumetric 3-D data, as accomplished by the techniques described in this patent application. It is from these directly measured volumetric data that it is possible to calculate the volumetric extent or degree of mineralization of bone substance non-invasively. The ratio of volumetric, 3-D bone mineral density to volumetric bone organic matrix density is referred to as the extent or degree of bone mineralization.\_x000D\_\n[0008]Currently, the 3-D volumetric extent or degree of mineralization cannot be measured noninvasively. It can be determined by chemical and gravimetric analyses of a piece of bone tissue removed from a patient or an animal surgically by biopsy. Clearly, such a surgical procedure cannot be carried out each time a measurement is needed to follow the course of any particular disease or to assess the efficacy of a particular drug or treatment over a long, extended period of time.\_x000D\_\n[0009]Techniques for measuring bone mineral density non-invasively have been developed. Two such techniques are by X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Prior to this invention, no noninvasive methods for measuring volumetric bone matrix density had been described.\_x000D\_\n[0010]Currently, two of the most commonly used techniques to measure bone mineral density are: (1) dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and (2) computed tomography (CT). DXA utilizes x-rays of two energies. The mineral and soft tissue each exhibit different x-ray scattering cross sections at each energy level, enabling a map of mineral density to be computed from the scan data. However, because of the variable composition of the soft tissue and its variable depth along the view direction, overlapping bone structure and the inhomogeneity of the 3-D spatial distribution of the trabeculae in cancellous bone, for example, the most commonly analyzed bone tissue using this technique, the 2-D (areal) measurement of bone mineral density may not reflect the true volumetric 3-D bone mineral density. Indeed, serious questions have been raised in the literature about the validity and usefulness of the data obtained by DXA.\_x000D\_\n[0011]Computed tomography (CT) produces an accurate measurement of volumetric, 3-D bone mineral density (grams per cubic centimeter). However, when the x-ray intensity is sufficient to make the CT scan quantitatively accurate (quantitative CT or QCT), the radiation dose to the patient is high, limiting the number of scans permissible for a single patient, thus preventing the use of QCT on women of child bearing age, growing children and patients who may require repeated measurements in order to follow and assess the course of a disease or injury or to assess the efficacy of treatment. Like any x-ray based measurement, CT does not distinguish bone matrix from soft tissue, and is susceptible to errors because of the variability of soft tissue composition and depth.\_x000D\_\nMeasurement of the Volumetric (3-D) Density of the Organic Matrix of Bone by Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging\_x000D\_\n[0012]Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used and highly effective means of producing two and three dimensional images of the body. With suitable settings of the parameters of the pulse sequence (e.g. the definition of the timing, amplitude, frequency, phase and other details of the radio frequency and magnetic field gradient pulses and various control functions produced by the scanner) MRI can yield quantitative data on certain properties of tissues.\_x000D\_\n[0013]Conventional proton MRI detects the fluid proton (hydrogen) content of soft tissues, which is mainly liquid water, and to a lesser extent, fat. However, most solid substances, including bone substance, do not yield signals in conventional MRI, and thus are not detected and therefore not very visible in conventional MRI. Conventional MRI therefore yields no information on the composition of the bone substance To obtain MR images of solid materials, it is necessary to utilize specialized pulse sequences and scanner hardware.\_x000D\_\n[0014]The Larmor (resonance) frequency of a nuclear spin is proportional to a constant (the magnetogyric ratio) specific to each nuclear species, as well as proportional to the total magnetic field in which it is immersed. During MR scanning nuclear spins in a material or body experience both the strong magnetic field of the scanner as well as the smaller local magnetic fields of neighboring nuclear spins. The instantaneous sum of all these fields at the site of a particular spin determines its Larmor frequency. In the most general case of a solid, a particular spin will experience a local field dependent on the number, spatial location and quantum state of all the other spins in its vicinity, in addition to the much stronger field of the scanner. This effect is called dipole-dipole, or spin-spin, coupling. Different spins will experience somewhat different local fields, but all spins will experience the same scanner field. Therefore the Larmor frequencies will be distributed about a central value (determined by the scanner field), yielding a frequency spectrum having a finite line width.\_x000D\_\n[0015]If the spins are widely separated from each other in the material, the spectral line width will be relatively small. If the spins are in fast random relative motion with respect to each other (as in the case of a fluid such as liquid water), such that the local field is rapidly time dependent with a short autocorrelation time, the effective local field is averaged to zero, and the line width will be very small. For the case of typical organic solids, the proton line width may be on the order of several thousand Hertz (Hz) to several tens of kilohertz (kHz). For fluid systems the proton frequency spectrum line width may be on the order of less than 1 Hz to a few hundred Hz.\_x000D\_\n[0016]The line width strongly affects the performance of MR imaging. The inverse of the spectral line width is generally known as T2 if the spectral broadening is due to spin-spin coupling among like (homogeneous, e.g., all proton) spins, and T2\* if the spectral broadening is due to a static (not time dependent) distribution of the intrinsic Larmor frequency unrelated to homogeneous spin-spin coupling. Both types of broadening mechanisms are often present, and T2\* is usually used to denote the total broadening of the spectral line. Therefore, in the remainder of the invention description T2\* will be used in the conventional manner to encompass all the spectral line broadening effects intrinsic to the subject or specimen as well as due to scanner main magnet inhomogeneity. T2\* represents the characteristic time for the MR signal to dephase following an RF pulse, and imposes a limit on both the spatial resolution and the signal-to-noise ratio obtainable in an image. Because the spectral line widths of solid materials, such as bone matrix, are usually far larger than those of fluid materials, such as tissue water or fat, it is expected that images of solid materials are of much lower spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio.\_x000D\_\n[0017]Following the initial RF pulse which elicits a transverse magnetization (the detection and recording of which constitutes the MR signal), the magnetization begins to dephase under the dipole-dipole coupling and other mechanisms. Essentially all conventional MR pulse sequences require the generation and recording of a spin echo, which is the forced rephasing of the dephased signal by the application of a magnetic field gradient pulse reversal or a 180 degree (180°) RF pulse. The T2\* type of broadening may be overcome with the 180° pulse, but the T2 type of broadening cannot be overcome by any simple sequence of RF pulses. Because of certain scanner engineering constraints, the minimum time between the initial RF pulse and the spin echo (the echo time, or TE) can usually be no shorter than a few milliseconds, which limits the line widths to be no greater than a few hundred Hz if the signals are to be detected. Therefore, a solid material (operationally defined here as any substance with T2 less than about 1 ms), including but not limited to bone matrix, cannot be imaged with conventional MR pulse sequences.\_x000D\_\n[0018]One MRI technique which can be used to image solids is referred to as solid state MRI or projection reconstruction MR imaging or projection MRI or even more simply projection imaging. Projection imaging employs only an initial RF pulse and does not elicit spin echoes. The RF pulse elicits a magnetization response referred to as a free induction decay (FID). The FID begins to de-phase immediately following the end of the RF pulse. The FID is ignored in conventional pulse sequences, but may in fact be recorded to create a data set that can be reconstructed into an image. In simple projection imaging (without slice selection), the FID is recorded in the presence of a constant amplitude magnetic field gradient. The magnetic field gradient direction is advanced to a new direction, and the FID is elicited with an RF pulse, and recorded again. The process is repeated to cover all directions in three dimensional space, and the image is reconstructed from the recorded data using one of several possible algorithms to yield a three dimensional image. Because no spin echo is required, short T2 or T2\* does not prevent the projection method from imaging solid materials. However, short T2 or T2\* will still reduce the spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio in projection imaging just as they do in conventional MRI.\_x000D\_\n[0019]Although simple projection imaging can be used to make images of bone matrix, it has a limitation in that all proton containing substances, including bone marrow, will be imaged. Because the marrow proton signals largely arise from fluid substances (e.g. water and fat), their signals will be imaged at relatively high signal-to-noise ratio, and will dominate the signals from the matrix. Thus, since solid state MRI measures both fluid and solid constituents, it cannot be used to effectively measure the volumetric, 3-D density of the organic matrix of bone.\_x000D\_\n[0020]In summary, conventional proton MRI detects only the fluid constituents of bone and thus cannot be used to measure the volumetric, 3-D density of the organic matrix of bone. Solid state MRI, on the other hand, detects both the solid and fluid constituents of a bone and since the fluid constituents obscure the solid constituents, solid state MRI cannot be used to measure the volumetric, 3-D density of the organic matrix of bone. Thus, neither conventional proton MRI nor unmodified solid state MRI can be used to measure the volumetric density of the organic matrix of bone.\_x000D\_\n | 81000 | 8 | 2009-08-11 | 1.

Many of these people need to take injections of insulin to normalize the level of sugar in their bodies to prevent complications. Such complications can include kidney failure, loss of circulation, and blindness. The need to manually take injections with a syringe and the process of determining the dose for various shots can be a great inconvenience and can limit a diabetic's activities and restrict their movements. Furthermore, it can be difficult to maintain a consistent level of blood glucose because there is a practical limit to the number of injections that most patient's can receive.\_x000D\_\n[0004]One solution to reduce some of the problems associated with the manual injection of insulin is an ambulatory pump that delivers insulin to the diabetic user. Such insulin pumps can provide a more consistently normal level of blood glucose, which reduces the risk of complications from diabetes. However, current pumps still have practical limits to their programming that make them cumbersome to program and that limits the potential of the pump to provide even greater control over blood glucose levels.\_x000D\_\n | 71000 | 140 | 2012-08-21 | 1.

Capacitor plates in a MEMS device of the invention are carried on cantilevered opposing micro-scale plates separated by a micro-scale gap under an unstrained condition. At least one of the micro-scale plates may be attached to a substrate or forms a substrate, which may be part of a monitored system. When a load is applied to the substrate, distal ends of the opposing cantilevered micro-scale plates become further separated, resulting in a change of capacitance. The change of capacitance is proportional to a load and therefore is an indication of the strain. Electrodes may be integrated into the strain sensor to provide a connection to measurement circuitry, for example. Sensors of the invention also provide for telemetric communication using radio frequency (RF) energy and can be interrogated without a power supply to the sensor. | GLOBUS MEDICAL, INC. | UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE RESEARCH FOUNDATION, INC. | Company | 2560 GENERAL ARMISTEAD AVENUE, VALLEY FORGE BUSINESS CENTER, 19403, AUDUBON, PENNSYLVANIA | 2301 SOUTH THIRD STREET, JOUETT HALL, SUITE LL02, 40208, LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY | 2024-09-24 | 2024 | 2004-09-24 | [0002]A field of the invention is sensing.

The pivot is located a fixed distance above the longitudinal axis.

Many surgical procedures require cutting and/or ligating large blood vessels and large tissue structures. Due to the inherent spatial considerations of the surgical cavity, surgeons often have difficulty suturing vessels or performing other traditional methods of controlling bleeding, e.g., clamping and/or tying-off transected blood vessels or tissue. By utilizing an elongated electrosurgical forceps, a surgeon can either cauterize, coagulate/desiccate and/or simply reduce or slow bleeding simply by controlling the intensity, frequency and duration of the electrosurgical energy applied through the jaw members to the tissue. Most small blood vessels, i.e., in the range below two millimeters in diameter, can often be closed using standard electrosurgical instruments and techniques. However, larger vessels can be more difficult to close using these standard techniques.\_x000D\_\n[0004]In order to resolve many of the known issues described above and other issues relevant to cauterization and coagulation, a recently developed technology has been developed by Valleylab, Inc. of Boulder, Colo., a division of Tyco Healthcare LP called vessel or tissue sealing. The process of coagulating vessels is fundamentally different than electrosurgical vessel sealing. For the purposes herein, “coagulation” is defined as a process of desiccating tissue wherein the tissue cells are ruptured and dried. “Vessel sealing” or “tissue sealing” is defined as the process of liquefying the collagen in the tissue so that it reforms into a fused mass with limited demarcation between opposing tissue structures. Coagulation of small vessels is sufficient to permanently close them, while larger vessels and tissue need to be sealed to assure permanent closure.\_x000D\_\n[0005]In order to effectively seal larger vessels (or tissue) two predominant mechanical parameters are accurately controlled—the pressure applied to the vessel (tissue) and the gap distance between the electrodes—both of which are affected by the thickness of the sealed vessel. More particularly, accurate application of pressure is important to oppose the walls of the vessel; to reduce the tissue impedance to a low enough value that allows enough electrosurgical energy through the tissue; to overcome the forces of expansion during tissue heating; and to contribute to the end tissue thickness which is an indication of a good seal.\_x000D\_\n[0006]As mentioned above, in order to properly and effectively seal larger vessels or tissue, a greater closure force between opposing jaw members is required. It is known that a large closure force between the jaws typically requires a large moment about the pivot for each jaw. This presents a design challenge because the jaw members are typically affixed with pins which are positioned to have small moment arms with respect to the pivot of each jaw member. A large force, coupled with a small moment arm, is undesirable because the large forces may shear the pins. As a result, designers compensate for these large closure forces by either designing instruments with metal pins and/or by designing instruments which at least partially offload these closure forces to reduce the chances of mechanical failure. As can be appreciated, if metal pivot pins are employed, the metal pins should be insulated to avoid the pin acting as an alternate current path between the jaw members which may prove detrimental to effective sealing.\_x000D\_\n[0007]Increasing the closure forces between electrodes may have other undesirable effects, e.g., it may cause the opposing electrodes to come into close contact with one another which may result in a short circuit and a small closure force may cause pre-mature movement of the tissue during compression and prior to activation.\_x000D\_\n[0008]As a result thereof, providing an instrument which consistently provides the appropriate closure force between opposing electrode within a preferred pressure range will enhance the chances of a successful seal. As can be appreciated, relying on a surgeon to manually provide the appropriate closure force within the appropriate range on a consistent basis would be difficult and the resultant effectiveness and quality of the seal may vary. Moreover, the overall success of creating an effective tissue seal is greatly reliant upon the user's expertise, vision, dexterity, and experience in judging the appropriate closure force to uniformly, consistently and effectively seal the vessel. In other words, the success of the seal would greatly depend upon the ultimate skill of the surgeon rather than the efficiency of the instrument.\_x000D\_\n[0009]It has been found that the pressure range for assuring a consistent and effective seal for large vessels and tissue structures is between about 3 kg/cm2 to about 16 kg/cm2 and, desirably, within a working range of 7 kg/cm2 to 13 kg/cm2. As can be appreciated, manufacturing an instrument which is capable of consistently providing a closure pressure within these working ranges is quite a design challenge for instrument manufacturers.\_x000D\_\n[0010]Various force-actuating assemblies have been developed in the past for providing the appropriate closure forces to affect vessel sealing. For example, one such actuating assembly has been developed by Valleylab, Inc. of Boulder, Colo., a division of Tyco Healthcare LP, for use with Valleylab's vessel sealing and dividing instrument for sealing large vessels and tissue structures commonly sold under the trademark LIGASURE ATLAS®. The LIGASURE ATLAS® is presently designed to fit through a 10 mm cannula and includes a bi-lateral jaw closure mechanism and is activated by a foot switch. Co-pending U.S. application Ser.

The contents of all of these applications are hereby incorporated by reference herein.\_x000D\_\n[0011]Other force-actuating assemblies have also been developed by the Valleylab, Inc. of Boulder, Colo., a division of Tyco Healthcare LP, for use with Valleylab's vessel sealing and dividing instrument for sealing large vessels and tissue structures commonly sold under the trademark LIGASURE 5 mm.™ The LIGASURE 5 mm™ is presently designed to fit through a 5 mm cannula and includes a unilateral jaw closure mechanism and is activated by a hand switch. Co-pending U.S. application Ser. Nos. 10/460,926 and 10/953,757 describe in detail the operating features of the LIGASURE 5 mm™ and various methods relating thereto. The contents of both of these applications are hereby incorporated by reference herein.\_x000D\_\n[0012]It would be desirous to develop a vessel sealing instrument which consistently produces the required mechanical forces necessary to close the jaw members about very large tissue structures within a preferred pressure range. It would also be desirous for the instrument to provide a mechanical advantage for manipulating the jaw members and clamping tissue, such that, for example, the jaw members can be closed on tissue, easier, quicker and with less user force than previously envisioned to clamp the tissue.\_x000D\_\n | 3600000 | 84 | 2011-12-06 | 1.

Peters, published Jan. 9, 2003, for a vascular hole closure device provides the following state of the technology information, “During certain types of vascular surgery, catheters are inserted through an incision in the skin and underlying tissue to access the femoral artery in the patient's leg. The catheter is then inserted through the access opening made in the wall of the femoral artery and guided through the artery to the desired site to perform surgical procedures such as angioplasty or plaque removal. After the surgical procedure is completed and the catheter is removed from the patient, the access hole must be closed. This is quite difficult not only because of the high blood flow from the artery, but also because there are many layers of tissue that must be penetrated to reach the femoral artery.”\_x000D\_\n[0007]United States Patent Application 2002/0133193 published Sep. 19, 2002, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,391,048 issued May 21, 2002, to Richard S. Ginn and W. Martin Belef, for an integrated vascular device with puncture site closure component and sealant and methods of use provides the following state of the technology information, “Catheterization and interventional procedures, such as angioplasty and stenting, generally are performed by inserting a hollow needle through a patient's skin and muscle tissue into the vascular system. A guide wire then is passed through the needle lumen into the patient's blood vessel. The needle is removed and an introducer sheath is advanced over the guide wire into the vessel. A catheter typically is passed through the lumen of the introducer sheath and advanced over the guide wire into position for a medical procedure. The introducer sheath therefore facilitates insertion of various devices into the vessel while minimizing trauma to the vessel wall and minimizing blood loss during a procedure. Upon completion of the medical procedure, the catheter and introducer sheath are removed, leaving a puncture site in the vessel. Commonly, external pressure is applied until clotting and wound sealing occurs. However, this procedure is time consuming and expensive, requiring as much as an hour of a physician's or nurse's time, is uncomfortable for the patient, and requires that the patient be immobilized in the operating room, cathlab, or holding area. Furthermore, a risk of hematoma exists from bleeding prior to hemostasis.”\_x000D\_\n[0008]U.S. Pat. No. 6,174,322 issued Jan. 16, 2001 to Bernhard Schneidt for an Occlusion device for the closure of a physical anomaly such as a vascular aperture or an aperture in a septum provides the following state of the technology information, “The human circulatory system is comprised of a cardiovascular circulation and pulmonary circulation. In the embryonic phase of the development of a human being, the two circulatory systems are joined by the ductus arteriosus. The ductus connects the aorta (systemic circulation) with the pulmonary artery (pulmonary circulation). In the normal development of an infant, this ductus closes after birth. In pathological development, the ductus may not close so that the two circulatory systems remain connected even after birth. This can reduce the life expectancy of the infant. Closure of the ductus by means of a surgical procedure is well-known. However, this procedure is very cost-intensive and is connected with a risk for the patient. Closure of the ductus by means of an IVALON® (polyvinyl alcohol) foam plug (Porstmann method) is also well-known. In this case, a guide rail is introduced via a femoral vein into the aorta, through the ductus into the pulmonary artery and from there through the right ventricle and the right atrium and finally to the outside again via the opposite femoral vein. The ductus plug is then pushed into the ductus where it is “jammed in place.” Owing to the high pressure differential between the aorta and pulmonary artery, high demands are placed on the fixation of the ductus plug within the ductus.”\_x000D\_\n | 1060000 | 3 | 2017-03-21 | 1.

The band from 320 nm to 400 nm is designated as UVA; 280 nm to 320 nm is UVB; and 100 nm to 280 nm is UVC. Germicidal UV light, the type that destroys microorganisms, is limited to a wavelength range from 240 nm to 280 nm, in which maximum germicidal efficiency coincides with a wavelength of 254 nm. UVA and visible light, which includes a near-UV component, have been shown to inhibit growth but not to destroy pathogens.\_x000D\_\n[0006]One concern with harnessing UV light, which is a form of short wavelength, high energy radiation, is that UV light can cause damage to human tissue. Eyes are especially vulnerable when exposed to direct incidence of UV light. Thus, any application of high energy radiation, including UV light, should protect against unwanted exposure.\_x000D\_\n[0007]Many air filtrations systems have filters to clean the air. A typical air filter is the HEPA filter that is designed to remove pollens, dust, smoke and other tiny particles that may attribute to odor. Additionally, some air filtration systems use carbon to help remove pollutants from the air. Other air filters, such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,951,327 and 7,927,554, use titanium dioxide (TiO2), in conjunction with a UV light source, in a process called photo-catalytic oxidation to destroy bacteria, volatile organic compounds, and other airborne pollutants to sanitize the air.\_x000D\_\n | 990000 | 15 | 2015-10-20 | 1.

The use of a tourniquet to stop blood loss from an injured arm or leg is a well-known technique for preventing death in these situations. In general, for emergency use where the victim is alone, the victim must be able to apply the tourniquet to his or her own arm or leg and occlude blood flow using only one hand.\_x000D\_\n[0005]Tourniquets of the prior art generate inward radial compression on the limb by being put into high levels of circumferential tension when wrapped around the limb. As the pressure on the limb increases, the friction between the strap and the limb also increases, causing the underlying soft tissue to move with the strap as it is drawn tight. This tends to draw soft tissues underlying the strap into the ratchet or buckle device, pinching the soft tissue and creating a region of very high localized pressure which will cause unnecessary injury. This effect may also create high shearing stresses in the underlying soft tissues, increasing the probability of nerve and tissue injury. Friction between the strap and the limb may also create regions of low pressure by preventing tension from being distributed evenly in the strap around the entire limb circumference, and as a result, arterial blood may still flow through these low pressure regions although overall strap tension is very high. In general, the application of uneven or non-uniform application of pressure around the limb leads to the need for unnecessarily high overall tourniquet pressures to reliably and predictably stop arterial blood flow, and this need for unnecessarily high pressure increases the probability of a range of unnecessary injuries to nerves, muscles and the limb.\_x000D\_\n[0006]The use of a tourniquet in many emergency situations, including many recreational activities, such as hiking, rock climbing and camping, imposes a weight restriction on the tourniquet. Simply stated, if a tourniquet is too bulky or has an excessive weight, the potential user, such as a hiker, will not pack and carry the tourniquet with them. Therefore, there is a need of a relatively small and light-weight tourniquet that can be easily packed and carried, and subsequently used at remote locations, if necessary.\_x000D\_\n[0007]Accordingly, there is a need for an emergency, light-weight tourniquet that provides improved radial pressure to the wounded limb, thereby restricting blood flow to the limb. Furthermore, there is a need for such a tourniquet that can be applied by the victim using one hand.\_x000D\_\n | 82000 | 50 | 2011-02-22 | 1.

| 154 | US8675935B2 | Fast 3D-2D image registration method with application to continuously guided endoscopy | Fast and continuous registration between two imaging modalities makes it possible to completely determine the rigid transformation between multiple sources at real-time or near real-time frame-rates in order to localize video cameras and register the two sources. A set of reference images are computed or captured within a known environment, with corresponding depth maps and image gradients defining a reference source. Given one frame from a real-time or near-real time video feed, and starting from an initial guess of viewpoint, a real-time video frame is warped to the nearest viewing site of the reference source. An image difference is computed between the warped video frame and the reference image. Steps are repeated for each frame until the viewpoint converges or the next video frame becomes available. The final viewpoint gives an estimate of the relative rotation and translation between the camera at that particular video frame and the reference source. | THE PENN STATE RESEARCH FOUNDATION | Company | 304 OLD MAIN, 16802, UNIVERSITY PARK, PENNSYLVANIA | 2026-05-19 | 2026 | 2005-05-23 | [0003]This invention relates generally to image correlation and, in particular, to a fast image registration method applicable to guided endoscopy and other fields.\_x000D\_\n | 1180000 | 26 | 2014-03-18 | 1.

| 68 | US9302020B2 | Footwear sanitizing and deodorizing system | Introducing ultraviolet (UV) light to activate a light sensitive chemical compound applied to interior portions of footwear alters the environment inside a shoe or other footwear to destroy microorganisms or inhibit their growth. Visible light can also be used to prevent further microorganism growth. Introducing forced air flow through the footwear removes dampness in and thereby deodorizes the footwear. A preferred embodiment comprises an adjustable shoe tree equipped with a UV germicidal light source and electronic safeguards that prevent appreciable leakage of UV radiation outside the shoe. | PEDIFIX, INC. | Company | 301 FIELDS LANE, 10509, BREWSTER, NEW YORK | 2027-03-13 | 2027 | 2006-03-13 | [0003]The present disclosure pertains to the use of light and forced air flow in sanitizing and deodorizing human footwear.\_x000D\_\nBACKGROUND INFORMATION\_x000D\_\n[0004]Warm, damp, dark environments provide favorable conditions for growth of infectious biological microorganisms, allowing bacteria, viruses, fungi, and their associated odors to proliferate. For example, foot perspiration within shoes promotes warmth and dampness, while closed shoes stored in dark closets may fail to admit enough broad spectrum ambient light to control pathogen levels. Excessive levels of harmful microorganisms sustained in enclosed shoes may cause or promote various foot maladies.\_x000D\_\n[0005]It is well-known that exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light of certain wavelengths, intensities, and durations can destroy or inhibit growth of surface pathogens. For instance, germicidal lamps that emit UVC radiation are used to treat waste water for the purpose of reducing organic content. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,981,651 and 5,978,996 describe the use of UV light for sterilization; however, not all UV light wavelengths are germicidal. The UV spectrum spans wavelengths from 10 nm to 400 nm. The band from 320 nm to 400 nm is designated as UVA; 280 nm to 320 nm is UVB; and 100 nm to 280 nm is UVC. Germicidal UV light, the type that destroys microorganisms, is limited to a wavelength range from 240 nm to 280 nm, in which maximum germicidal efficiency coincides with a wavelength of 254 nm. UVA and visible light, which includes a near-UV component, have been shown to inhibit growth but not to destroy pathogens.\_x000D\_\n[0006]One concern with harnessing UV light, which is a form of short wavelength, high energy radiation, is that UV light can cause damage to human tissue. Eyes are especially vulnerable when exposed to direct incidence of UV light. Thus, any application of high energy radiation, including UV light, should protect against unwanted exposure.\_x000D\_\n[0007]Many air filtrations systems have filters to clean the air. A typical air filter is the HEPA filter that is designed to remove pollens, dust, smoke and other tiny particles that may attribute to odor. Additionally, some air filtration systems use carbon to help remove pollutants from the air. Other air filters, such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,951,327 and 7,927,554, use titanium dioxide (TiO2), in conjunction with a UV light source, in a process called photo-catalytic oxidation to destroy bacteria, volatile organic compounds, and other airborne pollutants to sanitize the air.\_x000D\_\n | 990000 | 1 | 2016-04-05 | 1.

Particularly, the present invention relates to rectal balloons that are used for immobilizing the region surrounding the prostate during pre-treatment simulation and target localization, as well as during the delivery of radiation therapy to treat prostate cancer. More particularly, the present invention relates to minimally invasive rectal probes.\_x000D\_\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\_x000D\_\n[0006]Treatment of prostate cancer using radiation therapy is difficult due to the prostate's position near radiation-sensitive tissues, and is further complicated by prostate motion. Adenocarcinoma of the prostate commonly occurs in the posterior portion of the prostate gland, which is in very close proximity to the rectal wall. To date, external beam radiation treatment, urethrograms, CT scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have all been used to visually localize the prostate, as well as the normal critical structures in the surrounding area.\_x000D\_\n[0007]U.S. Pat. No. 5,476,095, issued on Dec. 19, 1995 to Schnall et al., describes an insertable pickup probe for use in providing diagnostic MRI images. The pickup probe, in its preferred embodiment, is for use in imaging the male prostate and comprises an elongated shaft supporting an inflatable patient interface balloon at its distal end. The interface balloon comprises an inner balloon and an outer balloon, between which a receiving coil is positioned. A lumen for air supply is provided in the shaft for expanding the inner balloon against the outer balloon to place the receiving coil in close proximity to the area of interest in order to provide MRI images.\_x000D\_\n[0008]Typically, the planning of radiation therapy for the treatment of prostate cancer involves the patient undergoing a CT-based simulation scan of the pelvis to determine the location of the prostate gland. In the simulation phase, the patient is placed on CT equipment that is preferably similar to the radiation treatment equipment (except that it does not generate the high energy radiation beam). The simulation equipment is positioned to simulate the delivery of the sequence of treatment beams prescribed by the treating oncologist. Normally, during the simulation procedure, CT images are acquired. These CT images allow the oncologist to locate the position of the tumor and help to facilitate the composition of a radiation treatment plan. This treatment plan delineates the positions of the radiation equipment components for delivery of the treatment beams.\_x000D\_\n[0009]During the actual treatment phase, the patient is placed in the same position on the treatment equipment as in the simulation scans. Radiation-emitting devices are generally known and used for radiation therapy in the treatment of patients. Typically, a radiation therapy device includes a gantry, which can be swiveled around a horizontal axis of rotation in the course of a therapeutic treatment. A linear accelerator is located in the gantry for generating a high-energy radiation beam for therapy. During treatment, the radiation beam is provided by this equipment and is delivered to the patient at the precise location as delineated by the physician during simulation. A further feature of radiation therapy involves portal images, which are commonly used in radiation therapy to verify and record the patient tumor location. Portal images include manual (film) and electronic images (EPI) taken before and/or after the treatment.\_x000D\_\n[0010]During external beam radiation therapy, radiation is directed to the target prostate, which is near the rectal wall. A misdirected radiation beam may perforate the rectal wall causing radiation proctitus (rectal bleeding). This toxicity is related to the total radiation dose prescribed and the volume of the anterior rectal wall receiving a high radiation dose. A major factor limiting radiation oncologists' attempts to reduce the volume of the anterior rectal wall receiving a high radiation dose is the position of the prostate gland as well as the intrinsic motion up to 5 mm in the anterior to posterior direction caused by rectal peristalsis. Accordingly, oncologists generally will add a margin to the radiation field in order to ensure that the entire prostate gland receives the prescription dose. This margin is typically on the order of 5 to 15 mm. As a consequence, lower doses of radiation may need to be used so as not to overexpose radiation sensitive structures. However, this may lead to inadequate radiation treatment and a higher probability of local cancer recurrence.\_x000D\_\n[0011]U.S. Patent Publication No. 2003/0028097, published on Feb. 6, 2003 to D'Amico et al., describes an immobolizer probe system and method. This system has an insertable probe for immobilizing a region of interest during staging and radiation therapy thereof. In particular, this device uses a balloon having a rectangular cross section connected to a shaft. The shaft extends to an end of the balloon so as to allow fluid flow through an interior of the shaft and into the balloon so as to selectively inflate the balloon once the balloon is installed into the rectal cavity. The balloon, shaft and handle are bonded together so that they move radially as a single unit when torque is applied. A syringe is provided which connects the shaft and serves as an air pump to deliver a volume-limited amount of air to the air lumen of the shaft to the balloon. A stop cock is provided to maintain the air within the balloon.\_x000D\_\n[0012]One of the problems with the subject of U.S. Patent Publication No. 2003/0028097 is the discomfort associated with installing the rectal balloon within the rectal cavity. In particular, a relatively sturdy and wide diameter shaft is connected to a relatively large thick-walled balloon. Because the balloon is not supported by anything other than by the shaft, the balloon is formed of a relatively rugged and thick material. Because of the relatively large size of the shaft and the thick material of the rectangular-cross section balloon, the installation of the rectal balloon creates a large amount of discomfort for a patient. It is often difficult for the medical personnel to know exactly how far within the rectum the balloon has been installed. It is difficult to achieve a standardized and fixed position of the balloon during each and every use. The medical personnel must generally approximate the desired position of the balloon within the rectal cavity. As such, a need has developed whereby the rectal balloon can be formed of a minimal diameter shaft and of a balloon of relatively thin material.\_x000D\_\n[0013]A second problem with the rectal balloon of U.S. Patent Publication No. 2003/0028097 is that it is “non-conforming” and when squeezed, the shape of the balloon is lost, because there are no interior welds restraining the balloon. Thus, even if shaped when lightly inflated, the shape is lost when squeezed and the balloon bulges wherever it is not squeezed, thus allowing the prostate to slide off its surface. As such, a need developed to provide a rectal balloon that retains the prostate in a proper seated position when the balloon is in a fully inflated or squeezed condition. A balloon that can retain a shape, even when squeezed is known as a “conforming” balloon.\_x000D\_\n[0014]The inventor is also the owner of U.S. Ser. No. 11/623,702 (“the '702 application”), filed on Jan. 16, 2007, and U.S. Ser. No. 11/933,018 (“the '018 application), filed on Oct. 31, 2007. The '018 application is a continuation-in-part of the '702 application. Each of these applications describes a rectal balloon apparatus similar to that of the present invention. Both the '702 and the '018 applications describe a sleeve positioned over the balloon when the balloon is in the uninflated condition. The sleeve maintains the balloon in a tightly juxtaposed position against the shaft for a minimal profile for insertion into the rectum. Additionally, the '018 application describes the sleeve as having a frangible seam such that it can be torn away as it is pulled away from the balloon.\_x000D\_\n[0015]Experimentation also showed that the shape of the surface of the balloon that engages the prostate is of great importance. The '702 application contemplates a seating area for the prostate to be positioned on. The '018 application describes two different inflated conditions of the balloon, each with a unique shape. In the first inflated condition, the balloon has a laterally flat seating area on which the prostate rests. When additional fluid is added to the balloon, it moves to the second inflated condition. In the second inflated condition, the balloon has a laterally flat seating area and a bulbous portion formed at the end of the balloon adjacent to the tip. The bulbous portion works against the natural forces seeking to expel the balloon from the rectum. The location of this bulge serves to contour the seminal vesicles in proper alignment.\_x000D\_\n[0016]U.S. Ser. No. 12/034,470, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,080,031, describes and claims a conforming balloon, wherein an interior weld restrains the balloon such that it is a does not lose shape, even when squeezed in the highly mobile environment of the rectum. In more detail, the balloon is made of three layers, wherein the middle layer is connected to the top layer, to provide a central groove which provides the dimpled seating area into which the prostate is wedged. The weld is shifted distally slightly, so that there is a bit more material proximal to the weld, which when hyperinflated stretches more, providing a proximal bulge, serving to further wedge the seminal vesicles into place.\_x000D\_\n[0017]As discussed above, a very important consideration when treating patients using radiation therapy is that the proper dose of radiation reaches the treatment site. This is very important whether the treatment method utilizes implanted radiation seeds or external beams of radiation. Excessive dosing of the patient can lead to severe side effects including impotence and urinary incontinence. A proper treatment plan should deliver an adequate amount of radiation to the treatment site while minimizing the dose delivered to the surrounding tissues.\_x000D\_\n[0018]U.S. Pat.

| 558 | US7463922B1 | Circuit and method for analyzing a patient's heart function using overlapping analysis windows | A circuit includes a sensor coupled to a processor. The sensor senses an electrical signal that is representative of a patient parameter, and the processor determines a condition of the patient by analyzing first and second overlapping portions of the sensed electrical signal. For example, a portable AED can include such a circuit to sense first and second overlapping sections of an ECG. By utilizing this overlapping-window technique, the AED can obtain and analyze multiple sections of ECG data, and thus can make a shock/no-shock decision, more quickly than an AED using contiguous-window analysis. Thus, the overlapping-window technique allows one to use both longer ECG sections (better accuracy per window) and more of these longer sections (better voting accuracy) over a given analysis time. Furthermore, this overlapping-window technique significantly reduces or eliminates boundary problems because the boundary of one ECG section is within the interior of either the preceding or the following overlapping ECG section. | ZOLL MEDICAL CORPORATION | PHILIPS ELECTRONICS NORTH AMERICA CORPORATION | Company | 269 MILL ROAD, 01824, CHELMSFORD, MASSACHUSETTS | 3000 MINUTEMAN ROAD, 01810, ANDOVER, MASSACHUSETTS | 2024-03-18 | 2024 | 2000-07-13 | [0001]The invention relates generally to electronic circuits and systems, and more particularly to a circuit and method for analyzing a patient's heart function using overlapping analysis windows.

| 430 | US7091683B1 | Method of monitoring and controlling the seating of screws to the optimum point of grip independent of screw size and material density | A method of controlling a motor (106) used to drive a screwdriver bit (105) such that screws (107) are seated to the optimum point of grip between the screw (107) and the work piece material. An electronic control circuit controls the speed and output torque of the motor (106). The control system utilizes pulse width modulation (PWM) to control motor (106) speed and torque. The PWM signal controls the duty cycle of the transistors that supply current to the motor (106). The amount of current flowing through the motor (106) coils is proportional to the amount of torque the motor (106) is producing. Motor (106) current is measured as voltage produced across a precision resistor that is in series with the motor (106) coils. As the current in the motor (106) increases, the voltage across the resistor increases (V=IR). To accurately measure the torque, as measured by the voltage across the precision resistor, a capacitor with a resistor and/or a diode is used to average the analog signal that is measured by the microprocessor. The microprocessor further filters the analog signal using an averaging formula to produce a stable value corresponding to motor (106) torque/current.

State of Technology\_x000D\_\n[0007]U.S. Pat. No. 5,836,868 for an expandable intravascular occlusion material removal devices and methods of use, by Ressemann, et al., patented Nov. 17, 1998, provides the following description: “The present invention generally relates to constructions for intravascular treatment devices useful for removing vascular occlusion material from a vascular occlusion or from a vascular lumen. The invention more specifically relates to expandable intravascular occlusion material removal devices, as well as to methods of using those devices to treat vascular diseases.\_x000D\_\n[0008]Vascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis and the like, have become quite prevalent in the modern day. These diseases may present themselves in a number of forms. Each form of vascular disease may require a different method of treatment to reduce or cure the harmful effects of the disease. Vascular diseases, for example, may take the form of deposits or growths in a patient's vasculature which may restrict, in the case of a partial occlusion, or stop, in the case of a total occlusion, blood flow to a certain portion of the patient's body. This can be particularly serious if, for example, such an occlusion occurs in a portion of the vasculature that supplies vital organs with blood or other necessary fluids.\_x000D\_\n[0009]To treat these diseases, a number of different therapies are being developed. While a number of invasive therapies are available, it is desirable to develop non-invasive therapies as well. Non-invasive therapies may be less risky than invasive ones, and may be more welcomed by the patient because of the possibility of decreased chances of infection, reduced post-operative pain, and less post-operative rehabilitation. One type of non-invasive therapy for vascular diseases is pharmaceutical in nature. Clot-busting drugs have been employed to help break up blood clots which may be blocking a particular vascular lumen. Other drug therapies are also available. Further non-invasive, intravascular treatments exist that are not only pharmaceutical, but also revascularize blood vessels or lumens by mechanical means. Two examples of such intravascular therapies are balloon angioplasty and atherectomy which physically revascularize a portion of a patient's vasculature.\_x000D\_\n[0010]Balloon angioplasty comprises a procedure wherein a balloon catheter is inserted intravascularly into a patient through a relatively small puncture, which may be located proximate the groin, and intravascularly navigated by a treating physician to the occluded vascular site. The balloon catheter includes a balloon or dilating member which is placed adjacent the vascular occlusion and then is inflated. Intravascular inflation of the dilating member by sufficient pressures, on the order of 5 to 12 atmospheres or so, causes the balloon to displace the occluding matter to revascularize the occluded lumen and thereby restore substantially normal blood flow through the revascularized portion of the vasculature. It is to be noted, however, that this procedure does not remove the occluding matter from the patient's vasculature, but displaces it.\_x000D\_\n[0011]While balloon angioplasty is quite successful in substantially revascularizing many vascular lumens by reforming the occluding material, other occlusions may be difficult to treat with angioplasty. Specifically, some intravascular occlusions may be composed of an irregular, loose or heavily calcified material which may extend relatively far along a vessel or may extend adjacent a side branching vessel, and thus are not prone or susceptible to angioplastic treatment. Even if angioplasty is successful, thereby revascularizing the vessel and substantially restoring normal blood flow therethrough, there is a chance that the occlusion may recur. Recurrence of an occlusion may require repeated or alternative treatments given at the same intravascular site.\_x000D\_\n[0012]Accordingly, attempts have been made to develop other alternative mechanical methods of non-invasive, intravascular treatment in an effort to provide another way of revascularizing an occluded vessel and of restoring blood flow through the relevant vasculature. These alternative treatments may have particular utility with certain vascular occlusions, or may provide added benefits to a patient when combined with balloon angioplasty and/or drug therapies.\_x000D\_\n[0013]One such alternative mechanical treatment method involves removal, not displacement, as is the case with balloon angioplasty, of the material occluding a vascular lumen. Such treatment devices, sometimes referred to as atherectomy devices, use a variety of means, such as lasers, and rotating cutters or ablaters, for example, to remove the occluding material. The rotating cutters may be particularly useful in removing certain vascular occlusions. Since vascular occlusions may have different compositions and morphology or shape, a given removal or cutting element may not be suitable for removal of a certain occlusion. Alternatively, if a patient has multiple occlusions in his vasculature, a given removal element may be suitable for removing only one of the occlusions. Suitability of a particular cutting element may be determined by, for example, its size or shape. Thus, a treating physician may have to use a plurality of different treatment devices to provide the patient with complete treatment. This type of procedure can be quite expensive because multiple pieces of equipment may need to be used (such intravascular devices are not reusable because they are inserted directly into the blood stream), and may be tedious to perform because multiple pieces of equipment must be navigated through an often-tortuous vascular path to the treatment site.”\_x000D\_\n[0014]U.S. Pat. No. 5,102,415, for an apparatus for removing blood clots from arteries and veins, by Guenther, et al., patented Apr. 7, 1992, provides the following description: “A triple catheter for removing of blood clots from arteries and veins is equipped with an outer catheter that can be inserted into a blood vessel and an inner catheter with an inflatable balloon at its distal end that can be inserted into the outer catheter. The inner catheter is surrounded by an intermediate catheter also inserted into the outer catheter. The intermediate catheter has a radially expandable distal end receptacle made of an elastic mesh structure of spring wires or plastic monofilaments covered by or embedded in an elastic plastic coating. A very small puncture channel is required for the insertion of such a triple catheter through the wall of a blood vessel.”\_x000D\_\n[0015]U.S. Pat. No. 5,645,564 for microfabricated therapeutic actuator mechanisms, by Northrup, et al., patented Jul. 8, 1997, provides the following description: “Electromechanical microstructures (microgrippers), either integrated circuit (IC) silicon-based or precision machined, to extend and improve the application of catheter-based interventional therapies for the repair of aneurysms in the brain or other interventional clinical therapies. These micromechanisms can be specifically applied to release platinum coils or other materials into bulging portions of the blood vessels also known as aneurysms. The “micro” size of the release mechanism is necessary since the brain vessels are the smallest in the body. Through a catheter more than one meter long, the micromechanism located at one end of the catheter can be manipulated from the other end thereof. The microgripper (micromechanism) of the invention will also find applications in non-medical areas where a remotely actuated microgripper or similar actuator would be useful or where micro-assembling is needed.”\_x000D\_\n[0016]U.S. Pat. No. 6,102,917 for a shape memory polymer (SMP) gripper with a release sensing system, by Maitland, et al., patented Aug. 15, 2000, provides the following description: “A system for releasing a target material, such as an embolic coil from an SMP located at the end of a catheter utilizing an optical arrangement for releasing the material. The system includes a laser, laser driver, display panel, photodetector, fiber optics coupler, fiber optics and connectors, a catheter, and an SMP-based gripper, and includes a release sensing and feedback arrangement. The SMP-based gripper is heated via laser light through an optic fiber causing the gripper to release a target material (e.g., embolic coil for therapeutic treatment of aneurysms). Various embodiments are provided for coupling the laser light into the SMP, which includes specific positioning of the coils, removal of the fiber cladding adjacent the coil, a metal coating on the SMP, doping the SMP with a gradient absorbing dye, tapering the fiber optic end, coating the SMP with low refractive index material, and locating an insert between the fiber optic and the coil.”\_x000D\_\n[0017]U.S. Pat. No. 5,843,118 for fibered micro vaso-occlusive devices, by Sepetka, et al., patented Dec. 1, 1998, provides the following description: “This is a vaso-occlusive device made up of at least one short retainer and a longer fiber bundle. The retainer may be radio-opaque. The fibers may be straight, looped, or tufted. The primary use of the device is in the very small vessels at the distal portion of the vasculature.”\_x000D\_\n[0018]U.S. Pat. No. 5,895,398 for a method of using a clot capture coil, by Wensel, et al., patented Apr. 20, 1999, provides the following description: “A clot and foreign body removal device is described which comprises a catheter with at least one lumen. Located within the catheter is a clot capture coil that is connected to an insertion mandrel. In one embodiment, the clot capture coil is made out of a solid elastic or superelastic material which has shape memory, preferably nitinol. The elasticity or superelasticity of the coil allows it to be deformed within the catheter and to then reform its original coil configuration when the coil is moved outside of the catheter lumen. In another embodiment the coil is a biphasic coil which changes shape upon heating or passing an electric current. Once the coil configuration has been established, the coil can be used to ensnare and corkscrew a clot in a vessel. A clot is extracted from the vessel by moving the clot capture coil and catheter proximally until the clot can be removed or released into a different vessel that does not perfuse a critical organ. Foreign bodies are similarly captured by deploying the coil distal to the foreign body and moving the clot capture coil proximally until the foreign body is trapped within the coil. By removing the device from the body, the foreign material is also removed.”\_x000D\_\n[0019]Patents and patent applications that provide additional background information include: U.S. Pat.

| 474 | US7257237B1 | Real time markerless motion tracking using linked kinematic chains | A markerless method is described for tracking the motion of subjects in a three dimensional environment using a model based on linked kinematic chains. The invention is suitable for tracking robotic, animal or human subjects in real-time using a single computer with inexpensive video equipment, and does not require the use of markers or specialized clothing. A simple model of rigid linked segments is constructed of the subject and tracked using three dimensional volumetric data collected by a multiple camera video imaging system. A physics based method is then used to compute forces to align the model with subsequent volumetric data sets in real-time. The method is able to handle occlusion of segments and accommodates joint limits, velocity constraints, and collision constraints and provides for error recovery. The method further provides for elimination of singularities in Jacobian based calculations, which has been problematic in alternative methods. | NATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS OF SANDIA, LLC | Company | P.O.
