## File: MintLeads/Business Analysis_2022.pdf

2018 ‐ 2022

ANALYSIS: We have a very good chance of closing business with existing clients
Tradeshows generate few leads and few signed proposals
Before BBM, Existing Clients made up 50% of our leads, and with BBM looks like website and referrals

have increased to bring in 64% of our leads

We convert an average of 55% of our leads to proposals (^not counting 2022)
Our average Close Rate, if a proposal is sent, is 49% (^not counting 2022)
Our average Close Rate overall is 27% (^not counting 2022)

Start‐ups makeup ~40% of our leads, and corporate ~60%
The ratio of signed proposals for start‐ups vs. corporate is 50/50
The odds of closing a start‐up project vs. corporate project are about the same, 24%

Slingshot NOTEs:

The number of proposals we can produce a year appears to remain fairly consistent,
even as the number of leads increased. Perhaps this is due to the fact that
our proposal generation rate hasn't been able to increase until recently (end 2022)
with the addition of Amber to help speed things up.

Busiest months for receiving new leads are April and Sept., followed closely by Oct.
Busiest months for signing proposals are Feb., May, Aug., Oct.
Slowest months for receiving new leads are Jan.
Slowest months for signing proposals are Nov. and June

We average 16 proposals/year (1‐2 per month) (~5 per quarter)
Q4 is the worst quarter for getting signed proposals

Overview

Nebuscent has worked with Slingshot to date on the following new product development pathway.

an employee-owned company

Project to date

•  Phase 1:

o  Slingshot Brainstormed and Ideated a range of approaches to a mechanical Aerosol delivery

system with no electrical power.

o  Merged and selected most likely solutions.

•  Phase 2A:

o  Slingshot identified two key approaches to viable design directions for a mechanical aerosol

delivery system.

o  Early testing was conducted to identify the leading concept.
o  Leading concept down-selected.
o  Early formulation concepts developed & tested.

•  Phase 2B

o  Slingshot Built advanced Alpha Prototype product mechanism and cartridge to refine early

product mechanism.

o  The advanced Alpha Prototype worked, except the client realized that the unit may be too

expensive to be considered “disposable”.  An alternative "Razor/Razorblade” concept:  with a
durable dispenser and a disposable formulation dispenser was then developed through a
change in scope. to drastically reduce the overall cost per single use.

o  Slingshot incorporated Industrial Design into a functional Beta Design to generate first “looks

like” and “works-like” prototype.

Next Steps

•  Phase 3:

o  Conversion to Manufacturing

Approaches to Avoid

•  No use of CFC aerosol propellent as part of aerosol delivery
•  Delivery System shall receive no electrical power from battery or mains supply
•  No significant solid waste generated during single use aerosol deployment

Project Plan

Phase 3: Conversion to Manufacturing

In Phase-3, Slingshot will refine the ‘design for prototyping’ engineering approach of Phase 2 with a ‘design
for manufacturing’ approach to all of the components in this product assembly.

Slingshot will also refine and simplify the design of the unit mechanism through two iterations of design and
field testing. The unit currently comprises 40 unique parts with a total of 60-75 parts. The purpose of these
steps is to reduce the number of unique parts, simplify the mechanism’s operation and increase its
reliability.

This will be achieved by conducting a progressive ‘controlled conversion’ of parts from their ‘prototype
design version’ to their final production ready design. The effect of introducing these modified parts to the
mechanism will then be progressively monitored through field testing.

for our clients. We value our client’s successes, and work hard to ensure the products we create for them are successful in growing their
businesses.

Service Differentiation

What makes you different from your competitors? What is your “special sauce”?

Our special sauce is the inclusion of Science & Technology at the fore-front of all of our work.

Project Management is critical to our success, as many of our competitors make the mistake of relying on each engineer/designer to manage
their own projects and typically those types of people don’t do well in this area, causing project failure and client relationship failure.

Additionally, we utilize highly skilled experts in a very wide range of fields, rather than interns or junior professionals.

Nigel & I have spent a lot of time handpicking and training our people to work in this field. The people that we surround ourselves with are
multi-faceted and passionate about the work they do.

Our fixed-fee model is also unique to the business, as the majority of our competitors charge by the hour.

Client Pain Points
How would your customer describe their problem in their own words?

Examples of Client Intro. Conversations:

“Nigel, I want to identify new products and new markets for our company to expand”

“As I was thinking more about some potential projects, it occurred to me we are close to kicking off an updated version of a controller we
currently sell. When I look at the proposed concepts, I’m not excited about it. This might be a good fast turn opportunity to consider.”

“My name is George S. and I believe your team has connected with our team in the past. We have a design challenge at this time and I
wanted to get some insight to your company on how we can potentially proceed with a design improvement on a production product. I would
like to know what information will be requested from us and what output you can provide as a solution. Additionally, examples of a similar case
you have faced in the past with improvement on a running production part will be helpful in our decision.”

Client’s come to us for a variety of reasons:

•Churning/Active R&D projects, constantly looking for new opportunities

What is your average order value? What are your “Starting At” costs for your services?

Our average program value is $110K, with a range from $10K to $1MM.
Our average “phase of work” within a program is <$50K

Projects/Phases of Work breakdown (from 2016 through 2023):
< $50K is 75% of our business …. These would be R&D programs that did not continue into engineering and commercialization
$50K - $100K is 8% of our business



---

> $100K is 17% of our business …. These are R&D programs that DID continue into engineering and commercialization

“Starting At” costs are typically $10 - 20K for looking at patentability and technology/idea viability. This would be considered “Phase 0”. A
Phase 1, consists of a full brainstorm and down-selection to a single concept. Phase 1 typically costs $30K - $50K. This is really the smallest
we can go. There is not much we can do, for say, $5K.

HOWEVER - there is a new service that we are just starting to offer (not yet advertised for) in which we believe we can take a client’s existing
CAD and create Photorealistic Marketing Renderings for about $5K, so a client could use these to sell an idea internally to management, or for
pre-sales, etc. externally.

Preferred Method of Communication

Mode of contact (Phone/Email/Text)
In the case where either contacts are on vacation, how can we reach out with updates or questions about the
campaign?
This will never happen. But texting would be the fastest method.

message is a good option if you don’t hear from us by email.
