## The Slingshot Story

Slingshot has developed over 1,000 new products since 2001. The company began by first merging the disciplines of **Industrial Design and Engineering** into a single, unified product development process. Slingshot quickly added manufacturing services to assist clients with sourcing and management of product supply chains. In 2009, Slingshot expanded the company’s new product development services to include Science and Technology with core competences in **chemistry, materials science, biological sciences and STEM disciplines** to expand the range and capability of new product development work. As part of this expansion, the company established a science and technology laboratory, complementing its existing mechanical and electrical engineering labs.

In 2016, Principals **Taylor Leigh** and **Nigel Flynn**, acquired Slingshot from its previous owners and have enjoyed significant growth in the years since. The company relocated in 2020 to purpose-built office and labs in Duluth, GA.

Slingshot’s product development process is **tried and tested**, and undoubtably a success factor. Our clients leave our process with new products and a new understanding of how products are developed.

## Setting the Standard at Georgia Tech

In 2003 Slingshot was approached by the founding faculty members of The Wallace Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering (BME) at The Georgia Institute of Technology to develop a New Product Development program for undergraduates, based on Slingshot’s proven methodology.

Since its inception nearly two decades ago the **BME program** has rapidly grown, and now includes **70 faculty members** and more than **1500 enrolled students**. The department’s undergraduate program is now ranked No. 2 in the US, and the graduate program is currently No. 3 nationally. It’s a remarkable accomplishment, in record time.

Today, thousands of **Georgia Tech BME graduates** employ the Slingshot Method as the de facto standard for new product development in their working careers throughout the world.
