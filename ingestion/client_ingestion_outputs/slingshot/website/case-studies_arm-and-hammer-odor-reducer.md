# Taking Baking Soda Out of the Box

Slingshot identified ‘baking soda impregnated paper’ as an ideal solution to combat odor control challenges. This development was a true breakthrough in a 160 year-old consumer product industry. In all that time, nobody had ever thought of introducing baking soda into paper. Slingshot was the first to impregnate paper with baking soda, resulting in a ten-fold performance improvement, and securing valuable intellectual property for Prym.

## Client

### Prym Consumer USA licenses the Arm & Hammer™ brand

## Unmet Need

Prym wanted to participate in the extended lifespan of a garment once it was created by the hobbyist.

## Scope

Prym approached Slingshot to extend their reach into garment care products. Slingshot explored a range of garment care approaches and identified an unmet need for superior odor control products through the use of the Arm & Hammer™ brand.
