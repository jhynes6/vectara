# Inventing in the Age of Covid-19

**Personal whiteboard markers? Multi-site preparation?**

In these unprecedented times, what exactly allows Slingshot Product Development Group to ideate new product solutions for clients while safely working from remote locations?

“I’d imagine that the combined 200+ years of new product development and commercialization experience in our team likely plays a role…” offered Dr. Nigel Flynn, Principal of Slingshot. Regardless of COVID-19, it’s vital for companies to maintain their brand vitality through planned new product launches. “We’ve adapted new ways to execute our ideation process effectively, yet safely, to serve our clients over multiple remote locations.” Added Slingshot Principal, Taylor Leigh.

Indeed, the secret to Slingshot’s ideation is a rigorous and disciplined approach, honed over 20 years involving divergent and convergent thinking. The technique generates consistent results as evidenced by the development of an estimated 1,000 new products for approximately 250 clients over that period. “We are basic in the physical and life sciences, which supports a broad range of chemical, material, biological, and electronic invention, in addition to our product design capabilities. Virtual or not, that key differentiating factor will never change!” stated Dr. Jason Lye, VP of Technology & Patent Strategy.

In retrospect, the modifications to Slingshot’s process were common sense but effective: “Above and beyond hand sanitizers and face masks, we realized that increased engagement was key: The client’s site was rigorously prepared against a check list, including sound & video tests, distributing samples ahead of time, and ensuring that the client also had whiteboards and cameras at each site to convey ideas graphically. Physical challenge icebreaker activities that could be executed remotely and evidenced over video link proved to be superb remote engagement tools. Frequent breaks helped our video-from-home participants stay focused, while our industrial designer, Noah Underwood was kept safe using personalized markers as they captured ideas graphically at the whiteboards in real time.” Explained Peter Shipp, VP of Innovation.
