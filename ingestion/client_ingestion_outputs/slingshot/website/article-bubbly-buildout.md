# Bubbly Build-Out

Away from the clutter, buzz-saws, hammers, and hand-drills of construction, and now in the air-conditioned peace of a wine store, his discerning eyes darted from bottle to bottle, carefully interrogating each label with a furrowed brow… “No, it is not just an excuse for a champagne opening party…” Nigel insisted “…but it certainly will be cause for a celebration once we’re moved in!” he added with a broad grin, flourishing a magnum of judiciously selected bubbly.

After 20 years of successful invention at the ‘old faithful’ offices, Slingshot Product Development Group has commissioned the construction of a new purpose-built innovation center, just north of Atlanta GA. Taylor interrupted her study of floorplans to explain. “Our home has served us well for many years – but as demand for our services has grown, it’s time for us to construct the space we need to accommodate our expanding team.” In particular, the past few years have seen increased demand for Slingshot’s ‘Science and Technology’ services, allowing clients to reduce development risk by providing the necessary horsepower to support their R&D teams.

Customized chemistry, life sciences, electrical, and mechanical engineering laboratories are being plumbed, fitted, and energized, while what can only be described as a ‘brainstormer’s dream’ ideation area awaits installation of an audio video link technology for remote connections. Clearly a work yet in progress, studwork and framing hint at future office and product development spaces yet to be revealed, but for wallboard offcuts and dangling wire conduit. However, the purpose-built labs have been laid out with flexibility in mind, reflecting the broad diversity of projects that include medical devices, consumer, industrial, and military products.

The build-out is expected to be complete before year end, so stay tuned for grand opening announcements. Slingshot is eager to leverage their new purpose-built facility to help accelerate your path to market with great new products. Let’s work on this together in January, the team will be there for you… maybe with Nigel’s glass of bubbly too!

Nigel Flynn and Taylor Leigh are Principals of Slingshot Product Development Group.
