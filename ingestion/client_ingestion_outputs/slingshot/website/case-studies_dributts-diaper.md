# Slingshot Mentality: Help Those in Need

Slingshot’s is motivated to transform the world through design and cost-effective manufacture. When Slingshot was approached by Dributts, we felt a passion to help the Dributts charity to save lives. Slingshot took the DriButts design, optimized it for manufacturing, and arranged to have the diapers produced through our global manufacturing resources.

## Client

### Dributts

## Unmet Need

Convert Dributts’ hand-sewn diaper into a high volume, manufactured product.

## Scope

Infants and toddlers in underdeveloped villages in Haiti don’t have diapers, so they poop openly in the house. The fecal matter contaminates everything in the living space which leads to the rampant spread of diseases like dysentery, cholera, typhus fever, and typhoid. Dributts had the diaper design ready and approached Slingshot to develop a manufacturing resource in order to deliver thousands of diapers.

Accomplishments

* Slingshot’s global manufacturing resources reduced the cost by 50% and increased supply by 10 to 100 times
* As of 2018, this product continues to be produced through Slingshot’s manufacturing partners

## Technical Innovation Breakthroughs

* Slingshot delivered a manufacturing resource that could produce 10,000 or more diapers quicker, and at a lower cost than hand-sewing them.

## Services Provided

* Manufacturing Sourcing, Quality Control, and Other Guidance
