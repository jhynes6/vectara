# “All cupcake liners are not created equal”

The goal was to improve cupcake liners by preventing soggy grease from transferring through the liner and destroying the final appearance of the cupcake liner designs. Slingshot re-engineered the clients existing product to generate a high greaseproof performance liner.

## Client

### Sweets & Treats

## Unmet Need

Client wanted to create quick-turn custom cupcake liner designs through domestic manufacturing sources

## Scope

Sweets & Treats approached Slingshot to find a domestic source of greaseproof cupcake liners that maintained the high performance and could also be ordered in smaller quantities.

Accomplishments

*   Slingshot defined the characteristics necessary for high performance greaseproof liner paper.
*   Identified multiple domestic manufacturing sources.
*   Sweets & Treats is successfully selling quick-turn custom liner designs to this day.

## Technical Innovation Breakthroughs

*   Identified a greaseproof paper that prevented cupcake batter from transferring through the liner when used with both light and dark cupcakes.
*   The paper liner had to work on batters in which an emulsifier, such as sour cream, is included.
*   The manufacturing process had to support registered prints with up to four colors and short run options.
