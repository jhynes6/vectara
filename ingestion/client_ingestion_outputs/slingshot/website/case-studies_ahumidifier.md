# Utilizing Digital Manufacturing

Slingshot combined knowledge and research in emerging digital printing technologies to identify a route to manufacture that would allow cost-effective high and low production quantities.

## Client

### A+ Corporation

## Unmet Need

Client wanted to provide customers with a private label option for their Humidisorb products.

## Scope

A+ Corporation had a problem. They had a growing number of potential new customers who wanted a private label option, but their existing manufacturing process made this impossible to offer in low quantities. Slingshot helped them find a solution to creating custom SKUs while improving the throughput and efficiency of their existing products.

Accomplishments

* Built equipment and material specification for future private label product growth
* Slingshot trialed and sourced a fully automated product conversion machine, which the Client later purchased and installed in their facility
* Slingshot created new and exciting concepts for future products utilizing the Clientâ€™s technology
* There was no additional cost to product

## Technical Innovation Breakthroughs

* Identified a replacement material capable of being digitally printed and heat sealed. This material also provided the same moisture vapor permeability and shelf life as their existing product.
* Created a manufacturing process that enabled the production of both low and high order quantities.

## Services Provided

* Ideation
* Materials Selection and Testing
* Equipment Sourcing and Trials
* Cost and Process Analysis
