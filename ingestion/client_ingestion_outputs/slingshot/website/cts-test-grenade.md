# Chemistry Meets Hardware

Electronic acoustics alone were not sufficient in creating an immersive battlefield training experience. To achieve the correct effect, Slingshot identified and implemented a chemistry to simulate both the visual and olfactory effects of the M67 Hand Grenade.

## Client

### Combat Training Solutions (CTS)

## Unmet Need

CTS required the development of a training hand grenade that mimicked the weight, size, and explosive characteristics of a real grenade while ensuring the safety of new recruits by preventing injury or death during training.

## Scope

Slingshot was tasked with creating an immersive, non-lethal test grenade. The grenade needed to simulate the explosion, flash, sound, and smoke effects of a real grenade and must be compatible with MILES technology for collecting data on simulated battlefield injuries and mortality during live-fire training exercises.

### Accomplishments

*   **Realism**: Successfully developed a fully functional test grenade that provides a realistic battlefield experience.
*   **Reusability**: The grenade was designed to be reused up to 50 times, significantly reducing training costs.
*   **Specifications**: Maintained the dimensions and weight of an M67 Hand Grenade, ensuring that recruits are familiar with its handling.

### Technical Innovation Breakthroughs

*   Created a non-lethal explosive simulation product that effectively blends realism with safety.
*   Implemented a chemical solution to replicate both the visual and olfactory effects associated with the M67 Hand Grenade, enhancing the overall training experience.
