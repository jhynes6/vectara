# Accelerating Science for Use in the Real World

Bomax came to Slingshot with technology that had lain dormant for three years in a Ph.D. dissertation. They had a patent and financial support, but no idea what to do next. Slingshot guided Bomax through the process.

## Client

### Bomax Hydrogen

## Unmet Need

Providing environmentally-friendly, pure Hydrogen for fuel & other uses.

## Scope

Bomax approached Slingshot Product Development Group to create a structured plan for technology validation, development, and commercialization.

### Accomplishments

* Secured the employment of three key professionals, experienced in the art of this specialized chemical reaction.
* Sourced and purchased scientific equipment for the Bomax lab, allowing it to open in May 2016, on time and on budget. The Bomax lab later expanded into additional space.
* By December 2016, just eight months later, the Company had duplicated, replicated, and validated the original BPH work of the founder.
* Slingshot strengthened their intellectual property filings, identified trade secrets, as well as improved and standardized their BPH production processes.
* In March 2017, a mere three months after completing the validation phase, the Company accomplished the first of four 10-fold increases in hydrogen production.

### Technical Innovation Breakthroughs

* Advising academic and business leadership about the processes and realities of commercializing early-stage technology.
* Identifying appropriate laboratory equipment, materials, and personnel to conduct highly specialized anaerobic chemistry (a skill-set shared by a small cadre of people in the world).
* Creating tangible value for Bomax, in its early stage of life.
* Accelerating the R&D Plan to meet the timing goals of America’s “Hydrogen Highway.”
