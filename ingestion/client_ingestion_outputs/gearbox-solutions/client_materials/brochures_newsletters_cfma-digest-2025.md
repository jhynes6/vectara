I just saw an email from the AGC advertising Speedchain as a member discount program. So, I got looking and it appears they are offering a product similar to Finvari,
who are just about to implement. Can anyone compare or contrast the two products for us?

In Office E-Notary Options?

We would like to go paperless for our AIA/waiver signing, but the options we have looked at for e-notary services seem very costly to us (Pactima, Notarize, Docusign,
among others).  We have around 70 to 80 pay apps + waivers each month.  Has anyone else gone paperless in this process, and if so, how costly has it been and who
would you recommend, or even what other avenues would you recommend?

Thank you!

I know nothing about Speedchain, but we implemented Finvari about a year ago and are super happy!  Super easy to use, very easy implementation and has saved
our AP persons many hours every month.  Highly recommend.

Similar to the other responses, I am not aware of Speedchain, but we implemented Finvari earlier this year and it was transformative.  It streamlined our process and
we now have more accurate cost data.  Our receipt capture is close to 100%, compared to less than 50% with our Wex card.  The transactions along with the attached
receipts are captured in Viewpoint Vista seamlessly.  This was by far the most successful and popular implementation of an application our finance team ever
completed.

I am with the others, I have not heard of Speedchain but can give glowing reviews for Finvari, we implemented about a year ago and I have zero complaints. Our
accounting department processes have improved significantly and the superintendents and users have all given GREAT feedback. Implementation was seamless and
their customer service is top notch. Also highly recommend!

Hi John, I highly recommend Finvari if you are on any of their fully integrated ERP's. We are working on shortening our month end close and having the weekly
expense recognition is crucial. Not to mention Finvari was extremely easy to implement.

I don't know anything about Speedchain but I can strongly recommend Finvari. SAK has been using Finvari for almost 2 years and we have been extremely satisfied.
The mobile app is very friendly (even a nontechnical person like me can understand it) and all coding links directly with our ERP system (VP).  All transactions can be
coded immediately so there is no time-consuming month-end process for our cardholders and approvers. To enhance the follow-up on employee data entry and
approvers, their reports show how long to took each person to enter the data and submit their approval.... they can't hide! The integration with VP was seamless and it
has saved our Accounting department 25+ hours of processing time each month. Lastly, their customer service team is extremely responsive and helpful. Please let me
know if you have any questions.

I hate jumping on the bandwagon, but I've never heard of Speedchain. Our company implemented Finvari over a year and a half ago and only wish we had done so
sooner.  It has allowed us so much more control over employee spending and receipt retention. The ability to capture receipts on a mobile device is a gamechanger
that saves the employee time since they no longer need to scan or email receipts to accounting.  And our ability to define coding rules allows for more consistent GL
coding throughout our organization. I would highly recommend Finvari.

Hi John.  I am sure you have heard a lot of good things about Finvari.  We implemented a year ago and could not be happier.  Implementation was easy, and they
respond to support questions very quickly.  All of our cardholders say their expense reporting mobile app and desktop are awesome.  We now have timely credit card
expenses imported into Spectrum, and we balance the Spectrum import with Finvari weekly.  It's the best!

Hi John,

We implemented Finvari late last year and have been extremely happy with the results.  We are on the CMiC platform which integrates well with Finvari.  We have over
70 cards with four different companies using them.  The amount of time that we have saved managing our credit card transactions with Finvari versus our previous
vendor has been significant.  The ease of coding transactions and capturing receipts has also been a great benefit.  Finally, the customer service provided by Finvari
has been over the top.  Nothing but good things to say about this company.

We've helped a few clients leverage PowerAutomate and a few other tools within their Microsoft 365 licenses to create a paperless process using the functionality of
Adobe to sign, but without the paid licensing model.  In the case of the lien waiver, with the Azure Function App, we were able to generate a lien waiver with the
appropriate information from their ERP and automatically send it to the relevant party, a subcontractor in this case. When the subcontractor emailed the signed PDF
back, we were able to capture the signature, download the file and automatically store it in their Sharepoint library.  Feel free to reach out and I can walk you through
the workflow.  This is a great use case for automation and leveraging many of the tools in the Microsoft ecosystem.

Thanks, Kathryn

We use Adobe Sign which is part of Adobe Pro.  We only pay $155 per month but we only need 5 licenses so I'm not sure what your needs would be.  We really like it,
especially the price point.  If you have an Adobe Pro subscription, Adobe Sign is included.

Good luck!

Take Control of Your AI - Join Our OLLAMA Training!

It's great to see how many teams are using Microsoft Copilot to handle everyday tasks like spreadsheet formatting and conversions. But if you want more control over
how AI works for you - especially for sensitive data - running models locally is the next step.

OLLAMA makes this possible by letting you run large language models right on your own machine, behind your firewall - so your data stays private and you're not
dependent on cloud APIs.

In this hands-on session, we'll show you:

 What OLLAMA is (and isn't!)

 How to run and manage open-source LLMs locally

 Examples of realistic use cases - like automating simple text-based tasks, drafting summaries, or testing custom prompts for your workflow

 Tips to keep your data secure and your models performing well

Want to see what local AI could do for you?

 Sign up for the training here

Let's explore how to go beyond Copilot - with AI that you fully control.

Joe,

Just curious where you landed on this issue?  Do you now offer any WFH?

We are a relationship based company and feel in person works best for us, especially considering our field staff do not have the option of working remotely.  However,
as we have grown, we are finding we may need to rethink our position.

We currently offer remote work in one-off situations like a repair at home or vehicle issue, but nothing on a regular basis.  We have been noticing more frequent
absences in our Accounting team and there is some frustration because as we have grown some other departments are allowing regular WFH for their office team.

Just wondering what you decided.

I'm hoping someone can help give me some guidance. My title changed recently from Controller to CFO. I have changed my title in my profile probably 15 times and
every time I log into this website my title has reverted back to Controller. Is there a way to make my title change permanent? Is there somewhere else I'm supposed to
change it to make it permanent?

We currently have an out-of-town project with an expected duration of eight months. I have arranged for a fully furnished apartment to be leased for the crew. They
receive a daily per diem rate of $63 for meals and $5 for incidentals on non-travel days. My question is, should I allow household items, such as paper goods,
detergent, and cleaning supplies, to be charged and paid for by the company? We rarely work out of town, and I am trying to mitigate costs and establish a system for
future projects that require travel. What are your policies?

What are your travel pay policies for hourly employees, do you pay their wages for the trip home?

I appreciate your help!

I just saw an email from the AGC advertising Speedchain as a member discount program. So, I got looking and it appears they are offering a product similar to Finvari,
who are just about to implement. Can anyone compare or contrast the two products for us?

We are also on Finvari, I pursued them for over a year.  Our issue was having Sage 100 Contractor.  Chasing receipts has gone from hours and days to if you do not
turn your receipts in by the following Monday the card gets cut off.  We have a 100% success rate weekly now.  The only issues we have is 1 it does not automatically
export 2 data is not being shown on the vendor accounts, it does show as a job cost 3 they are still working on some reporting, it is lackluster but hopefully they will get
there.  We are in the infancy of data migration and moving to Acumatica - my hopes is that these issues will change moving from Sage.  We could not be happier
overall with Finvari.  No it does not give points or rewards however for no fees and the amount of human hours saved (by field personnel and accounting) it is very well
worth it.

We jumped on the Finvari train last fall and we still haven't found a downside to the move.  We use Foundation for our ERP and our import of data takes about 10
minutes a week.  I've completely eliminated a roll in our accounting department because our CC expense capture efforts have been reduced to almost nothing.  Our
field personnel love the new process and all of our card holders (~50) are capturing receipts and coding their expenses prior to Tuesday the following week.  Admin
interface with cardholders is pretty much real time.  There are so many options to setup your coding requirements, user groups, spend limitations, increases, etc.  One
of my favorites is the option to push a charge back to the card holder if they make a mistake and charge personal expenses on the company card.    We have nothing
but great things to say about Finvari.

I can only echo what others have already said - not familiar with Speedchain at all but I'm glad we found Finvari when we did.  We have
been with them about two years and have 200+ cards in the ﬁeld.  We are on Viewpoint Vista and the integration is seamless with
weekly posts to job cost and easy uploading of receipts to Vista.  As I've told others, Finvari is one of the view software platforms that I
can say truly lived up to how we were told it would work, and the customer service is outstanding.  I think the key is having a platform
that syncs well with your ERP, pulls in phase codes and cost types, jobs, etc.  Good luck!

Finvari - is it any different from Corpay Expense Track?  Does it integrate with Vista better/differently than Corpay?

We too are a Mechanical contractor (although on a much smaller scale) and we have the same issue with being relationship based with field personnel who don't have
a WFH option.  We moved to a hybrid approach where everyone is in the office a minimum of 3 days a week.  We laid out the tasking that we always have to have the
ability to cover in the office each day by Accounting and staggered the staffing days in/out so that someone is here each day to cover any task.  You days each week
are the same and everyone is in on Tuesdays so we all are here one day a week.  We also made it that if there is a meeting you need to be at on one of your
"scheuduled" WFH day, too bad and you need to come in the office for the meeting.  We aren't going to try to run the business from "who is in the office what days".
We also try to make sure if you do need to be at home on one of your normal office days, you flip days that week so you in the office on one of your WFH days so you
are still in here 3 days a week.

Not perfect, but it has worked to allow that WFH along with the be in the office.

Just curious where you landed on this issue?  Do you now offer any WFH?

We are a relationship based company and feel in person works best for us, especially considering our field staff do not have the option of working remotely.  However,
as we have grown, we are finding we may need to rethink our position.

We currently offer remote work in one-off situations like a repair at home or vehicle issue, but nothing on a regular basis.  We have been noticing more frequent
absences in our Accounting team and there is some frustration because as we have grown some other departments are allowing regular WFH for their office team.

Just wondering what you decided.

Thanks!

PCI Compliance: A Money-Driven "Security" Standard?

Many in the industry argue that PCI compliance is, at best, a well-marketed shield and, at worst, a scam that gives merchants a false
sense of security while generating revenue for the card companies and service providers. PCI DSS compliance can be a useful starting
point, but it shouldn't be the end of a company's security efforts.

Real security requires a proactive approach that goes beyond a checklist and adapts to the changing threat landscape. For businesses, this
means investing in comprehensive cybersecurity practices, training employees, and treating PCI compliance as just one part of a broader
security strategy.

The Origins of PCI Compliance

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) was established in 2006 by the Payment Card Industry Security
Standards Council (PCI SSC). This council was founded by major credit card companies-Visa, MasterCard, American Express,
Discover, and JCB-to create unified security standards and address the rising problem of payment data breaches. Though well-
intentioned, PCI DSS was largely a response to the growing number of breaches costing card brands billions in fraudulent transactions and
chargebacks. The primary objective? Protecting payment data and reducing fraud, while also shifting some of the accountability and
costs to merchants.

The Real Beneficiaries of PCI Compliance

PCI DSS quickly became a multi-billion-dollar industry. The compliance ecosystem expanded to include Qualified Security Assessors
(QSAs), software vendors, consulting firms, and hardware manufacturers who provide products, services, and consulting to help
businesses "become compliant." Each business that accepts card payments must comply, meaning thousands of companies pay millions
annually for PCI-related expenses, such as audits, vulnerability scanning, and specialized software.

However, the biggest revenue drivers are often credit card processors and acquirers, who require merchants to meet PCI standards to
process payments. These entities frequently charge merchants a PCI compliance fee or non-compliance fee if standards are not met,
which adds a steady income stream. We've seen annual PCI compliance fees up to $250 with an additional $150 a month for non-
compliance, which amounts to around a 900% markup.

Some argue that PCI DSS has created a market where vendors push costly solutions without delivering real security. After all, achieving
PCI compliance is just a snapshot-a merchant may be compliant today, yet vulnerable tomorrow. And who benefits from this? Mostly, it's
the processors, QSAs, and vendors, who profit regardless of the merchant's actual security posture.

Passing PCI Doesn't Mean You're Secure

One of the largest misconceptions is that being PCI compliant guarantees data security. PCI compliance is an annual survey (often a
Self-Assessment Questionnaire or SAQ for small businesses) with little hands-on validation. The fact is, data breaches can and do
happen to PCI-compliant companies. Companies like Target, Home Depot, and TJX were all PCI-compliant yet suffered massive data
breaches.

The problem is that PCI compliance focuses on meeting a set of baseline standards rather than addressing the nuanced security needs of
individual businesses. Security experts argue that a checklist-based approach is ineffective at preventing sophisticated attacks. Threat
landscapes change rapidly, and hackers constantly adapt to exploit vulnerabilities, so meeting last year's compliance standard can be
irrelevant to today's risks.

The Real Cost of a Breach for PCI-Compliant Companies

When a PCI-compliant business experiences a breach, the financial fallout can be devastating. Despite being compliant, merchants are
still held financially responsible, often facing:

Hefty fines from credit card brands
Lawsuits and settlements with customers
Costly forensic investigations to identify how the breach occurred
Brand reputation damage, resulting in lost business

In reality, PCI compliance is a liability shield for the credit card companies, not an impenetrable fortress for merchants. By following the
PCI checklist, businesses can say they did their due diligence, but in the event of a breach, responsibility often shifts right back to the
merchant, who bears most of the financial and reputational damage.

Conclusion

Aling with a payment processor/agent that helps keep you PCI compliant and doesn't penalize you with egregious fees. While PCI
compliance is a framework to follow, it's not a silver bullet against data breaches. Business owners should be wary of viewing PCI as a
guarantee of security. Instead, consider it a baseline requirement and invest in advanced security measures that genuinely protect
customer data.

Jennifer -  Since you are on Vista it might make sense to look at Automatic Invoicing which is part of the Viewpoint Team (Trimble Construction One).    They developed
this a couple years back & still needs some enhancements (Viewpoint if you are monitoring this those are identify the SL (subcontract) numbers, Enter a
pay control within auto invoice that carries to the entry in Vista & only show active vendors in the vendor lookup in auto invoice).  Might
not be the perfect solution now but as part of he Vista/Viewpoint world you don't need to worry about integrations.

Take care...    Todd

Depending on the number of employees, running payroll parallel to ADP is not an issue. You said start up so I'm thinking a lower number of employees (fifty was
usually my baseline for paralleling down to the penny). Properly set up, you shouldn't have many net check differences. For those differences you could adjust each
check for the net to match or just do a cash management adjustment to get cash correct. The other way I used to do it was to have anything ADP pays flow through a
cash clearing account (withholding, employer taxes, child support) and then after processing payroll in Spectrum, do a cash management entry to credit the real cash
account, debit the clearing and payroll processing fees account. Payroll will still have actual costs and burden hitting appropriate jobs/GL accounts. If you are using
Traqspera for time collection, the timecards are sync'd with Spectrum and exported to ADP.

Of course, the method you choose should also take into consideration certified payroll reporting requirements and/or unions.

As the company grows, they might then want to do the payroll bridge with ADP. I think I calculated that 100+ employees was where I saw real time savings and benefits
as the connection fee was a one time hit.

If questions, please reach out.

I am working with a prospect who is going to use Spectrum for accounting and ADP for payroll. Can anyone offer best practices on how to do this? This is a startup and
they have already balked at $10,000 ADP wanted to build a template. Since ADP will have all PR data could journal entries be used to record activity from ADP payroll
journals? Client is wanting to actually set up payroll in Spectrum and process actual payrolls but print paper checks and reconcile to ADP. I don't think this is a good
idea but throwing it out there.

Hi Ron,

We're currently using Spectrum alongside a third-party payroll provider, and while there are several ways to approach this setup, I believe it's important to first consider
company size and any plans for continued growth. We're currently at 50 employees and growing, and the way I've been managing this process to date isn't sustainable
long-term. While Spectrum does offer full in-house payroll capabilities, managing all the associated compliance can be a significant undertaking. If you're not fully
prepared to take that on, a hybrid approach-leveraging Spectrum alongside a third-party payroll provider-can be an effective solution. That's ultimately the path we've
chosen for now.

Just for a bit of background, we went live in Spectrum in April 2023 and, at that time, were using Paylocity. As of April this year, we transitioned to BambooHR as our
third-party payroll provider, and we've been very happy with the level of service provided so far.

Here's how our current setup works:

Timekeeping:

We use Traqspera to track employee hours. Those hours are then imported into both Spectrum and BambooHR for payroll processing.

Payroll Processing:

We use the KBS connector to sync most employee data between BambooHR and Spectrum. However, benefit deduction data does not sync, which means I'm
manually maintaining those deductions in both systems-not ideal but previously we were having to manually manage ALL employee data between multiple systems,
so, this is progress for us personally.

Third-Party Payroll Role:

Once hours are imported into BambooHR:

They handle all gross-to-net calculations

Withhold deductions and taxes

Manage direct deposits

Generate employee paystubs

File all federal, state, and local taxes

Issue W-2s at year-end

After payroll is processed, the vendor pulls one consolidated payment from our bank that covers wages and taxes.

Spectrum Integration:

After running the pre-process register in BambooHR, I manually adjust each paycheck in Spectrum to match. This step ensures all appropriate GL accounts-including
payroll liabilities-are properly affected when payroll is posted in Spectrum. I then record an AP entry against those liabilities to reflect the payment made to our third-
party vendor.

While this method ensures accounting accuracy, manually adjusting each paycheck is not scalable as our workforce grows. I'm reaching a point where I need to move
away from matching everything to the penny and accept a manageable level of variance between the two systems.

That said, we plan to work closely with our KBS consultant and BambooHR to identify a more sustainable approach-ideally using a combination of Spectrum's payroll
module and GL entries to maintain accuracy while minimizing the need for manual intervention.

If your customer isn't fully committed to ADP and is open to exploring alternatives like BambooHR, I'd be happy to connect you with my consultant. His connector tool
has proven to be both highly valuable and extremely cost-effective for us.

That said, when we were evaluating options to move away from our previous third-party provider, I explored several solutions. If your client's primary need is simply for
someone to handle payroll tax filings, there's a tool called Aatrix that was recommended to me by a few Trimble contacts. It focuses specifically on that function and
could be a good fit depending on their needs.

Re: Waiver and Compliance Training

I would absolutely love this!

As a supplier, I'm on the verify and sign-your-rights-away side, and I receive many incorrect waivers that I'm expected to sign.  When the waiver doesn't match, I have
to go back and forth with my customer as to what numbers and dates can be used on the conditional and unconditional waivers.  It can be an unnecessarily long
process, and occasionally uncomfortable.  Knowledge and training on this would shorten turn-around time considerably.

One example I keep seeing: an unconditional waiver, that someone expects me to sign, covering a specific dollar amount though say May 31st, but it's only May 9th!
There is no way I can even verify what that customer will be purchasing in the month, must less attest that the customer paid for it.

I'd like to see the supplier-side view represented in the training.  I often hear, "I just need it signed so I can get paid."  Valid, but please understand that the supplier is
signing away legal rights to the security they have in the project and may have to navigate indemnity clauses written in thick legalese that no insurance company wants
them to agreeing to.  Just signing something can have some real consequences.  (Aside from knowingly signing a false legal document is perjury, or so I've heard, I'm
not a lawyer).

Thanks for letting me have a moment.

Love seeing this interest-it's such an important topic for finance and compliance teams in construction, and one that doesn't always get the structured training it
deserves.

If it's helpful, I'd be happy to coordinate a free Zoom workshop tailored for your teams with CFMA. I think we can walk through best practices for lien waivers, COIs, and
overall compliance workflows-specific to the tools and processes you already use (e.g., Procore, Viewpoint, Sage, etc.).

We'd also be glad to invite a few fellow CFMA members who've worked on these challenges firsthand to share what's worked for them. Our goal is to keep it practical
and collaborative-more of a "working session" with free resources after than a lecture.

If that sounds useful, just let me know and we'll get something scheduled that works for your teams.

Hi Sharon,

That's a really thoughtful question - and you're right to be looking at how to keep your confidential forecasting and project data protected while using AI. Here's a quick
breakdown to help clarify some of what's involved:

 What is AI inference hardware?

Inference hardware is the specialized compute equipment that runs AI models (like GPT-4) in production - meaning, it processes your inputs and generates outputs.
This is different from training a model, which is even more resource-intensive.

Common inference hardware includes:

GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) - like NVIDIA A100, H100, or L40S.

ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) - e.g., Google's TPUs.

FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) - less common for LLMs but used in some niche workloads.

Edge AI Chips - for smaller models running on mobile or IoT devices.

Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 almost always run on powerful datacenter GPUs such as the A100 or H100.

 Is inference hardware expensive?



---

 Is inference hardware expensive?

 Yes - very! Here's a rough idea:

NVIDIA A100 80GB: ~$25,000–$35,000 per GPU.

NVIDIA H100: ~$35,000–$45,000 per GPU.

And you usually need multiple GPUs (often clusters of tens or even hundreds) to run high-throughput, low-latency workloads.

Plus:

You'll need the right servers, racks, power, and cooling.

You'll need to manage the software stack (CUDA drivers, orchestration).

Total cost of ownership can run into the millions for large-scale enterprise inference.

 How easy is it to run this on-prem?

 Technically possible, but complex in practice:

You need to buy and install the hardware - which is in high demand.

You need a data center space with enough power and cooling capacity.

You need skilled IT staff to deploy, monitor, and maintain it.

For smaller AI models (like a 7B–13B parameter open-source LLM), some companies do run inference on-prem, but for a GPT-4-class model, it's extremely
rare for companies outside the big tech cloud providers to host their own inference.

 Why do most companies use the cloud instead?

Most organizations use cloud AI because:

You don't need to pay upfront for expensive hardware.

You get flexible, on-demand scaling.

You don't need a big internal ML Ops team to keep things running smoothly.

Providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Cohere handle the infrastructure headaches for you.

 One practical challenge in construction

Many construction IT teams simply haven't had the training yet to deploy or maintain these models on-premises - or to run the required GPU clusters efficiently and
securely. So even when privacy is a top concern, the cost, staffing, and datacenter requirements can make on-prem AI much more challenging than it seems at first.

TL;DR:

 Keeping AI "behind the firewall" is a smart goal - but doing so for large models like GPT-4 is technically complex, expensive, and rare.

 For most companies, a mix of secure cloud services plus strict data governance is the practical path forward.

 Smaller, open-source models can sometimes be run in your own environment with the right hardware and skills.

Really interested to hear how others in our industry are thinking about this too - and I think it's a great topic for the 2026 conference!

Best,
Rishi

I've been looking into a few AI tools to support contract review and negotiation workflows.

One that came up recently for me is FirstRule. Has anyone demo'd or implemented FirstRule? Would love to hear if it's been helpful. Do you trust it to streamline
internal review? Also curious if not FirstRule, what are you using that's actually saved you time? I demoed Spellbook recently. To be honest, I wasn't super impressed.
It's basically a ChatGPT-4 wrapper that lives in Word. Also, if I can get ChatGPT Pro for cheaper in the browser with more features, it didn't feel like something worth
paying extra for.

Would love to hear from anyone who's gone further down the path, what's actually worked for you? Which tools have saved real time or caught issues before legal got
involved?

Thanks in advance, would be great to hear what's working (or not working) out there.

Hello, I have inquired about COI Tracking software before and took the advice of someone to ask my insurance agent about what they offer to track at no cost.  This
avenue doesn't seem to fit what we really need which is a shame because it was at not cost.

Now I am meeting with companies to see who I may want to pay to use and the first one I met with is Jones.  It works with Procore which is great and looks like
something we would want to use.  Then there is the cost.  It is $12,000 annually with an implementation fee in the first year to make it around $14K the first year.

Does anyone use anything similar that is more cost effective?  Or is this pretty much the cost for similar products?

Thank you,

We are using our Insurance Broker IMA.  They have a stand-alone division that tracks all of our COI's per project or globally for certain subcontractors.  IMACC tracks
all COI's and analyses what a subcontractor needs to carry for coverage.  If need be IMACC will contact the subcontractors insurance broker directly to resolve.
IMACC analyses the insurance requirements we have with the owner as well as reading the subcontractors agreement.  We have been very happy with this product
and the cost is about $10,000 per year.  Feel free to call me if you would like more information.

Subject: COI Tracking & Compliance Software

Hello, I have inquired about COI Tracking software before and took the advice of someone to ask my insurance agent about what they offer to track at no cost.  This
avenue doesn't seem to fit what we really need which is a shame because it was at not cost.

Now I am meeting with companies to see who I may want to pay to use and the first one I met with is Jones.  It works with Procore which is great and looks like
something we would want to use.  Then there is the cost.  It is $12,000 annually with an implementation fee in the first year to make it around $14K the first year.

Does anyone use anything similar that is more cost effective?  Or is this pretty much the cost for similar products?

Thank you,

Shanda

Hey Shanda - we've seen a number of CFMA members switch to Billy (billyforinsurance.com/solutions/self-service) and be really happy with the experience. It's
reasonably priced, integrates with Procore, and does more than just track COIs. You can also manage W9s, endorsements, and even automate reminders.

They offer a free trial, and what stood out to me at CFMA National was how much they prioritize relationships and customer feedback. Definitely worth a look if you're
evaluating options!

Happy to connect you if helpful.

We transitioned to Vista and ProjectSight at the beginning of 2024. We utilize the TC1 automatic invoicing, it certainly was an upgrade from hand inputting. It is not
perfect - a trust but verify situation but that is how I would treat AI anyways. They are actively upgrading the software as well. We are pleased with projectsight. Still
waiting for cost projections to be initiated through PS and push to vista. Also waiting for Owner Change Orders to originate in ProjectSight and push to Vista. Trimble
has stated those should be released by the end of the year.

We switched over to Finvari in October of last year.  We also use Foundation and we could not be happier!  I've rolled several techy processes out to field personnel
over the last 20 years and none have gone as easily as this.  We have 40-50 cardholders and every one of them love the change.  Once you swipe, you get an almost
instantaneous notification to your phone to take a picture of the receipt and to code your transaction.  The app interface on the user side is very simple and inputs in
logical order so the guys don't have to think too hard.  We get to control which jobs, phases, cost codes, and classes appear for them to choose from.  We have opted
for two layers of approval on each transaction before it hits our books for quality control.  We get instant notifications when someone swipes and gets declined.
Updates to spend limits are instant and can be done by an administrator on their phone if required after hours, on weekends, at lunch, or sitting by the pool.  The spend
categories are simple and effective.  There is even a function to send an invoice back to an employee if they charge something personal in error that they can pay
electronically.  No more payroll deducts for silly mistakes.  Foundation's FSI importer makes quick work of importing weekly.  The drill-down function in Foundation's
Executive Dashboard will actually take you all the way to the picture of the receipt which is very nice.  We started with paper receipts and handwritten expense reports
then went to Concur and things were still very time consuming and there was no cost control built in.  My administrator went from spending at least an hour EVERY day
coding transactions, tracking down receipts, hounding foremen for info, etc. to now taking maybe 30 minutes each WEEK to wrap up a cycle and import into
Foundation.  We actually eliminated a position because this particular workload disappeared.  Implementation was a breeze and the entire Finvari team has been very
responsive and great to work with.  I have nothing but great things to say about Finvari and I highly recommend their services to anyone/everyone.  The software is as
good as they make it look in the demo.

We set out about 5 years ago to address what we percieved as a major use case for CFO's, Controllers and finance teams in construction - Better more reliable and
dynamic certainty of future portfolio financial outcomes.  The idea is that if we can use exisitng company data to empower finance teams then that helps them make
manage fincial factors such as portfolio profit forecasting, revenues, cash flows etc.

Just for the record this is not an LLM or an AI agent or a deeplearner.  It can be described as an ensemble methods supervised machine learning algorithm.  But that
doesn't matter to anyone except AI specialists; what matters is what it does and how that can help.

That is a great question, thank you for starting the conversation.

To build on your topic, I would love to hear specifically from our specialty trade members:

What AI tools or programs are you currently using in your company or role, and what tools are you not yet using but are interested in learning more about?

We are currently evaluating AI Vendor selection as a potential topic for the specialty trade track at the 2026 CFMA Conference, and your feedback would be incredibly
helpful in determining how relevant and practical this would be for our group.

Whether you are experimenting with tools such as Microsoft Copilot, ChatGPT, or industry-specific solutions, or are simply exploring how AI might support functions like
estimating, forecasting, document review, or others, we would truly appreciate your input.

Thank you in advance.

Given the interest in this topic, we're planning to run a free training session on how to run AI models locally using Ollama - an open-source framework that
simplifies running large language models (LLMs) right on your own servers or workstations, securely behind your firewall. This approach helps ensure your confidential
project data stays entirely within your network and doesn't feed into any public models.

What is Ollama?
Ollama is open-source software that makes it much easier to download, manage, and interact with various LLMs - including popular open-source models like Llama 2,
Mistral, and Gemma - directly on your machines. This gives you greater control over your data and removes the need to rely on external, cloud-based AI services.

Here's a quick breakdown of what Ollama offers:

Local Execution: Run LLMs directly on your computer for more control over data and potentially faster performance.

Model Management: Easily download, manage, and switch between different open-source models.

Open Source Focus: Fosters transparency, flexibility, and customization.

Simplified Workflow: Designed to simplify the process of using LLMs, making it accessible for teams to experiment and build.

Command-Line and GUI Options: Supports both command-line use and third-party GUI tools like Open WebUI for a more user-friendly experience.

Why use Ollama?

Privacy and Data Control: Keep your confidential data fully inside your network.

Reduced Latency: Local execution means you can see results faster.

Cost Savings: There's no cost for using the open-source models themselves - so you avoid ongoing vendor fees.

Flexibility and Customization: Try different models and tailor them for forecasting, scheduling, or other use cases.

Community and Open Source: Ollama is backed by an open-source community encouraging collaboration and innovation.

During this training session, attendees won't have to run anything on their own computers - you'll be able to watch a step-by-step walkthrough of how to get
started, what the hardware and security requirements look like, and what to expect in practice.



---

started, what the hardware and security requirements look like, and what to expect in practice.

We'll also cover some practical limitations:

Model size: Bigger, more capable models need more computing power, so there's a trade-off between performance and hardware cost.

Context length: Local models often can't handle as much information at once as large cloud services.

Domain tuning: You may need to fine-tune or adjust prompts to get the most accurate forecasts for your projects.

Our goal is to give Construction Finance and IT professionals a clear, realistic starting point for testing AI securely behind your firewall, with no risk of your
proprietary data ending up in someone else's model.

If this training session sounds valuable for you or your team, let me know - I'd love to hear who would benefit!

To ensure that your data remains secure and does not leave your internal environment, the most effective approach is to download and host the AI model weights
locally-either on your on-premise servers or within a private cloud infrastructure behind your firewall. This setup allows all data processing and model training to occur
within your controlled environment, ensuring confidentiality and compliance with internal security policies.

Using external APIs from providers such as OpenAI, or similar services carries the inherent risk of data exposure, as data must be transmitted externally. Even with
strong privacy policies, this could potentially lead to information leakage or misuse if not carefully managed.

By deploying the model locally, you maintain full control over the data lifecycle and eliminate the risk of unintended data sharing or external model training using your
proprietary information. This is the most secure and scalable solution for organizations working with sensitive or high-value operational data.

That works of course but has challenges for product upgrades and retraining, especially if its a learning model that can make financial predictions (ie not an LLM or
deeplearning model which have not been able to reliably forecast  financial outcomes).  Another way to deal with financial data that we use with government data, is for
the user to deploy an annonymisation program (on their side of the fire wall) before the data goes to the cloud, and then reverse the process when the predictions
come back.  This is not new, its used frequently in applications like medical research and defence and so on.

We are using our Insurance Broker IMA.  They have a stand-alone division that tracks all of our COI's per project or globally for certain subcontractors.  IMACC tracks
all COI's and analyses what a subcontractor needs to carry for coverage.  If need be IMACC will contact the subcontractors insurance broker directly to resolve.
IMACC analyses the insurance requirements we have with the owner as well as reading the subcontractors agreement.  We have been very happy with this product
and the cost is about $10,000 per year.  Feel free to call me if you would like more information.

I was wondering if there are any training seminars or certifications regarding Lien Waivers and compliance that anyone can recommend. I was hoping to get my team
more well rounded in this area.

Thanks!

I'd like to have a brief clip I could send our subcontractors!  We use Trimble Pay, so most of our lien waivers are prefilled.  But sometimes we have to get lower tier
waivers or have to use a form that our client requires that can't be prefilled.  We spend w-a-y too much time rejecting pay apps because the lien waivers are wrong, or
the lower tiers are incomplete.

I am an associate member of the CFMA. I consult in the construction industry working with founder owned businesses $50MM in total revenue or less.

I just completed an ERP review for a site work contractor and they chose NetSuite for accounting and project management and added Miter on for
payroll/timekeeping/expense control.

If you would like my contact at NetSuite, her name is Hannah Mecke and she is really dedicated to her job.

If you need any insight into your current role, like a kickstart to achieve next level results. Please reach out.

Hello,

I recently stepped into a new role at a growing construction company with projected annual revenue between $25M–$40M. We're currently in the process of designing
our financial reporting framework, internal control structure, and evaluating software integrations to streamline operations.

At present, we use QuickBooks Online (QBO) for accounting and Procore for project management. Our goal is to better integrate these systems-creating a more
cohesive platform where we can oversee project budgeting, profitability, and cash flow in real time. Ideally, we'd like a unified solution that connects project
management with finance to enhance visibility and decision-making.

I'd love to hear what ERP or financial management tools you've found effective-especially if you've worked in construction or a similarly complex project-based
environment. Your insights would be greatly appreciated as we evaluate next steps.

Thank you in advance!

Best regards,

I am curious how companies are structuring their advertising budget? Are you using an arbitrary dollar amount, a % of revenue, or something else? Also I am curious
what avenues companies are focusing their budgets on whether is be print, website design/updating, social media, photo & video content, events, sponsorships, or
some mix of all types?  I am trying to keep management's focus on "best bang for your buck" and focusing on what is relevant and actually produces exposure from the
correct audience. I would appreciate your thoughts on what your teams have done that you have liked or felt had good value.

We are almost as bad, but we cut out two steps.  We created the excel spreadsheet in a format that we can import straight into our ERP.  It is pre-populated with
employee names and cost codes.  The foreman in the field keys in the data each day and emails the excel file once a week.  We send back a new file each week with
changes in personnel or pay rates.

We've been trying to improve on it for years, but we have not found an easier process yet.

We recently helped a utility construction firm that used a fully manual process for timesheets:

1.  Paper filled on site

2.  Scanned and emailed

3.  Manually validated in Excel

4.  Then keyed into the ERP

It created delays, errors, and took 1–2 full-time staff just to keep up. Is this something other construction or field-service companies are still dealing with? Curious how
others are handling it?

Take a look at CrewTracks - people can clock in & out on their phones or tablets, everything can be job costed, daill reports, job site photoes, etc can all be captured
with CrewTracks. It uploads directly into your ERP everyday & can be approved or not approved - depends on how you set it up. It is easy to set up, easy to use &
made life A WHOLE LOT easier for us!! I can get you a contact number if you want to take a look at it.

B2W Track is what we use. It creates daily logs, tracks equipment, attaches photos, and a lot of other things. Might be overkill for now if this firm is still on paper
timecards, but a lot of 3rd party timekeeping tools out there have the ability to export to an Excel file for import. If the client's having this much of a bottleneck with data
entry in payroll, it might be worth pushing them to evaluate their software use (if they are using something that supports timecard imports currently) or begin
researching a construction-specific ERP option so they can add job costing, service management, whatever they need, that has better workflows for their company. At
the very least it will give them something that can plan for in the future.

There are a lot of options for time capture and some sort of document capture. Depending on the ERP you are using may dictate the product that works the best. We
are a Sage 300 user and use Sage Service Operations (SSO) for time capture and reports for our service side. We are moving from eSub to Procore on our
construction side for time and project management. There are many other options as well, Build Ops, Service Titan, HH2, Workforce Go,

My client is in the same boat, QBO & Procore.  We use Smoothlink to integrate the data and it works fairly well.  The problem is QBO is just not adequate for
construction.  After an exhaustive search, we settled on Foundation.  We hoped to use Foundations Project HQ to replace Procore, but it lacks the established
workflows we have set up in Procore.

We are not thrilled with Foundations integration tool, but we can make it work.  We looked at Agave, but found it too expensive.

Congratulations on your new role! Given your company's growth and the need for a unified financial and project management platform, I highly recommend considering
Sage Intacct Construction. It's a true cloud-based ERP solution purpose-built for the construction industry, offering robust financial management, real-time project
insights, and seamless integration with leading applications like Procore.

A key advantage is that Sage Intacct's construction module is built on the foundation of Sage's industry-leading Timberline software (Sage 300 CRE), which has
been a trusted name in construction accounting for decades. Rather than simply retooling Timberline, Sage Intacct Construction leverages decades of best practices to
deliver a modern, cloud-native solution that addresses today's construction and real estate challenges. This means you get advanced job costing, automated WIP
management, and multi-entity support-all with the flexibility and accessibility of the cloud.

Dean Dorton has been a leading Sage Intacct partner since 2011 with deep expertise in construction and real estate. We can help you evaluate, implement, and
optimize Sage Intacct to fit your company's unique needs, ensuring you maximize ROI and streamline your operations. Our team can guide you through every step,
from initial assessment to integration and ongoing support.

If you'd like to discuss your requirements in more detail or see a tailored demo, please let me know using the contact information in my signature or replying here. I'd be
delighted to help.

While it's not an ERP, I'd definitely recommend checking out Clearstory for managing Change Orders and T&M workflows. It plugs into platforms like Procore and gives
you real-time visibility into pending costs, which is a huge help when you're trying to improve forecasting and protect margin.

Hello,

I recently stepped into a new role at a growing construction company with projected annual revenue between $25M–$40M. We're currently in the process of designing
our financial reporting framework, internal control structure, and evaluating software integrations to streamline operations.

At present, we use QuickBooks Online (QBO) for accounting and Procore for project management. Our goal is to better integrate these systems-creating a more
cohesive platform where we can oversee project budgeting, profitability, and cash flow in real time. Ideally, we'd like a unified solution that connects project
management with finance to enhance visibility and decision-making.

I'd love to hear what ERP or financial management tools you've found effective-especially if you've worked in construction or a similarly complex project-based
environment. Your insights would be greatly appreciated as we evaluate next steps.

We use Miter and are able to job cost everything. Your implementation manager will go over how to do it. There is an accounting section of Miter where you map
everything. It does take some trial and error. I recommend doing a ghost payroll before you go live, where you enter a prior weeks payroll info into Miter. Then compare
the posting logs from Sage to the export of Miter, to see if it is exporting everything the way you want it to.

Hi everyone,

We're looking to strengthen our team's skills in Foundation Construction Accounting Software. Does anyone have recommendations for third-party training
professionals or certified Foundation Professionals that you've had a good experience with? We operate in New Jersey. Any insight on individuals or firms who provide
effective hands-on training outside of what Foundation offers would be greatly appreciated. It seems Foundation trainers are very busy and cannot accommodate more
than a short twice/week training session for us.

Thanks in advance for your help.

We did develop a Project-Level Cash Flow training program with support from ELECTRI-International and CFMA. And we also developed an advanced Managerial
Accounting for Construction Managers training program as well. Both are one-day, in-person courses. And both are intended for operations team (though some early-
career CFM's would benefit from learning the context). We are in the process of developing some short YouTube video segments that can be used during a lunch-and-
learn setting.

The Cash Flow training course includes a chapter on learning to use the WIP report, the construction payment cycle, under/over-billings, equity vs debt financing,
leveraging trade discounts, profit/margin fade, and many other important principles.

I'm a big fan of education, and I'm a bigger fan of learning! So please let me know if I can help,

We are using Corpay as well.  We are testing Finvari on a limited basis and overall I feel like it works great.  Comdata has the direct connection to Vista and Fivari has
a similar .csv import capability.  Finvari's system does everything on a transaction basis so as soon as one transaction is coded and approved it is complete where
Corpay does expense reports in batches so we find ourself waiting longer before we import.  The major pro we like about Finvari is the Vista JC Detail can show better
info.  The Description field still says Comdata or Finvari but Finvari can customize the Reference field to show part of the actual vendor name (up to 15 characters I
believe).  Instead if just having a random Reference, our JC detail Reference now says "Home Depot" or whoever the vendor is.

We have been on the Corpay (formerly ComData) card for several years - we have 400 cards and utilize the app for receipt capture etc.  Everyone is so excited about
Finvari - is it any different from Corpay Expense Track?  Does it integrate with Vista better/differently than Corpay?

We switched over from Corpay last month and use Vista. We had a lot of problems with Corpay and Vista. Something broke in the link between the two so whenever
we added new phase codes or jobs I would need to log into our Vista Server and from there access the ExpenseTrack setup and manually sync the data. Corpay also
did not like that we change GL account names sometimes. We have a GL code for each vehicle and when we move vehicles around to different employees, we change
the name on the GL account rather than create a whole new account. Corpay can't handle that so I need to go into the ExpenseTrack settings GL integrations and
check the box to include the new (named) GL account, then I need to open a notepad that has all the accounts on it. When we change the GL account name, the
notepad now has 2 of the accounts (1 with the old name and 1 with the new name). I have to delete the line item that has the old name. I have to be very careful with
the data in that notepad that I don't screw it up because I was told that if I messed something up in there it would royally mess up all of our Comdata stuff. I don't
understand all of that because we originally had an IT guy who handled all of that and he just showed me what to do when he left.

With Finvari I just log into the website to manually sync (if needed) and it's much faster than logging into a remote server. Finvari also automatically pulls all the new job
and GL account information without any problems. When we code an expense to a job, the Project Manager automatically receives that expense to approve and that
pulls from Viewpoint job setup. Our PM's love that because they see every expense that will be hitting their job. With Corpay they only saw the expenses that their
Supers were putting to the job (prior to the expenses being posted on a monthly basis). If marketing is planning a ribbon cutting and coding to their job then the PM will
be the one to approve that charge now. Overall it's just working much more seamlessly and we are posting credit cards every week. With Corpay we had to get
everyone to submit their expense reports after the month ends, then get them all approved and it was usually the 15th of the month before we were able to post the
charges from the previous month.

We too are a Mechanical contractor (although on a much smaller scale) and we have the same issue with being relationship based with field personnel who don't have
a WFH option.  We moved to a hybrid approach where everyone is in the office a minimum of 3 days a week.  We laid out the tasking that we always have to have the
ability to cover in the office each day by Accounting and staggered the staffing days in/out so that someone is here each day to cover any task.  You days each week
are the same and everyone is in on Tuesdays so we all are here one day a week.  We also made it that if there is a meeting you need to be at on one of your
"scheuduled" WFH day, too bad and you need to come in the office for the meeting.  We aren't going to try to run the business from "who is in the office what days".
We also try to make sure if you do need to be at home on one of your normal office days, you flip days that week so you in the office on one of your WFH days so you
are still in here 3 days a week.

Not perfect, but it has worked to allow that WFH along with the be in the office.

Good luck with whatever you decide.

I used to work for a company that sold AI phone agents.  It is becoming more popular now and these AI agents can do quite a bit.  Also 95% of people surveyed did not know they were speaking with an AI agents.

Scheduling, customer support and basic questions are most common uses.  But basically, anything that you can "train" for.  So if you have consistent answers to questions, and not opinioned thought questions then an AI agent can help.  If you have any questions, feel free to reach out and I would be happy to go over it in more detail.

Hi Karen,

I've been integrating AI into my workflows to enhance efficiency and streamline key processes:

Document Summarization & Data Extraction: I regularly use AI to digest large volumes of information from contracts, agreements, and other documents, quickly distilling key points and translating that information into Excel summaries for clearer analysis and reporting.

Email Drafting & Communication Support: Based on these summaries, I formulate clear, targeted email responses, improving communication speed and accuracy across departments and with external stakeholders.

Standard Operating Procedures & Training: I've utilized AI to help draft and refine SOPs and create training materials tailored to specific roles and responsibilities, facilitating more effective onboarding and knowledge sharing.

Forms & Application Guidance: AI has served as a reliable assistant in completing permit and license forms, as well as drafting step-by-step instructions for staff tasked with similar applications.

Bank Reconciliation Support: I also apply AI to review bank reconciliations, identifying anomalies such as duplicate payments or long-outstanding checks, which allows for timely corrective action and cleaner month-end closes.

Overall, I consistently look for innovative ways to optimize workflows and reclaim time for higher-level financial review and strategic oversight.

Best regards,
Patricia Romero

That is a great question, thank you for starting the conversation.

To build on your topic, I would love to hear specifically from our specialty trade members:

What AI tools or programs are you currently using in your company or role, and what tools are you not yet using but are interested in learning more about?

We are currently evaluating AI Vendor selection as a potential topic for the specialty trade track at the 2026 CFMA Conference, and your feedback would be incredibly helpful in determining how relevant and practical this would be for our group.

These are following usecases I have seen using AI agents
1. Document processing- Invoices, remittance, contracts scan, extract and validate
2. Automate paper based timesheets using AI- scanning and loading to ERPs
3. Account & Bank Reconciliation
4. Analytics - Ask any analytics question on the data

Etc.

If you need to discuss AI , happy to jump in

Hello,

I'm the Financial Controller for a specialty contractor in New York City that focuses on concrete and masonry work. I regularly use ChatGPT Accounting Solver to support a wide range of functions that enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and integrity of our financial operations:

Internal Controls & SOP Development: I use ChatGPT to assist in the creation and refinement of internal controls, detailed process flows, and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that align with both field activities and office workflows.

Bank Reconciliation Support: ChatGPT plays a key role in my monthly bank reconciliation review-identifying anomalies such as duplicate payments or long-outstanding checks that require resolution, improving the accuracy and timeliness of our financial closes.

Payroll Reconciliation: I use it to summarize and structure data from our third-party payroll provider, supporting the reconciliation process between external payroll reports and our internal books and records-helping ensure completeness and compliance.

Data Consolidation & Reporting: I also rely on ChatGPT to develop customized spreadsheets that consolidate data from multiple sources. These tools streamline reporting, support audit readiness, and help visualize trends for leadership and project managers.

Operational Documentation & Staff Guidance: Whether drafting permit and license forms or preparing training guides for staff, ChatGPT assists in generating step-by-step instructions that improve consistency and reduce administrative overhead.

ChatGPT Accounting Solver has become a great tool in my work-freeing up time for more strategic financial review while helping me implement better systems, controls, and documentation across the board.

Best regards,

How do you manage timesheets from field sites?

Jul 2, 2025 2:19 PM

Ashok Manthena

We recently helped a utility construction firm that used a fully manual process for timesheets:

1.  Paper filled on site

2.  Scanned and emailed

3.  Manually validated in Excel

4.  Then keyed into the ERP

It created delays, errors, and took 1–2 full-time staff just to keep up. Is this something other construction or field-service companies are still dealing with? Curious how
others are handling it?

I recently stepped into a new role at a growing construction company with projected annual revenue between $25M–$40M. We're currently in the process of designing
our financial reporting framework, internal control structure, and evaluating software integrations to streamline operations.

At present, we use QuickBooks Online (QBO) for accounting and Procore for project management. Our goal is to better integrate these systems-creating a more
cohesive platform where we can oversee project budgeting, profitability, and cash flow in real time. Ideally, we'd like a unified solution that connects project
management with finance to enhance visibility and decision-making.

I'd love to hear what ERP or financial management tools you've found effective-especially if you've worked in construction or a similarly complex project-based
environment. Your insights would be greatly appreciated as we evaluate next steps.

Thank you in advance!

Hi Patricia,

Congratulations on your new role! There are several ERP options available that could be a good fit for your new company, and I would recommend shopping around to
determine the best fit for your specific needs.

At Cano Consulting we provide implementations and consulting for users of Spectrum, one of Trimble's ERPs that is intended for businesses around your size. Our
founder, Steve Cano, was a Spectrum user and now has over 18 years of experience with the software.

Spectrum should absolutely be among the ERPs you consider, and we would be happy to answer any questions you have about the software. Please let me know if
you'd like to set up a call.

Thank you,

professionals or certified Foundation Professionals that you've had a good experience with? We operate in New Jersey. Any insight on individuals or firms who provide
effective hands-on training outside of what Foundation offers would be greatly appreciated. It seems Foundation trainers are very busy and cannot accommodate more

We use Foundation as our ERP and a little more than a year ago we were wondering the same question. We eventually went with Finvari and couldn't be happier. You
do have to export from their system and import into Foundation, but it is a simple and easy process. I highly recommend you look into Finvari to see if it fits what you
are looking for.

As an employee for Sage, I have been attending the TUG conference for over 20 years.  I always receive positive feedback from attendees pertaining to the session
content as well as the network opportunities.  I retired from Sage in May of this year and still planning to attend.  I am doing numerous session in the Sage Intacct
Construction training track.  The majority of the track is targeted at Sage 300 CRE.  I think you will find entry level sessions as well as more advanced sessions as
well.

The ISV Sage partners are going to be present as well.  Looks like they will have close to 40 companies representing their integrated product.  Good opportunity to
round out your tech stack.

Drop me a direct note if you have any specific questions.

Hope all is well.  I have a number of slides in my different presentations which focus on the Project Management Lifecycle.  I drill down on actions that the different
stakeholders (Estimating, PM's and Accounting) can take during each phase.  I also have some basic examples with under(over) billing slides that look at how to
analyze these in conjunction with the WIP.

So I don't have a full presentation but can share some of these slides with you if that would help.  Just let me know.

Thanks, --Rich

I am an ERP consultant for the construction industry and saw your post about IFS. We are not a VAR for IFS or a reseller, so no interest in their company or product.
But I have needed better choices for our clients when selecting ERP. IFS caught our eye some five to seven years ago and impressed our team, more on the tech side
than functionally. But the functionality has caught up pretty well over that time period. Large union payroll process was an issue.

We are working with one large GC who is implementing IFS now (going well) with a number of integrations. We are going to help a large mechanical contractor get
their IFS implementation optimized. We have another client we worked with last year that is still on Apps10 and waiting to implement Cloud. Another large mechanical
has deployed IFS successfully and are now considering optimizing within the organization. We helped a large mechanical with a selection earlier this year and IFS was
on the short-list. Made it to the short-short list. Decision pending. But functionally, good fit. Issues with dispatching though in Service.

IFS is getting traction in the industry just not as quickly as they would like. I am cautiously optimistic since they are pouring considerable effort and investment into the
product for construction. I will say the implementation partner is key to success. They are not all equal and some don't know construction all that well.

Hope this is helpful.

We just transitioned to Vista last June and have since implemented Unanet for our CRM.  We are now in the process of implementing Project Sight for Project
Management.  I was hoping to find others who also use Vista and Project Sight and/or Unanet.  I would love to know best practices and things to watch out for!

Also, any Vista users successfully implement AI for their AP?  We have high volume and are just starting down the path of looking at what Vista and others can do to
help automate AP.

Thanks all!

I am working with a prospect who is going to use Spectrum for accounting and ADP for payroll. Can anyone offer best practices on how to do this? This is a startup and
they have already balked at $10,000 ADP wanted to build a template. Since ADP will have all PR data could journal entries be used to record activity from ADP payroll
journals? Client is wanting to actually set up payroll in Spectrum and process actual payrolls but print paper checks and reconcile to ADP. I don't think this is a good
idea but throwing it out there.

Love seeing this interest-it's such an important topic for finance and compliance teams in construction, and one that doesn't always get the structured training it
deserves.

If it's helpful, I'd be happy to coordinate a free Zoom workshop tailored for your teams with CFMA. I think we can walk through best practices for lien waivers, COIs, and
overall compliance workflows-specific to the tools and processes you already use (e.g., Procore, Viewpoint, Sage, etc.).

We'd also be glad to invite a few fellow CFMA members who've worked on these challenges firsthand to share what's worked for them. Our goal is to keep it practical
and collaborative-more of a "working session" with free resources after than a lecture.

If that sounds useful, just let me know and we'll get something scheduled that works for your teams.

We are a Vista customer using FM Mobile Timekeeping app at the foreman level that gets submitted to FM Field Timesheet in the Portal for Job Time Approval. As
soon as the daily time is submitted the Payroll Timecard Entry is updated along with changes made in Job Time Approval in the portal. One connected system, real
time, with accurate clocks. Working through some reporting outputs in SSRS, Power BI, etc. but real time data without imports and manipulation is the way to go.

We moved from paper time sheets to Assignar three years ago and I highly recommend it.  Assignar has great scheduling capabilities, including the ability to set-up
detailed employee and equipment qualifications, which can be linked with specific types of work.  Jobs and work orders can be set-up so the system will prioritize the
employees and equipment that are qualified for that specific type of work.

The system sends alerts to employees with their field assignment.  The schedular is notified that the employee has received and confirmed their assignment and then
their foreman completes time cards for their crew each day via a mobile app.  We then import this data directly into Sage 300.

Congrats on the new role-and thank you for such a thoughtful post. You're thinking ahead in terms of how to align finance and operations, which is critical at the stage
you're in.

Have you looked into Procore's QuickBooks Connector? It could be a significant next step as you build toward real-time visibility. The connector helps synchronize key
financial data, such as contracts, budgets, invoicing, and direct costs, between Procore and QuickBooks Online, providing you with much of the foundational
information needed to generate accurate cash flow reports directly from project activity.

From there, Procore Pay can take it a step further-automating vendor payments while keeping them connected to real-time compliance and project statuses. It's a
powerful way to reduce friction with vendors and modernize the back office. To support this kind of workflow, a growing number of CFMA members who use Procore
are leveraging the Procore App Marketplace to bring in tools like Billy . Clearstory and many more

One area where teams often discuss at CFMA events is issues surrounding key documents that can be a pain to manage, but if not
handled properly, could result in catastrophic loss for your company. Think of things like Vendor Prequalification, Contracts, vendor
insurance and endorsements, OSHA Training, etc., as being collected and verified before contracts are issued and payments are made.

That's where systems like Billy, ClearStory, Siteline, fill in the gaps. For month end close outs - Rishi a CFMA member has built a fantastic solution that will save you so
much time for reconciliation.

Wishing you the best as you build your framework!

Hello,

   Reply to Group Online     View Thread     Recommend     Forward

I recently stepped into a new role at a growing construction company with projected annual revenue between $25M–$40M. We're currently in the process of designing
our financial reporting framework, internal control structure, and evaluating software integrations to streamline operations.

At present, we use QuickBooks Online (QBO) for accounting and Procore for project management. Our goal is to better integrate these systems-creating a more
cohesive platform where we can oversee project budgeting, profitability, and cash flow in real time. Ideally, we'd like a unified solution that connects project
management with finance to enhance visibility and decision-making.

I'd love to hear what ERP or financial management tools you've found effective-especially if you've worked in construction or a similarly complex project-based
environment. Your insights would be greatly appreciated as we evaluate next steps.

Thank you in advance!

We are a Vista/Team customer of 10 years and have recently purchased ProjectSight. We're kicking off our implementation today, but what I've seen so far, I'm
impressed with. Team is definitely lacking in features/integrations and in my opinion Trimble is focusing their efforts on ProjectSight so I felt it was a matter of time
before we needed to change to get more features. It does seem similar to Procore, and I wouldn't see a need to continue with both. Right now ProjectSight can push
PCOs, Subcontracts, Purchase Orders, and Sub CO/PO COs to Vista.

I've just poked around our demo environment and there is a lot more control over security, etc. I think we will be happy we made the move from Team. Sorry I don't
have more information since we're just getting started, but happy to keep you posted. I will also say that it seems like full integration and features of the Vista products
is dependent on being on the cloud with SSO. We also made that change last year anticipating that.

I used to work for a company that sold AI phone agents.  It is becoming more popular now and these AI agents can do quite a bit.  Also 95% of people surveyed did not
know they were speaking with an AI agents.

Scheduling, customer support and basic questions are most common uses.  But basically, anything that you can "train" for.  So if you have consistent answers to
questions, and not opinioned thought questions then an AI agent can help.  If you have any questions, feel free to reach out and I would be happy to go over it in more
detail.

Hi Karen,

I've been integrating AI into my workflows to enhance efficiency and streamline key processes:

Document Summarization & Data Extraction: I regularly use AI to digest large volumes of information from contracts, agreements, and other documents,
quickly distilling key points and translating that information into Excel summaries for clearer analysis and reporting.

Email Drafting & Communication Support: Based on these summaries, I formulate clear, targeted email responses, improving communication speed and
accuracy across departments and with external stakeholders.

Standard Operating Procedures & Training: I've utilized AI to help draft and refine SOPs and create training materials tailored to specific roles and
responsibilities, facilitating more effective onboarding and knowledge sharing.

Forms & Application Guidance: AI has served as a reliable assistant in completing permit and license forms, as well as drafting step-by-step instructions for
staff tasked with similar applications.

Bank Reconciliation Support: I also apply AI to review bank reconciliations, identifying anomalies such as duplicate payments or long-outstanding checks,
which allows for timely corrective action and cleaner month-end closes.

Overall, I consistently look for innovative ways to optimize workflows and reclaim time for higher-level financial review and strategic oversight.

Patricia Romero

QB is not getting rid of Desktop Enterprise, which is better than Premier and Pro, and includes payroll.  They are getting rid of Premier and Pro.  I looked into switching

to Enterprise, the price was within a couple hundred dollars of Pro plus Payroll.

Dan, I have worked for both Intuit and for the largest QB consulting Firm.  So I have been on both sides.  Although Intuit wants to replicate Enterprise in an Online
version, they have not, nor do I think they will be able to anytime soon.  Enterprise is not going away because it is to popular and well used.  If you are just on pro or
premier, then you could look to Enterprise instead of online.  Online will not be a great fit for your business.  The reporting is weak and mostly cookie cutter.  I think you
will end up doing a lot of work in Excel and then transferring data back and for.  The double entry alone will cost more than the price increase to Enterprise.

If you have specific questions, I am happy to answer them.  Or if you want to speak with someone about Enterprise, I can get you in contact with an expert.  Just let me
know.

I just took 14 of our existing desktop entities to the new IES platform that Intuit is starting roll out. Desktop was becoming too cumbersome and severely lacks when it
comes to multi-entity accounting, which is why Intuit is attempting to enter the mid-market arena with IES. I would say that IES is far from ready for prime time but there
is a tremendous amount of resources being put into it as they attempt to compete with the Netsuite, SAGE, and Dynamics of this space. All of the other comments are
correct regarding the limited nature of the reporting, but if setup correctly we can get a true consolidated and eliminated financial statement. For all other reporting we
utilize the Spreadsheet Sync module.

My GL audit has different rates for sub labor vs sub material.  I ask all of the subs to break down labor & material on their AIA and
invoices to us.  I do not have cost codes set up in our accounting system for this.  I manually track it on a monthly basis.

It saves our company thousands of dollars.

One thing I would find out before you push back is if the insurance company is charging you a lesser rate for the materials of the subcontractor than they are the labor

We have some projects that are within 1.5 - 2 hours from a company office. During these projects we pay per diem to the employee but we have some that are driving
back and forth each day in company trucks. In the past we have allowed this but with the understanding that employees were responsible to put fuel in the vehicle.
Invariably the employees don't pay for the fuel and we have incidents where vehicles get damaged, either with another vehicle or an obstacle such as a deer.

We have decided that we want to stop the usage of company vehicles from traveling back and forth to lower expenses, wear and tear, and liability of being on the road
more. I would like to know how other companies handle this type of situation.

Thank you,

Estimated Labor Cost to EOM for Pay Applications

Reply to Sender

For our pay applications, we've traditionally estimated labor from the billing date (typically around the 20th) through the end of the month. Our current approach is to
take the total labor hours to date, divide by the number of days worked, and then multiply by the estimated remaining workdays in the month. This method tends to get
us reasonably close when we reconcile at month-end.

That said, I'm curious if anyone out there has a more accurate or refined approach, they've found effective. Would love to hear what's worked for you. Thanks in
advance!

Linnea,

I'd be more apt to try forecasting labor than looking at history. The current approach can be fairly close if you generally have the same crew on-site throughout the
project, but in the case of the crew size growing over time, your approach could have you cashflowing the above-average labor cost longer than necessary.

AI Use Cases in Finance and Accounting

I'm interested in learning how others are using AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, etc., in their businesses, specifically as it relates to automating finance and
accounting tasks in small to medium organizations. I'd also welcome feedback on other areas of the business, such as operations, legal, etc. It seems there is a lot of
untapped opportunity to start using AI, especially in smaller businesses. Other than assisting with drafting emails and PPT presentations, I feel like my company has
barely scratched the surface.

Hello, I have inquired about COI Tracking software before and took the advice of someone to ask my insurance agent about what they offer to track at no cost.  This
avenue doesn't seem to fit what we really need which is a shame because it was at not cost.

Now I am meeting with companies to see who I may want to pay to use and the first one I met with is Jones.  It works with Procore which is great and looks like
something we would want to use.  Then there is the cost.  It is $12,000 annually with an implementation fee in the first year to make it around $14K the first year.

Does anyone use anything similar that is more cost effective?  Or is this pretty much the cost for similar products?

Thank you,

Shanda

QuickBooks Desktop native payroll to ADP Workforce. Unfortunately, ADP Workforce payroll implementation was a complete disaster. ADP promised that they could
job cost employee payroll costs and could integrate with QuickBooks. After 1 year, ADP is still unable to process simple employee job costing and has zero integration
with QuickBooks Desktop. If your company relies on payroll job costing as part of allocating direct payroll cost to your construction projects, I would highly recommend
staying away from ADP. There are better payroll solutions for construction companies, such as Mitre and Paylocity. Please don't make the same mistake we did with
ADP; it is a complete waste of time and money.

Subject: Trimble Spectrum with ADP Payroll

Hi Ron,

I sent you an email with a little more detail, but wanted to reply here too. I spent eight years in our professional services group before moving to sales and did a LOT of
these set ups.

Depending on the number of employees, running payroll parallel to ADP is not an issue. You said start up so I'm thinking a lower number of employees (fifty was
usually my baseline for paralleling down to the penny). Properly set up, you shouldn't have many net check differences. For those differences you could adjust each
check for the net to match or just do a cash management adjustment to get cash correct. The other way I used to do it was to have anything ADP pays flow through a
cash clearing account (withholding, employer taxes, child support) and then after processing payroll in Spectrum, do a cash management entry to credit the real cash
account, debit the clearing and payroll processing fees account. Payroll will still have actual costs and burden hitting appropriate jobs/GL accounts. If you are using
Traqspera for time collection, the timecards are sync'd with Spectrum and exported to ADP.

Of course, the method you choose should also take into consideration certified payroll reporting requirements and/or unions.

As the company grows, they might then want to do the payroll bridge with ADP. I think I calculated that 100+ employees was where I saw real time savings and benefits
as the connection fee was a one time hit.

If questions, please reach out.

I recently stepped into a new role at a growing construction company with projected annual revenue between $25M–$40M. We're currently in the process of designing
our financial reporting framework, internal control structure, and evaluating software integrations to streamline operations.

At present, we use QuickBooks Online (QBO) for accounting and Procore for project management. Our goal is to better integrate these systems-creating a more
cohesive platform where we can oversee project budgeting, profitability, and cash flow in real time. Ideally, we'd like a unified solution that connects project
management with finance to enhance visibility and decision-making.

I'd love to hear what ERP or financial management tools you've found effective-especially if you've worked in construction or a similarly complex project-based
environment. Your insights would be greatly appreciated as we evaluate next steps.

Small general contracting firm (we do not self perform any work currently) that is looking to move to a more standardized practice with our cost codes. We have begun

COGS accounts to their codes? Any hiccups that you can call out that you can assist for us to avoid? I am looking and wonder if standard practice is to break
subcontractor costs into material and labor (hence creating sub codes for any cost codes to accomodate).

Regarding your specific issue, I found the information below.

1. Clear Your Browser Cache

AIA documentation confirms that a blank or misaligned document editor often resolves after clearing the browser cache.

2. Stick with the Online Editor

Catina was built to prevent corruption associated with offline Word templates Challenges and Benefits of AIA's New Catina System for Constructi. Transitioning back

What a pickle this process has been.  I am currently trying to get a subcontract out since yesterday but the formatting from our Word template is all jacked up in Catina

Do these rebates come with a 1099?
If their taxable to the company that should be part of the cost comparison analysis.

We are looking at self funding as well and I'm curious about what triggers the rebate and if you could get a reduction of premium instead of a likely taxable event.

Best,

I assume you are asking about the screen below.  This is from a feature in Sage's Intacct Construction solution.  It is a WIP Management application where amounts
are pulled directly out of Sage Intacct Construction and put in the grid you see below.  Forecasts for Cost at Completion and Contract at Completion can  be captured.
It provides for both Project Manager forecasts as well as final forecasts from Finance.  All calculations are automatic and GL WIP entries are posted when complete.
The schedule is then saved and a copy is then prepared for the next month.  An archive is then made for each month/job allowing for period to period comparisons.

Hello,

We are in the process of migrating to Sage Intacct for all of our companies which includes eight construction companies (subcontractors). Several of these entities
handle large volume of jobs for production builders (drywall, insulation, paint, etc.). We have not implemented a Project Management system yet so we currently have a
manual process with tracking job starts, etc. We looked at Sage Construction Management but still needs further development especially with having many different
companies.

* To create a job (project) in Sage Intacct, it requires five separate uploads which we would use to set up many jobs. 1) job set up 2) Cost codes 3) Estimate (costs) 4)
Contract header and 5) Contract lines (revenue).

Does anyone use Sage Intacct with high volume that have created efficient process to set up jobs in Sage Intacct without the use of PM, estimating software which
would directly feed into SI?  Our BI team wants to use QuickBase but won't be implemented any time soon. We are shooting for Go Live date of August 1st.

* A couple of our companies have a high number of extras (drywall company) where we have additional revenue and cost and we are told that we are not able to
upload these changes to the contract and estimates, we will have to enter them manually. Any solutions for this?

A couple of our entities have multiple departments (drywall & paint, concrete & framing) that are operate by separate GM's and Admin Staff. Is it best practice to
turn off auto-sequencing for job numbers or is there a better solution?

For anyone that has implemented Sage Intacct for multiple companies with high volume subcontractors, I would love to have a conversation about your experience and
solutions that you have implemented.

thank you

My COGS accounts are limited to the five major cost TYPES (Labor, Subcontract, Materials, Equipment, Other). On my financial statements this establishes ratios and
reporting for insurance purposes. If I needed to analyze how much I spent on a concrete subcontractor vs a drywall subcontractor, I can do that utilizing job transaction
records filtered by cost codes. Generally, I prefer to leave my financial statements (including COGS) pretty clean and leave the transaction files for data analysis.

However, I am intrigued by your desire to break out cost code amounts to your financial statements. What is motivating the desire to modify your reporting? Perhaps
you can gain better insight if this audience understands the desired outcome/purpose.

Small general contracting firm (we do not self perform any work currently) that is looking to move to a more standardized practice with our cost codes. We have begun

At Lawler Construction, project expenses are tracked through job costing using both cost codes and cost classes. While individual cost codes provide project-level
detail for estimating and tracking, they do not directly dictate how expenses are recorded in the General Ledger (GL). Instead, expenses flow into one of four defined
cost categories, which correspond directly to four specific GL accounts within Cost of Goods Sold (COGS).

The Four Cost Categories and Corresponding GL Accounts:

1.  General Expense → COGS – General

2.  Material Expense → COGS – Material

3.  Labor Expense (self-perform only) → COGS – Labor

4.  Subcontractor Expense → COGS – Subcontractor

Job Cost Estimate Structure:

During project setup, the job cost estimate is entered with amounts assigned to the appropriate cost categories based on the original estimate.



---

Funds are allocated directly to Material Expense, Labor Expense, and Subcontractor Expense when contracts are awarded or self-perform work is budgeted.

The General Expense category is used for:

Items not yet contracted or awarded

Owner allowances

Contractor allowances

Goods or services that will not be installed or used directly on the jobsite

Job Cost Reallocation Process:

As the project progresses:

When a subcontract is awarded, an internal change order moves funds from General Expense to Subcontractor Expense.

When materials are purchased and tied to specific cost codes, funds are moved from General Expense to Material Expense.

For self-performed work, labor costs are tracked under Labor Expense, with corresponding budget adjustments from General Expense.

Reconciliation Between Job Costing and the GL:

On a monthly basis, Accounting reconciles the job cost ledger to the General Ledger to ensure that:

Costs recorded in the GL (under the four COGS accounts) align with totals in the corresponding job cost categories.

Budget adjustments made during the project are properly reflected in both systems.

This process ensures accurate project-level expense tracking, reliable financial reporting, and a clear connection between job activity and company financials.

Hope this was informative yet concise.

I hate to say this, but my purpose is to have the ability to simplify auditing. I have been asked the past several years to make sure that subcontractor costs are
allocated to Labor and Material, and when the cost code is simply "Drywall" then I do not have that option and I am attempting to see if I can simplify that process in my
cost codes to have subcategories and then assign the Labor and Materials COGS.

High level, MEPs, Concrete, Drywall, etc are always a lump sum bid, but the auditor has asked for how the breakout in those invoices. Up to this point, I have simply
applied a ratio to those subcontractor line items where they supply material and reported it that way.

With that context I would strongly push back on this. They do not need to know, and I would be interested in their argument that a reasonable financial statement user
would need to know whether its material or labor the subcontractor is charging for. Because now your asking your subs to track and bill a certain way. They should
point directly to the specific law or GAAP principle they are trying to satisfy and make a stronger case before they have you running in circles on this. If they can't
satisfactorily provide a cogent response you should consider shopping for a new audit firm if they are making this a sticking point because I haven't ever heard of it as a
business owner or as a former auditor with Big 4. If they are asking about completed and stored materials that is something totally different and you do need to track
that and break it out, but as a general contractor we simply do not allow subcontractors to bill us for stored materials because the administrative headache is
monumental.

That is definitely what I have argued and frankly, it has been the same audtior for the past few years, so I have not gotten very far. I let her know that it is not standard
for subcontractors to provide us a breakdown on Labor and Material, and she said for larger companies they require the subs provide that information on their
submittals/bids. We are growing and I want to make sure that I am putting appropriate practices into place that are customary with larger firms. I collect all documents
on subcontractors as a requirement and have them readily available for auditing purposes.

The auditor is assigned based on our GLI and WC policy with Cincinatti, she is local, and I am assuming that given we are in NW Montana, their supply of auditors is
limited. I am glad that you feel as strongly as I do and I do not want to jump through additional hoops. Thank you for taking the time to provide me context and clarity. It
is valued.

With that context I would strongly push back on this. They do not need to know, and I would be interested in their argument that a reasonable financial statement user
would need to know whether its material or labor the subcontractor is charging for. Because now your asking your subs to track and bill a certain way. They should
point directly to the specific law or GAAP principle they are trying to satisfy and make a stronger case before they have you running in circles on this. If they can't
satisfactorily provide a cogent response you should consider shopping for a new audit firm if they are making this a sticking point because I haven't ever heard of it as a
business owner or as a former auditor with Big 4. If they are asking about completed and stored materials that is something totally different and you do need to track
that and break it out, but as a general contractor we simply do not allow subcontractors to bill us for stored materials because the administrative headache is
monumental.

When you say 'auditor' are you talking about a financial statement auditor or an insurance auditor? If its a financial statement auditor then you should push back,
because this is not a valid audit request.  There is no reason to care about this from a financial statement audit perspective.  If this is an insurance audit then they
would want to know the labor cost incurred by your company for workers comp. purposes but I don't see why they would need subcontractor labor.  Although workers
comp. can differ state to state so there may be some unusual regulations/reporting requirements for the states you do business in.

Hi All,

Small general contracting firm (we do not self perform any work currently) that is looking to move to a more standardized practice with our cost codes. We have begun
to implement the CSI codes on the estimating side and accounting side needs to catch up. Anyone make the transition and can assist with concerns on matching
COGS accounts to their codes? Any hiccups that you can call out that you can assist for us to avoid? I am looking and wonder if standard practice is to break
subcontractor costs into material and labor (hence creating sub codes for any cost codes to accomodate).

Appreciate and value any feedback or resource directives.

If you are providing gas cards to employees for their use in their personal vehicles and not having them report business use mileage to you, then yes i would think that
would be taxable to them.

Our company uses gas cards that are part of a fuel management platform with our bank, but we use them in company vehicles only.

Hi All - Our tax provider recently told me that company gas cards should be taxed.  I know company gas cards are fairly common in the industry and I am curious who
is actually tracking the gas card usage and taxing employees.

In our current plan we provide drivers with a fixed monthly reimbursement (which may be subject to tax depending on mileage) and a company gas card with a monthly
limit.

Any insights into this would be much appreciated.

I think this really comes down to weighing risk versus reward based on your specific setup. A couple of questions I'd be asking myself in your situation:

How close is my relationship with our tax provider, and do I trust their interpretation?

Are they trying to solve for short-term audit risk, long-term compliance, or actual tax savings?



---

Are they trying to solve for short-term audit risk, long-term compliance, or actual tax savings?

Who bears the cost if this becomes taxable-does it hit the employees, the company, or both?

Is our fuel program large enough that this would materially impact us one way or the other?

Will making this change hurt morale or create frustration for our team?

At the end of the day, is this worth it for how we want to take care of our employees?

In our case, we lean toward simplicity and consistency with how we handle fuel-if we feel confident it won't raise red flags, and we can explain our approach in an audit,
that's where we usually land. But I know this varies a lot company to company.

Curious to hear how others are handling the practical side of this too.

Payroll is my area of specialty, and Lucrezia is on the right track on this. According to the IRS, anything, be it money, gifts, gas, etc. given to somebody in connection to
the employer-employee relationship is wages, and all related payroll taxes are applicable unless the thing is specifically EXCLUDED in the internal revenue code.
Excluded examples include business expense reimbursements under an accountable plan (like the allowable mileage reimbursement rate cents per mile), section 125
cafeteria items, etc. Providing company paid credit card for the purchase of gasoline is not excluded from wages unless it's substantiated under an accountable plan,
meaning that each time the credit card is used to make a gas purchase, the mileage and the business purpose would need to be documented. If they're filling up their
gas tank with say, 15 gallons then they'd need to substantiate all 15 gallons as being for business purpose. With use of personal vehicle for business purposes, the IRS
allows you to deduct EITHER the standard mileage rate as a business expense OR you can use actual expenses, but you can't deduct both--this is probably why your
tax provider is flagging this

In practice, I've never worked at a company that taxed employees for gas card use. Generally, the cards are issued for business purposes and tied to company trucks.
In cases where project managers or leadership use their personal vehicles, it's understood that usage won't be 100% business-related. The company focused on
tracking for reasonableness, but have never treated it as taxable income to the employee.

We are working towards compliance.  It has been a huge cost and time burden, and I'm expecting it to get worse.  Biggest challenge has been changing how we do
things, educating employees about the changes, then dealing with the fallout because nobody likes change.  We have consultants leading the project, CMMC
compliance is way to complex not engage with a good partner.

Looking to see if any in the group has had experience with insurance rebates on a self-funded plan and how to handle them under ERISA. This is the first year that our
carrier provided us with pharmacy rebates in order to offset some of the fixed costs. They are now telling us that the rebates need to be used to benefit the employees
(premium holiday, pro-rated rebate, etc.). We are just trying to determine the best course of action. Thanks for any input you may have.

Hey Joel, good question, right, wrong or otherwise, and perhaps not in accordance with GAAP, I place all preconstruction jobs on the WIP.  Typically, less than $500k
projects section.  We have a memorandum of understanding (MOU) identifying the billable amount.  I record cost equal to MOU thus gross margin is $0.00 zero.  I
debit cost and credit indirect cost.  The credit is established to off-set preconstruction department overhead. Precon department could be a profit center, however, we
never fully recoup the cost of the department by charging preconstruction or construction jobs.  This is the cost of doing business.  Consider it business development
overhead.

I hope this helps!

Subject: Treatment of Pre-Construction Services Agreements

Hi all,

We are beginning to enter into PCSA's and was wondering if a contract like this would go on our WIP schedule?

The only costs incurred would be labor costs from estimating/admin and small expenses such as fuel, postage, blueprints etc.

It doesn't feel correct to put this on the WIP since it's not an actual job, I'm curious how others treat a contract like this.

Thank you for any feedback!

At a GC I previously worked for we would incorporate the PreCon into the contract and included it in the schedule of values for the overall contract and change order
the actual work later.. So technically it was in WIP but there were never over/under billings since we performed PreCon services as outlined, invoice, and be paid
monthly.

Hey Joel, good question, right, wrong or otherwise, and perhaps not in accordance with GAAP, I place all preconstruction jobs on the WIP.  Typically, less than $500k
projects section.  We have a memorandum of understanding (MOU) identifying the billable amount.  I record cost equal to MOU thus gross margin is $0.00 zero.  I
debit cost and credit indirect cost.  The credit is established to off-set preconstruction department overhead. Precon department could be a profit center, however, we
never fully recoup the cost of the department by charging preconstruction or construction jobs.  This is the cost of doing business.  Consider it business development
overhead.

I hope this helps!

Month-end reconciliation of ERP statements with bank or vendor statements is now easily doable with AI. We’ve built a free AI-powered tool to make this traditionally

It compares two statements line-by-line and highlights:

Hi Everyone,

I'm interested in learning how others are using AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, etc., in their businesses, specifically as it relates to automating finance and
accounting tasks in small to medium organizations. I'd also welcome feedback on other areas of the business, such as operations, legal, etc. It seems there is a lot of
untapped opportunity to start using AI, especially in smaller businesses. Other than assisting with drafting emails and PPT presentations, I feel like my company has
barely scratched the surface.

Thankyou Carolyn. Let me know how the recon looks for June. If someone in your team has time, give it a try for one of your May recons. You'll be able to backtest the
system with one of your known recons. All AI models' outputs are statistical. Even though the model has high accuracy, careful validation of AI's work is a must. Feel

All,

Our company has superintendents that are based in different locations around the country and travel to different jobsites throughout the country. Their normal duration
at the job site is less than 1 year, and we have been paying them a set amount for per diem based on location and federal rates. We don't believe, based these factors,
that their per diem should be taxed however the tax professionals with our payroll provider disagrees and has been taxing these per diems. Additionally, I've reviewed
the IRS guidelines and from my interpretation and based on the parameters previously outlined the per diems should not be taxed.

Can anyone provide any clarification on this issue by "getting out the crayons" for me? Thanks in advance for the help!

Your surety agent/broker or surety company underwriter should be a great resource and provide the information you're requesting.  Slides can range from generic (how
a WIP works) to very specific (tailored for your firm and information level to be passed on to your PM's).  If this is not an option for you, there could be information
available for your download and use at nasbp.org or at learn.nasbp.org/4contractor.  If all that fails, reach out to me privately for assistance.  I've been instructing surety
nationally since 1988 for NASBP (yea, 1988, almost four decades!).

Hello Ann,

CFMA offers two convenient on-demand WIP programs that may interest you and your PM.  The first course I'd recommend is designed for Project Managers:
Financial Mgmt Essentials for Construction Project Leaders  which covers the details about WIP and considers the PM's perspective and use.

If they want or need a deeper dive into WIP:  360° View of WIP for Construction

We are confident that the WIP content and convenience (24/7 access) of either of these interactive self-study programs will meet your PM's needs.  Group discounts
may apply if you want to educate your team.  Please let us know if you have any questions.

Hi Ann - I have developed a course that I teach to PM's and high level superintendents on the "language of construction" and WIP/revised estimates and over/
underbilling are a key section of the course.

I teach virtually and in person.  I do not have any courses on the calendar right now, but also teach sessions to individual companies.

Let me know if you want to set up a call for more information on this.

Absolutely makes sense and thank you for taking the time. I have the same COGS, but the auditor I have dealt with for the past several years in GLI and WC has
asked for Subcontrcotrs to be broken down to material and labor within that GL account. They are aware that we do not self perform, and frankly, how many of your
subs actually break out their costs to show labor and material? Maybe this isn't standard practice and I need to question more, but it definitly has been something I
have had to produce up to this point.

My recommendation is a modified CSI approach!   It works!   Even universities teach CSI!   Do not listen to all this noise!   Follow your initial thoughts!

starts in estimating!  Follow thru in project execution and keep historical data based on these codes!

demand accounting breakdowns from subs to ensure your company has historical and conceptual data by the cost codes!

drive your business so the cost codes are the internal reporting language understood by all!

call if you want to chat on same!

Hi All,

Small general contracting firm (we do not self perform any work currently) that is looking to move to a more standardized practice with our cost codes. We have begun
to implement the CSI codes on the estimating side and accounting side needs to catch up. Anyone make the transition and can assist with concerns on matching
COGS accounts to their codes? Any hiccups that you can call out that you can assist for us to avoid? I am looking and wonder if standard practice is to break
subcontractor costs into material and labor (hence creating sub codes for any cost codes to accomodate).

Appreciate and value any feedback or resource directives.

Modified CSI codes are normal; having a parent subcontractor code with labor and material nested within is not.

I too agree with some of the previous comments that this is a very unusual request for an insurance audit. In addition to that, in some states, depending on the type of
services being performed such as commercial vs residential or new construction vs renovation if a subcontractor was to separate out labor and materials on their
invoices could cause part or all to that invoice to be subject to sales taxes which that subcontractor would have to collect from your company.

One thing I would find out before you push back is if the insurance company is charging you a lesser rate for the materials of the subcontractor than they are the labor
of the subcontractor. If that is the case, then it may be saving you money in premiums doing it that way, but you would have to figure out how much extra time and effort
it takes to break it out relative to how much money you are saving on premiums. Our insurance company does not charge separate rates for subcontractor labor vs
material but maybe that is a thing for larger companies. Just something to think about. If you review a prior audit report, you might can tell if they are charging different
rates or ask your insurance agent instead of the auditor and they might can help you.

Hey Amy,

Just for clarification, this is a WC auditor and not your financial auditor.  Is that right?

If so, it sounds as if they are wanting you to segregate labor from material since WC is usually based on labor.  You can modify the CSI codes or create your own cost
codes depending on your company's needs.  I would set my codes up to give me and the leadership team the information we need to drive strategic decisions.  I would
never change my setup to appease an external player without a valid reason for the change (i.e. regulatory, compliance, legal, more efficient for me and my team, etc.).

The sub should be able to provide documentation as to labor hours/cost if it is your responsibility to provide this to the auditor.  I have never dealt with the GC providing
sub labor detail for WC purposes, but each state is different and there may be something in your state that requires this of the GC.

Still, there should be ways to get the labor detail without you changing you system for a single auditor.

Let me know if I can help in any way.

This is specifically for GLI and WC. I am glad I asked on the forum here, as it gives me a little more backing to argue the case, as I have been. We do business mainly

I'm new to the platform and never used ACD5.  Overall, I like the program, but I wish there was a way to attach exhibits to the contract before sending.

I know you can create a Project Manual but to maintain the electronic signature functionality that has to be done after both parties have signed.

Does anyone know if there is a way to attached exhibits on the front end?

Yes, but it was a very frustrating experience.  The person I talked to did not have a great command of the product.  I went away just as confused as when I started.
Everything that we have learned has been by trial and error with a "Test Project".

Joe,

Do these rebates come with a 1099?
If their taxable to the company that should be part of the cost comparison analysis.

We are looking at self funding as well and I'm curious about what triggers the rebate and if you could get a reduction of premium instead of a likely taxable event.

Best,

Looking to see if any in the group has had experience with insurance rebates on a self-funded plan and how to handle them under ERISA. This is the first year that our
carrier provided us with pharmacy rebates in order to offset some of the fixed costs. They are now telling us that the rebates need to be used to benefit the employees
(premium holiday, pro-rated rebate, etc.). We are just trying to determine the best course of action. Thanks for any input you may have.

Hi all,

We are beginning to enter into PCSA's and was wondering if a contract like this would go on our WIP schedule?

The only costs incurred would be labor costs from estimating/admin and small expenses such as fuel, postage, blueprints etc.

It doesn't feel correct to put this on the WIP since it's not an actual job, I'm curious how others treat a contract like this.

Thank you for any feedback!

We are looking for meeting/conference space (non-hotel) for a late 2025 planning conference with our lead operations people from several states.

We are look at Savannah/St Simon Island, St Augustine, Myrtle Beach, and Charleston.

Does anyone have any suggestions?

Looking for decent access, indoor/outdoor spaces, catering, activities/golf, and preferably in an area that does require everyone to drive.

Thanks in advance for any ideas.

Hi Everyone,

I'm interested in learning how others are using AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, etc., in their businesses, specifically as it relates to automating finance and
accounting tasks in small to medium organizations. I'd also welcome feedback on other areas of the business, such as operations, legal, etc. It seems there is a lot of
untapped opportunity to start using AI, especially in smaller businesses. Other than assisting with drafting emails and PPT presentations, I feel like my company has
barely scratched the surface.

I am in a VP Finance role for a mechanical contracting company in Spartanburg, SC and I was wondering if anyone had any resources for educational classes or
courses around sales tax, tax exemption, its corresponding documents, etc. as it related to construction accounting.

This is an area I'd like to be more knowledgeable in and I'm struggling to find local or on-demand courses for this. I've enrolled in a course, but it doesn't start until
September 30th, so I'd like to do something a little sooner if possible.

Thanks!

These rebates are most likely going to be defined as plan assets so the best course of action would be to apply the funds towards next month's premium. I would
allocate the rebate proportionally by tier and plan type. That would be a clean and ERISA compliant way to use the funds in my mind.

Re: Self-funded insurance plan rebates

Generally, there are 3 ways rebates can be utilized; distributed (shared with participants in proportion to participant contributions), to enhance plan benefits and to
reduce future participant premiums.

You must have an understanding of the pharmacy (PBM) contract to determine a course of action. The type of self-funded plan will often dictate the rebate process.

Are you in a captive, a level funded plan or a partially self-funded plan with a pharmacy contract between Hunter and a PBM.?

 Your broker or TPA should have the answers.

More often than not a Captive will pay a rebate to Hunter after the close of the plan year. If you are in a partially self-funded plan, you might have a point-of-sale
discount (members geta discount applied to their purchases) or the rebates may be netted out of the total monthly drug spend before Hunter pays the invoice each
month. In either of these instances, you are likely fulfilling your obligation to participants by either enhancing benefits and /or reducing costs.

Check out the pharmacy contract and be sure you know how it operates and ask your brokers' compliance team or your attorney to advise you.

Good luck.

Looking to see if any in the group has had experience with insurance rebates on a self-funded plan and how to handle them under ERISA. This is the first year that our
carrier provided us with pharmacy rebates in order to offset some of the fixed costs. They are now telling us that the rebates need to be used to benefit the employees
(premium holiday, pro-rated rebate, etc.). We are just trying to determine the best course of action. Thanks for any input you may have.

It's ambiguous to imply that Rx rebates can be used to offset fixed expenses. Rx rebates typically equal 10 -15 % of your total drug spend. The rebate is usually applied
as a credit on the invoice the plan receives and pays for the prescriptions from the PBM. It's unlikely that you have any other option.

Check out their process for receiving the rebate.

They are correct in that the proportionate percentage of any rebate attributable to employee contributions must be used for the benefit of the participants.

It's generally accepted that the application of the RX rebates benefits the participants by" enhancing plan benefits" (lower cost drugs) and /or "reducing future
participant premiums' (lowers total plan expenses and thereby the future renewal premium).

This is a technical area so please consult your attorney if confusion persists.

Hey Joel, good question, right, wrong or otherwise, and perhaps not in accordance with GAAP, I place all preconstruction jobs on the WIP.  Typically, less than $500k
projects section.  We have a memorandum of understanding (MOU) identifying the billable amount.  I record cost equal to MOU thus gross margin is $0.00 zero.  I
debit cost and credit indirect cost.  The credit is established to off-set preconstruction department overhead. Precon department could be a profit center, however, we
never fully recoup the cost of the department by charging preconstruction or construction jobs.  This is the cost of doing business.  Consider it business development
overhead.

I hope this helps!

Thanks Ron, we normally would treat these in the same manner as you mention, but with this one it's a little different in the sense that we are only contracted for the
Pre-Con Design. It's possible that we may end up doing the job and this case, we would treat it this way, but it's not certain yet.

Big thanks!

At a GC I previously worked for we would incorporate the PreCon into the contract and included it in the schedule of values for the overall contract and change order
the actual work later.. So technically it was in WIP but there were never over/under billings since we performed PreCon services as outlined, invoice, and be paid
monthly.

As you continue evaluating different LLMs for a variety of tasks, I wanted to share a resource that we at Beiing Human find particularly valuable: the Vellum LLM
Leaderboard. It offers a comprehensive, side-by-side comparison of the leading models across dimensions like pricing (per token), context window size, throughput
(tokens/sec), latency, and reasoning benchmarks.

This dashboard is especially helpful when weighing trade-offs between cost, performance, and capability-whether you're optimizing for high-throughput summarization,
long-context document analysis, or mathematically rigorous reasoning. For instance, models like GPT-4.1 nano and Gemini 2.5 Flash provide strong cost efficiency for
large contexts, while models like Claude 4 Opus and GPT-4.1 full offer best-in-class reasoning, albeit at a premium.

If you're using these models directly through a hosted UI (like OpenAI's playground or Claude via Poe), and you're on a paid plan, the leaderboard's reasoning metrics-
such as performance on AIME 2025 (High School Math)-can offer a good proxy for selecting the most suitable model for your task.

We frequently use this dashboard to guide model selection for different parts of our AI pipeline. Highly recommend taking a look.

It might sound cliche but I look for low value add tasks that are repetitive in nature and take a lot of time.

Reconciliations are a good example.

We also leverage AI for invoice generation developed using ChatGPT and Claude & it's making what was a tedious task to be rather simple. Review is a must as some
of the LLMs still throw off errors/anomalies.

Month-end reconciliation of ERP statements with bank or vendor statements is now easily doable with AI. We've built a free AI-powered tool to make this traditionally
painful task much easier.

It compares two statements line-by-line and highlights:

Hi Dan,

It's great to see this discussion around AI and its potential in our field! You're definitely right-beyond drafting emails and presentations, there's a huge, often untapped,
opportunity for AI to streamline operations in small to medium-sized businesses, particularly in finance and accounting.

I recommend two excellent resources to help you explore these possibilities further:

"Beyond the Hype: Unlocking the Potential of AI for Construction Success": This article dives into how AI is already reshaping traditional construction
workflows and offers insights into its real-world implications, current influence, and future capabilities.
"How to Choose the Right AI Tool for Your Construction Business": This blog post offers practical advice on evaluating and selecting AI tools. It covers
crucial steps like defining your business needs, assessing data readiness, and considering integration with existing systems. This is particularly helpful for those
looking to implement AI solutions.

For those who have implemented AI solutions, I'd love to hear more about the strategies you've found most effective for integrating these new tools into existing
workflows.

Great discussion all around!

Hi Shawn,

I pay my employees the current IRS mileage rate of .70 per mile, and the employee is responsible for their gas. I do not pay a daily per diem for job sites that are under
1 hour from your office location, only mileage reimbursement.  When I pay for their mileage, I deduct the miles of their normal daily commute to and from home to the
company's home office.

Hope this helps!

We have some projects that are within 1.5 - 2 hours from a company office. During these projects we pay per diem to the employee but we have some that are driving
back and forth each day in company trucks. In the past we have allowed this but with the understanding that employees were responsible to put fuel in the vehicle.
Invariably the employees don't pay for the fuel and we have incidents where vehicles get damaged, either with another vehicle or an obstacle such as a deer.

We have decided that we want to stop the usage of company vehicles from traveling back and forth to lower expenses, wear and tear, and liability of being on the road
more. I would like to know how other companies handle this type of situation.

Thank you,

Hi Linnea,

I second Kevin's note.  I find it most accurate to look at the project manager's labor forecast to get an indication of which labor to bill ahead for.  The labor forecast can
be simple (i.e. by crew and by week) or more complex (by individual and by day/hour), depending on the needs of the project.

Subject: Estimated Labor Cost to EOM for Pay Applications

For our pay applications, we've traditionally estimated labor from the billing date (typically around the 20th) through the end of the month. Our current approach is to
take the total labor hours to date, divide by the number of days worked, and then multiply by the estimated remaining workdays in the month. This method tends to get
us reasonably close when we reconcile at month-end.

That said, I'm curious if anyone out there has a more accurate or refined approach, they've found effective. Would love to hear what's worked for you. Thanks in

I will triple down here. Your PMs should absolutely be plugged into your "completed this period" fields on your pay applications. I always make sure contract, change
order, and retention values are tracked appropriately, but if our PMs didn't load their own material and labor forecasts into our pay apps our over/under billings would
swing wildly.

Currently we use it to capture information searching from multiple internal documents or emails.  We have the paid version of CoPilot which keeps the information
confidential.  I was able to pull several summaries of emails, files and OneNote files to compile a consensus on a subject including KPI's from several years.  I needed
to vet the information, however with the proper filing could be very helpful!

We plan to budget to purchase Document Crunch after hearing rave reviews from a the CFMA National Conference Roundtable I attended and a demo completed last
year.

We also plan on leaning into some of our software's AI tools to see what kind of reliable efficiencies we can obtain.

What a pickle this process has been.  I am currently trying to get a subcontract out since yesterday but the formatting from our Word template is all jacked up in Catina
now.  Frustrating.

Same! And ZERO customer service.  The phone lines go directly to hold, I tried 3 times yesterday and waiting a minimum of 15 minutes each time.  I also sent an email
over 24 hour ago without any reply.  I also called AIA yesterday, but was told they are no longer affiliated with AIA Contract Documents and they directed me back to
Catina. I haven't been able to issue contracts since yesterday, and it's really upsetting that there's absolutely no phone support.  AIA was never like this before, I was
always able to get support within the hour.  I will not be using AIA documents in the future, if at all possible.  I'll be happy to propose Consensus Docs to our customers
going forward.

Have you had to contact customer support? If so, how long did it take them to reply.  I cannot upload any contract drafts from the old program for finalization.  The
system freezes up and I have to end it in task manager.

I am in a VP Finance role for a mechanical contracting company in Spartanburg, SC and I was wondering if anyone had any resources for educational classes or
courses around sales tax, tax exemption, its corresponding documents, etc. as it related to construction accounting.

This is an area I'd like to be more knowledgeable in and I'm struggling to find local or on-demand courses for this. I've enrolled in a course, but it doesn't start until
September 30th, so I'd like to do something a little sooner if possible.

It might sound cliche but I look for low value add tasks that are repetitive in nature and take a lot of time.

Reconciliations are a good example.

We also leverage AI for invoice generation developed using ChatGPT and Claude & it's making what was a tedious task to be rather simple. Review is a must as some
of the LLMs still throw off errors/anomalies.

Thank you,

If you can think of someone who is deserving of the Rising Star award, I would encourage you to take a few minutes out of your day to
submit a nomination.

I still remember the moment I found out I was selected as one of CFMA's 2024 Rising Stars.

It wasn't just an honor - it was a reminder that the work we do in construction ﬁnance has an impact, and that someone had taken the
time to say, "Hey, this person is making a difference."

If you know someone who's making a difference - whether they're new to the industry or just starting to shine in their role - nominate them for CFMA's Rising
Stars.

Sometimes all it takes is one nomination to remind someone of their value, their leadership, and their potential!

Hi, We hover around 58-60 days but about half of our work is direct to owners. It's a constant balance between price and payment term flexibility.  We have found that
some customers value really long credit terms while others value price and are willing to pay faster.  Just depends on the customer's goals.  We saw an improvement
when we started talking to our leadership about the cost of capital, LOC limitations, and the importance of cash neutrality on large jobs for our growth.  Once that
message stuck, they started placing more importance on it in their negotiations and it was surprising how much improvement we saw in DSO.  Good luck!

We do many prevailing wage projects and that is correct about laborers.  We are a union contractor and any of our workers that aren't
journeyman electricians or apprentices approved by the US DOL can't be on the job.  We employ trainees through a union/contractor
program but which are not technically part of the apprenticeship program.  They can't be on a prevailing wage job.

Hi! We typically try to pay according to the terms we have negotiated with suppliers.  We aim for 45-60 day terms but if the supplier is firm on a shorter window, we try
to negotiate a quick pay discount (2/10N30) and take advantage of that.  We've tried stretching payments in the past to manage working capital but in most cases
we've found that it pays off to be a good partner.  The rebates and discounts that we've been able to negotiate have more than offset any interest on the LOC.  And, our
PMs are SO much happier when they don't have to deal with credit holds delaying their jobs.  Subs generally get payment terms that are flowed down from our contract
with the owner/prime- mostly pay when paid or milestones negotiated upfront.  Good luck!

Hello, I'm seeking input on the general schedule or guideline other companies follow when paying subs and suppliers. I am familiar with pay when paid, but should the
rule be applied to all vendors or only subs? How do you keep cash flow in order when receivables can be between 60-80 days and some suppliers are demanding net
45 or net 30? Is it fair to pay all vendors (subs and suppliers) the same terms the GC is paying us? How do you navigate accounts going on hold or delays to
deliveries? My goal is to determine a best practice to keep vendors happy, processing with a proactive (vs reactive) approach, but also keep cash flow in order. Thanks
in advance for your input!

Hi Daniel,

Here is some information provided to me by a SHRM-CP that might be helpful. I am in TX and the laws in IA might be different. Nonexempt employees must be paid
OT; there is no cap.

We use the GSA site to determine per Diem and Lodging rates for the specific area the employee is working. Employees receive this per Diem on their weekly
paychecks. If there are other incidentals, they are either reimbursed or have a company cc to cover the costs. Unless your travel budget is tight, paying a flat rate and
having the employee responsible for their expenses is easier than tracking receipts.

I hope this helps!

I contacted CFMA with the same question yesterday, and this is the response I got. I haven't tried the link yet, but hopefully it works.

You can download and/or print your CPE certificates from CFMA's 2025 Annual Conference by following the instructions below:

1.  Login to your historical CFMA Learning Platform
2.  Once logged in, you will see the sessions you attended.
3.  Click "Print Certificate" under the session needed.

If you need to pull your CPE certificate for your own records, we strongly encourage you to do so by June 30th.

We are looking to select a new ERP to "go live" either in the last quarter of 2025 or in 2026.  Have other Commercial GC's that have gone through this process utilized
a Consulting firm?  We have received a quote of $30k to do this for us.  Does any recommend an alternate way to do this scrub.

If anyone has a matrix of how they measured/compared ERP's and would be willing to share, greatly appreciated!

Gail,

We started implementing the HR Module several years ago. Because of the time of the year, in addition to the initial setup, we actually began with the Benefits option.
Benefits worked very effective once you work through the options and team members can start their enrollment, select the various options, and the HR team can
review and push through. We had to use Global Software/Insightsoftware to develop some queries to extract data for the various insurance feeds but I believe today
there are other options available that Vista offers. Over the course of about eight months we rolled out Performance reviews, Time Off, Expenses, Training, and the
Applicant Tracking/Onboarding tied to Job Target to proactively manage position advertisements. Team members can view Earnings which include their timecards,
paychecks, W-2s, 1095-Cs, and a Compensation Summary that we modified to include other source of payments to Team Members (car allowance, fuel, phone
allowance, etc.). Team Members can update their personal information, emergency contacts, and see important announcements made by the company via the
Document Dashboard/Group Messages. Team Members can also enter Time Off and see what leave balances they have and project out what they will have through a
certain date. We also use the Standard Time card in HR for hourly office Team Members and have moved forward with the FM module using the Grid Timecard and
other options. Overall the HR and other modules work well but the Training side is not too robust if you want a better L&D and succession planning tool. Suggestions
are made for improvements similar to Vista but it seems improvements have slowed down over the past few years.

We implemented Viewpoint Vista back in 2020 but did not implement the HR module.  We are now looking to implement the module, and I am curious what
experiences others have had with it and if there are any recommendations on how to implement and/or what to implement first since there are so many pieces to it.

Vista doesn't really do an "implementation" for HR.  It is really a "training".  Since it is already there (assuming you are on the Cloud) there is nothing to implement.  I

I'll add to Paul's comments: It's one thing to implement the HR module in Vista, but for the greatest value, you'll also want to implement the browser-based Employee
Portal (also called HR Management, formerly known as Keystyle). It includes employee self-service tools that are easy to enable, along with things that take more
configuration like timecards, benefit enrollment, hiring posting and onboarding. Most of its functions tie in closely with Vista; some replace HR module features that
were originally designed for back office HR and are much more powerful when extended to the Web (hiring applications, for example).

I've helped companies implement the module and the Employee Portal. In my opinion, the most effective implementations approach this just as Paul explained:
prioritizing functionality and mastering each function or block of functions in turn over weeks or months (even a year!) depending on the team's capacity and the
company's needs.

The starting point is integrating the HR module with Payroll (pulling in employees, connecting benefits to deductions/liabilities/earnings). I recommend some care and
planning with benefits; structure it to work with Employee enrollment later, but don't overbuild it such that it becomes a burden to maintain. Also think about how much
backfilling of data you want to do versus just rolling forward (e.g. salary history, drivers licenses, I-9s).

In short order you'll want to tackle the employee Portal. You might begin with onboarding. This has the advantage of getting the HR team into the Portal, building their
experience, and sets the stage for adding functionality and rolling the Portal out to the rest of the company. However, if you're not hiring regularly, that may not be the
place to start. You could instead start with employee self-service and timecards. I mention timecards because that gets everyone in the Portal on a regular basis, and
it's then easy to add other capabilities like time off, bulletins, HR actions, etc. To be clear: when introducing the Portal to the wider company, give employees enough
functionality to make it worthwhile for them to remember their login information. Fortunately, that's easy to do with the Portal.

Another consideration is whether to further extend the Employee Portal functionality with add-ins from Fiddletree Systems, the same guys who originally designed the
Employee Portal. Look at these after you've gotten started with the core Employee Portal and decide then whether they're important to your team.

I agree with Ryan. Don't let Viewpoint selling you too many 'Training' hours. They wanted to budget us for training hours but after we met with them once or twice for a
couple of hours we realized we could do most of the setup and rollout ourselves. We do have an internal applications support team that dedicated time in the setup and
rollout of the all the features and it was not rocket science. Again, the only true modifications that we did were to hire Professional Services to modify the out of the box
Compensation Statement and then spend time using Global Software/Insightsoftware Query Designer and Ultra Edit to create exports for our insurance carrier feeds.

Hello, VP of Finance of a $140+M company. The owner wants me and 1 other team member to take a leadership course that is based more so around construction
leaders so we can better serve our teams.

Has anybody had any good experiences with any? I cannot seem to find many that fit this criteria. Breslin has a leadership circle, for 4 days in the desert, that seems
like it is my best bet for now but the reviews are iffy and 4 days in a desert isn't the most appealing. It does not have to be a travel course I am open to anything really.
Thanks in advance!!

Does anyone have a standard operating procedure (ideally with print screens) for using the Unit Price Billing Module in Foundation?  We are trying to leverage this
area in Foundation and keep hitting roadblocks.  The company has been on Foundation for years, and we find the platform does meet our needs.  However, I am
finding certain functionality was not considered over the years because of the Company's size.  Now that we are growing/have grown, we see a benefit to using this
module, and want to save a little money by avoiding the consultant route.  Thanks in advance!!

We use 16 cost classes to provide details within a cost code.  Each of our cost codes has Labor, Materials, Subcontractors, Equipment, Trucking etc.  This allows our
cost codes to measure a project task rather than an individual vendor.  When a invoice comes in we have our PM's phase/code the invoice to a GL Account, Project
code, Cost Code, and Cost Class to provide this reporting.  Further, in our billing module we map a customer item code to a cost code to provide alignment on how
costs are getting paid.  To Ms. Allison's point, this is more easily typed then executed as there needs to be communication amongst Estimating, Field, PMs, and
Finance, but in the end this model has been working for us.  Our ERP does support this reporting too.

Hi Everyone -

Just curious if anyone codes / puts multiple cost codes to one commitment?  We are exploring this option and would like to know of GCs who are currently doing this.
Currently, we put one cost code per subcontractor.  If you are putting multiple cost codes to a commitment, is the Project Accountant approving this or is the Project
Manager?

Thank you!

We occasionally do this and only on our largest jobs. This usually comes into play with one or two trades, Earthwork and Electrical.

With that being said, we typically ask our subcontractor to submit an SOV prior to their first billing to iron out any kinks in billing and it allows the PM & AP department
to work together to have a master template for that subs billing on that specific project. Once the SOV is marked up with the corresponding cost codes in our system,
we then index it in our Sage Paperless program for later reference. A copy also goes in the paper job file too.

I believe doing so strongly supports and gain/loss reporting a company may do and is significantly more transparent in actual v estimated costs. It also provides you the
opportunity to see if a cost code is over committed, either by estimate error or a legitimate cause and may warrant a change proposal/change order.

We are a GC.  Use Procore financial management tool and have multiple cost codes assigned per commitment.  This is easily manageable via the Procore platform.
The cumbersome part is manually posting invoice by cost code against the commitment line in our ERP system-Spectrum.  We are in the process of moving to Procore
Pay and ERP invoice sync. this will eliminate the manual posting.  There will be some nuisances and limitations with this process and will learn more once going live.
There is no perfect solution, so we chose to pull the trigger on Procore pay/ERP invoice sync.

Good luck!

We do not have a "documented" policy on credit cards but are working to draft one.  Our process is though we use Finvari where superintendents each have their own
card and each card has controlled limits per transaction and in total.  The Finvari system allows for the superintendent to take a picture on their phone of the receipt or
charge, code the receipt to the applicable job details, and submit immediately.  Our Finance staff then gets a monthly data feed to pay for the Finvari charges which are
reviewed (...questioned if something seems odd...), posted to our ERP, and paid.  I believe CapitalOne has something similar and both do offer discounts/points to the
business.  We have had favorable rates with Finvari and I personally like the platform, but I am sure there are others offering the same user experience.

If we find a superintendent is not timely with receipt submissions then a performance conversation is had as we view the Finvari card as a portion of the
superintendent's role which we find helps to control the use of the Finvari card.

Our company has been on BuildOps (with Sage Intacct) since December 2023.  I think it is a fantastic software, and we use it for both Projects (Construction) and Jobs
(Service), as well as the Fleet+ and Payments+ modules.  It has its quirks/frustrations like any platform, but IMO it is a fantastic, and ever evolving, solution.

If you would like to talk about it over a Teams meeting, please let me know, I'd be happy to do so.

I think the functionality of BuildOps depends on the ERP that you are using.  We have recently gone live with BuildOps, we use Spectrum and have had to reach out to
their support team everyday since going live, for us BuildOps has been a challenge.  I wouldn't recommend it if you are using Spectrum as your ERP.

Happy to discuss further if you'd like.

We have been using BuildOps for about a year.  It has positives and negatives.  One of our issues is that they have to do all price updates in the system.  Currently we
have been waiting now for 3 weeks so this is definitely hindering our quoting if you use Pricebooks.  We use Computer Ease for our ERP which they do not link but we
have come up with some ways to make it work.

Hi Shawn,

Go to the Setup menu/ Fringe Benefits Maintenance to update employees as a group. You can select all the employees who have the same fringes and update them.
The wages need to be updated on the first certified payroll after the change takes effect, by employee (wages are not stored in the employee record). If you have a
significant number of jobs, or even a single large job, you may want to consider uploading your data if your payroll software/ERP can export the required fields.

Not sure how many other subs are set up this way, but we have an estimating department that is solely responsible for bidding work, while our construction project
managers are responsible for the operational aspect of awarded projects.  I would love to speak with another (or several) subs that are also set up this way to discuss
your best practices, especially with regards to how awarded bids are handed off.  If you use Accubid for your estimating software, that would be ideal.

Would anyone be willing to have a 15-30 minute Teams meeting with me to workshop?  Thank you

Hi Bryan,

I pay my employees their regular rate for hours worked on the holiday + the 8 hours of holiday pay. Nonexempt employees still get paid OT worked (if any), but the
holiday is paid their straight rate. You could pay your employee double time + holiday pay; that would be generous of you :)

Yes, in Texas, you are not required to have paid Holidays or double time.

Hello, I'm seeking input on the general schedule or guideline other companies follow when paying subs and suppliers. I am familiar with pay when paid, but should the
rule be applied to all vendors or only subs? How do you keep cash flow in order when receivables can be between 60-80 days and some suppliers are demanding net
45 or net 30? Is it fair to pay all vendors (subs and suppliers) the same terms the GC is paying us? How do you navigate accounts going on hold or delays to
deliveries? My goal is to determine a best practice to keep vendors happy, processing with a proactive (vs reactive) approach, but also keep cash flow in order. Thanks
in advance for your input!

Here is some information provided to me by a SHRM-CP that might be helpful. I am in TX and the laws in IA might be different. Nonexempt employees must be paid
OT; there is no cap.

We use the GSA site to determine per Diem and Lodging rates for the specific area the employee is working. Employees receive this per Diem on their weekly
paychecks. If there are other incidentals, they are either reimbursed or have a company cc to cover the costs. Unless your travel budget is tight, paying a flat rate and
having the employee responsible for their expenses is easier than tracking receipts.

I hope this helps!

Hi Everyone,

   Reply to Group Online     View Thread     Recommend     Forward

I'm reaching out to gather some insights on how others handle overtime pay in the context of employee travel for billable work. Specifically, I'm curious how your
policies address the following scenarios:

Is there a cap on the number of OT hours that can be charged for travel days?

When does the travel clock officially start and stop?

Is it when the employee leaves the hotel, arrives at the airport, or when the flight departs?

How is idle time handled (e.g., employees arriving hours early at the airport and waiting)?

Additionally, I'd be interested in learning how others address related considerations such as:

Weekend or evening travel: Do you pay OT for travel outside of regular work hours, even if the travel is not particularly strenuous?

Per diem vs. actual expenses: How are meals, incidentals, and travel-related expenses handled?

Drive time vs. air travel: Is there a different standard for travel by car (e.g., driving to a job site) versus flying?

Comp time or flex time: Are employees allowed to bank hours or flex their schedules to offset extended travel days?

Non-exempt vs. exempt handling: How do you differentiate policies based on FLSA classification?

We're in the process of refining our internal policies, and I'd appreciate any best practices or lessons learned that others are willing to share.

Thanks,

Dan

One concept that I haven't seen mentioned yet in this thread is that if the workers are seasonal, you can annualize the benefits based on expected annual hours (see
the bottom of this DOL page for more details). For example, at a prior company, we provided year-round medical insurance but based the fringe rate on 1,500 hours
per year for some crafts. If an employee went over 1,500 hours, the rate adjusted to $0 for any remaining hours for the year.

We are working on a prevailing wage project. Does anyone know how to calculate what we are paying in fringe benefits (hourly fringe rate) if we are contributing to
health insurance, vacation,  retirement?

I know that we can add all the benefits annually and divide per 2,080 hours to find that rate - but is there a different way or better way to do it?

Hi Eladia,

Our team has been asking the same questions as you are!

My company is in the utility construction space, which involves a high volume of billing requirements and documentation requirements. That naturally opens the door to
hiccups and rework. To address this, we recently worked with John Killingsworth, a Construction Management Associate Professor at Colorado State University.

John has developed a few focused, one-day classes tailored primarily for Project Managers but also useful for Finance and Leadership teams. He joined us at our
California offices last December and conducted three separate one-day trainings with 34 of our team members. The sessions were a big success-John broke down
complex financial concepts like cash flow, underbillings, and working capital in a way that was easy to understand and stick with our non-accounting staff.

We've continued our partnership with John since then, as he now has a solid understanding of the nuances of our business and serves as a valuable resource for
outside, unbiased analysis. The educational sessions were just the starting point-an important first step in our ongoing journey to strengthen financial understanding
across the company and keep collections on track.

If you'd like to get in touch with him, his email is j.killingsworth@colostate.edu. Or feel free to reach out to me directly if you'd like more details!

Best regards,
Chris Delaney

I hope you're doing well. I've been part of the Microsoft ecosystem for the past four years, following over a decade in the construction, building materials, and housing
sector. Based on my experience, I can speak to the Microsoft Dynamics 365 ERP solutions, which come in two primary versions: Dynamics 365 Finance ("Finance,"
"Finance & Operations," or "F&O") and Business Central (BC).

Dynamics 365 Finance is best suited for enterprise-level businesses. Implementations typically start around $1M to $2M, with annual licensing beginning
at $50k (minimum of 20 users).

Dynamics 365 Business Central is designed for small to medium-sized businesses. Implementations can generally start at $20k+ (either fixed-fee or time
& materials), with annual licensing starting at $840 for Essentials or $1,200 for Premium (minimum of 1 user).

The primary goal of an ERP system is to support and streamline your business operations. It's important to choose a solution that fits your needs, not just in terms of
features, but also in scale. Too much ERP can be just as problematic as too little. The key is to find a partner who understands your business and prioritizes your long-
term success.

When evaluating potential partners, I recommend conducting interviews with a few firms and requesting client references to ensure alignment and establish trust.

Attached is the Microsoft Licensing Guide:

BC Capability Chart Pages 6 & 7.

F&O Capability Chart Pages 22 to 25  "Dynamics 365 Finance"

*Note: I have worked in the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central space, but I have been involved in one project with F&O/ CE (CRM).

Hope this helps.

All the best,
Paul

Ana - Determining the proper wage and fringe amounts requires a careful fact-sensitive analysis, especially for employees who work on both prevailing wage and non-
prevailing wage projects in a given year. Errors in such determinations can result in significant legal consequences. Your company's legal counsel or a competent
prevailing wage lawyer should be able to guide you appropriately. Good luck! Best, Michael

We are working on a prevailing wage project. Does anyone know how to calculate what we are paying in fringe benefits (hourly fringe rate) if we are contributing to
health insurance, vacation,  retirement?

I know that we can add all the benefits annually and divide per 2,080 hours to find that rate - but is there a different way or better way to do it?

Thank you

Hi CFMA community,

We're preparing for a migration from Vista on-prem to Vista Cloud, primarily due to Trimble's 2026 support sunset. As I've dug deeper, I've come to understand that
Vista Cloud is not a SaaS-native platform-it's hosted in Azure but still operates as a single-tenant, legacy application.

Unfortunately, this architectural limitation isn't clearly disclosed by Trimble, and it has significant implications for companies like ours who are pursuing a serious path
toward AI, automation, and real-time analytics. Instead of tapping into a modern platform, we'd need to build custom integrations and data layers just to simulate what
true SaaS platforms offer by default.

That said, Vista still performs very well in areas we rely on-job costing, union payroll, and service dispatch-so we're trying to make a fully informed decision.

Here's what I'm specifically hoping to learn:

Are there firms currently on Vista Cloud who are also prioritizing AI and automation?

If so, how are you handling the limitations of the architecture?

Has anyone been offered roadmap visibility or contract flexibility from Trimble to help offset this gap?

Are you layering Microsoft tools like Power BI, Fabric, or Copilot around Vista, and is it working?

I'm specifically hoping to hear from peer firms-not consultants or vendors. If you're in the trenches of making Vista Cloud work in a forward-looking environment, I'd truly
appreciate your insights.

Thanks in advance,

Kyle, this would be what is typically a Sub-Job setup for this contract. You will have one contract, but two jobs linked to it. The jobs are where the Vista system looks for
the PR state and local taxes, as well as Craft/Class Templates. The key is using the JOB to run your reports for the state-specific costs/revenue, but to get

a total picture of the contract/project, you will need to use the contract-based reports.Hopethishelps

We have recently been awarded a bridge tolling where the work will occur in two states - PA and NJ.

Anyone have any recommendations/suggestions for how the job should be set up in Vista to properly account for multi state certified Payrolls, Workers Comp,

Thank you!

Your counsel should have plenty of templates available that both comply with the governing laws of the jurisdiction in which the project occurs and suit the unique
needs of your company and each particular project. Given so many variables in play, using an "off-the-shelf" template could create undue risk.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

Thanks for your response Kyle. I'm reluctant to make this a policy because I've read a lot about people, especially in the US, will take less time off when their time-off is
not a defined amount. The results could be the opposite of what we are trying to accomplish which s a better work-life balance. I appreciate your input.

I've been at companies with both policies.  While I don't have a preference personally, I think unlimited, unfairly, gets a bad rep.  New people especially will feel
pressure not to abuse it and that can create stress.  I think as long as you set the precedent, i.e. encourage 4 weeks +/-, then unlimited does have its benefits to boost
moral and improve work life balance, and it would be my preference.  I don't have to do math if I want to sneak out for 18 holes Friday afternoon after a solid work
week, and that goes a long way.  Either policy had no interference with projects or teamwork; it's unwritten that you don't take time off unless your work is caught up.

Most of the Miter threads I've seen here focus, understandably, on timesheets, certified payroll, and labor cost integration with Sage Inacct.

That said, I'm curious whether anyone is using Miter beyond that scope as a true HRIS.

I'm in the process of evaluating whether to centralize more of the employee lifecycle (ATS, onboarding, reviews, compliance tracking, etc.) in a single system. Miter
claims to support that broader HCM stack. The idea is to avoid bolting on a separate HRIS unless we truly need to.

If you've implemented Miter's recruiting, onboarding, training, or HR modules:

How well do they actually function?
Are they complete enough to replace Paylocity, BambooHR types?
Or is Miter still more of a timekeeping engine with a few extras?

I'm trying to keep the system count low but not at the expense of building a real talent engine. From my seat, the long game isn't just capturing labor to the job. It's
attracting, growing, and retaining the people who can actually run the work.

Would appreciate any perspective especially from others sitting at the intersection of finance and HR strategy.

Just curious if anyone codes / puts multiple cost codes to one commitment?  We are exploring this option and would like to know of GCs who are currently doing this.
Currently, we put one cost code per subcontractor.  If you are putting multiple cost codes to a commitment, is the Project Accountant approving this or is the Project

We do this sometimes but it makes things messy at times if the sub, the PM and the project accountant aren't all on the same page with billing/posting invoices.  I think
it would work well, especially for budget purposes, but only if all parties are diligent with coding the pay applications/invoices.

Hi Christian,

I hope you're doing well. I've been part of the Microsoft ecosystem for the past four years, following over a decade in the construction, building materials, and housing
sector. Based on my experience, I can speak to the Microsoft Dynamics 365 ERP solutions, which come in two primary versions: Dynamics 365 Finance ("Finance,"
"Finance & Operations," or "F&O") and Business Central (BC).

Dynamics 365 Finance is best suited for enterprise-level businesses. Implementations typically start around $1M to $2M, with annual licensing beginning
at $50k (minimum of 20 users).

Dynamics 365 Business Central is designed for small to medium-sized businesses. Implementations can generally start at $20k+ (either fixed-fee or time
& materials), with annual licensing starting at $840 for Essentials or $1,200 for Premium (minimum of 1 user).

The primary goal of an ERP system is to support and streamline your business operations. It's important to choose a solution that fits your needs, not just in terms of
features, but also in scale. Too much ERP can be just as problematic as too little. The key is to find a partner who understands your business and prioritizes your long-
term success.

When evaluating potential partners, I recommend conducting interviews with a few firms and requesting client references to ensure alignment and establish trust.

Attached is the Microsoft Licensing Guide:

BC Capability Chart Pages 6 & 7.

F&O Capability Chart Pages 22 to 25  "Dynamics 365 Finance"

*Note: I have worked in the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central space, but I have been involved in one project with F&O/ CE (CRM).

Hope this helps.

All the best,
Paul

I like Nicole's explanation. I think that is why it's 'double time' in that you're compensating the individual who worked for the holiday, the same way you would someone
who didn't work. then the one who worked gets paid for working.

I think the issue is that some folks then give the one who worked a 'holiday' to use at their discretion. I don't think that is necessary, BUT, it might be a necessity in
certain markets or trades. Workers in these current times, and even generationally, are preferring to take the 'paid holiday' and aren't as interested in getting the 'double
time'.

Hi Bryan,

I can't tell you exactly what the Texas specific employment law is, however, in my past all current active employees would receive holiday if they were eligible (based on
employment time with the company), and then if they worked the day of the holiday they were paid like if it were any other day.  So in your example we'd pay them 8
hours for the holiday and then straight time for the hours physically worked on the holiday.  For your example, 8 hours holiday at straight time rate, and then # of
worked hours at a double time rate if it is your policy that employees earn double time rate when working on holidays.

Subject: PAY FOR HOLIDAY

Hi Bryan,

I can't tell you exactly what the Texas specific employment law is, however, in my past all current active employees would receive holiday if they were eligible (based on
employment time with the company), and then if they worked the day of the holiday they were paid like if it were any other day.  So in your example we'd pay them 8
hours for the holiday and then straight time for the hours physically worked on the holiday.  For your example, 8 hours holiday at straight time rate, and then # of
worked hours at a double time rate if it is your policy that employees earn double time rate when working on holidays.

What we do is pay them the regular 8 hours for their holiday using the holiday pay code and then pay them for the hours that they worked using the normal (not double
time) pay code. So they get paid "double time" in the sense that they get paid for the holiday plus the hours that they work. We do not pay them at twice their normal
rate and also pay them 8 hours for the holiday. We have discussed the possibility of paying them the double time rate and also the holiday hours in the future but we
have not come to a final decision on that yet.

If employee works on a holiday, he gets paid at a double time rate, DOES, he also get additional time for the holiday?  We work in Texas, not obligated to pay double
time, but we do.

We use a standard 45 day payment process for vendors.  However, we allow our project managers to "hold" payments on Subcontractors for project related issues or
billing concerns.  We do use smaller trucking companies who tend to be cash tight so we provide them 30-day payments.  If a vendor wants to be paid sooner than 45-
days we try to get better pricing in exchange for faster payment.  We have a line of credit to manage timing differences between vendor payments and customer
payments.  Our project managers usually maintain communications with vendors for payment delays, however having a line of credit does help to keep everyone
happy.

Hello, I'm seeking input on the general schedule or guideline other companies follow when paying subs and suppliers. I am familiar with pay when paid, but should the
rule be applied to all vendors or only subs? How do you keep cash flow in order when receivables can be between 60-80 days and some suppliers are demanding net
45 or net 30? Is it fair to pay all vendors (subs and suppliers) the same terms the GC is paying us? How do you navigate accounts going on hold or delays to
deliveries? My goal is to determine a best practice to keep vendors happy, processing with a proactive (vs reactive) approach, but also keep cash flow in order. Thanks

I'm not a GC, but I'm constantly seeing their finance teams wrestle with this. Here are a few things I've noticed that seem to work.

A common starting point is Net 45, but they'll shorten terms for critical suppliers (like concrete) to keep a job from stalling. They can often get a 1-2% early-pay discount
for doing it.

With subcontractors, transparency on pay-when-paid is key. If a GC knows an owner pays slowly, they give their subs a heads-up about it from the beginning. It seems
to prevent a lot of friction later on.

To manage the cash flow gap, most use a line of credit. It's better than having a key supplier put a project on credit hold.

The most effective rule I see is also the simplest: no clean paperwork, no payment. It's a hard rule, but lien waivers and COIs show up much faster once vendors
know you mean it.

On your point about receivables stretching to 60-80 days-that's the toughest spot. A lot depends on the contract: If there's no clause for interest on late payments, there
isn't much leverage. It leaves you with a choice: use your own cash or line of credit to bridge the gap, or be completely transparent that payments will be slow. For a
subcontractor, that's why it's so important to be upfront before signing-if your suppliers demand Net 30, a "pay-when-paid" deal with a GC who gets paid in 80 days just
isn't sustainable.

So really, from what I've seen, your best chance is to either avoid jobs with long pay cycles or to have enough of a financial buffer that the long pay cycles don't affect
payments to subs and suppliers. That's in a perfect world, of course.

For subs, yes, they should be held to the same delays that the GC is holding you to. With suppliers, they are often going to be exempt from the pay-when-paid. This
means that you might be paying them in 30 days, even though you will not be paid until 60-80 days.  That sucks, but that is the way. If you have a supplier that is willing
to sign a contract and accept pay-when-paid, great. When a supplier or sub gets antsy, and wants paid quicker, you have a decision to make. How important is it to you
to keep them happy? Sometimes, you can pacify them by paying half now and the other half when you get paid.  But, you still have to pay employees on time, as well
as a ton of expenses not related to the job.  So, either have a lot of money in the bank, or a healthy relationship with your lender. That is a necessity.

If you can, negotiate a quick pay discount with your larger suppliers.  This way, even though you have to pay them sooner than your subs, you can feel good about
saving 1% or 2%.  Again, to initiate this, you will need some extra cash in the bank or a line of credit to use. But, the effective interest rate on the quick pay discount will
be much better than the interest on a line of credit.

I agree with Tom's answer. In a union situation, sometimes part of the benefits package includes 'vacation', and if so should be part of the calculation.

I completely agree on using the 2080 to derive the hourly rate. If you took a $100,000/year super and all of the fringes; Employer FICA, FUTA, SUTA, and any other
state funds, such as WC, Family Leave... Then the ones that the employee sees: health, dental, STD, LTD, Profit Sharing, 401k match, etc. all lead to the total cost that
they have to the company. whether they get one week of vacation or 4, doesn't matter. That is the cost.  divide by 2080 and you get a rate.

Is that too simple? IMHO, that's the only way to figure it out

Unless something has changed I am pretty sure vacation does not count towards the fringe calculation. Not sure what system you use for payroll but most will do the
fringe calculation for you on the certified payrolls if you have it setup correctly in the system. We do it based on an hourly rate based on 40 hours per week which your
division by 2080 will get you that number.

In the case of a Davis Bacon project, you can take credit for all 'bona fide' fringe benefits to the employee.  Vacation and Holiday pay are included.  These are in
addition to the regular base rate.

In most cases to be bona fide, the benefit must be paid to a trustee or be part of a bona fide plan funded by an established policy.  You must be able to document the
cost of the benefit, and the benefit must be regular and predictable, so discretionary or sporadic benefits cannot be counted towards fringe.

If you do calculate the benefit based on 2080 hours, make sure the benefits are provided year round regardless of whether the employee works on the davis bacon job
or not.

Most open shop companies Vacation and Holiday Pay would fall under the rules for an Unfunded Plan. Below are the requirements for you to be able to calculate and
include Unfunded Plans in the Fringe calculation for the DOL. Fact Sheet #66E: The Davis-Bacon and Related Acts - Compliance with Fringe Benefit Requirements

Unfunded Plans. Unfunded plans are defined as any plan funded from the general assets of the contractor or subcontractor. For example, many vacation and sick
leave plans in the construction industry are "unfunded plans." A contractor may take credit towards its prevailing wage obligations for the costs it incurs to provide bona
fide fringe benefits to its mechanics and laborers under an unfunded plan, provided the plan has been communicated to the employees in writing, the cost reasonably
anticipates the cost of providing a bona fide fringe benefit, and the plan represents an enforceable commitment to provide such benefits and is carried out under a
financially responsible plan or program. To ensure unfunded plans are not used to avoid compliance with the DBRA, contractors must set aside sufficient funds to
ensure that the benefits will be available when the workers are eligible for the benefits.

Contractors with unfunded fringe benefit plans must obtain prior approval from the Department, and must submit a written request to the Department by email
to unfunded@dol.gov, or its successor email address, or by mail to:

United States Department of Labor
Wage and Hour Division, Director, Division of Government Contracts Enforcement
200 Constitution Ave., NW, Room S-3502
Washington, DC 20210.

For more information on unfunded fringe benefit plans or programs, see 29 CFR § 5.28

One of my first assignments is to create a one-page economic outlook for our sector. As someone who's still new to the space, I'm reaching out to this community for
insights on where to begin.

Do any of you put together similar outlooks? If so, what leading indicators do you typically monitor? So far, I'm considering SOFR rate projections and trends from the
AIA/Deltek Architecture Billings Index (ABI) as starting points, but I'd really appreciate hearing what others find useful or relevant.

I know that we can add all the benefits annually and divide per 2,080 hours to find that rate - but is there a different way or better way to do it?

I also agree with subjobs... I used this method for a NJ/NY/NYC job, which all operated with different union templates and rates.  It works very well.  As other poster
mentioned, the insurance, craft and tax templates all reside on the job level.  You can have many sub jobs point to one contract.  The Vista Help section on sub jobs is
really very good.

Hi MeChell,

I have been a financial statement auditor and a CFO for construction companies. My former companies have used Sage 300 and my current company is using QB
Enterprise. We are looking to move to an ERP. We do utilize Procore for project management and it is integrated, however I still don't feel like I get all the reporting
abilities I need from QB. In addition, we have two companies that often have staff working for the other company which creates some inter-company transactions. I
don't feel like QB allows us to handle this or payroll very well. Our payroll issue is that recording company paid items (insurances for example) to jobs takes extra steps.
It isn't automatically allocated like employee time. Also, we can't make journal entries into items if there is a misclassification of job costs. Finally, personally don't like
QB because it allows users to delete and/or change transactions after the fact and doesn't create an audit trail.

HI - Congrats!  You are in a great position.  I tell my clients that there are several factors that go into this
decision.  Is this a job that you desire...  ie. new owner that you want to get in with, high profile project, good for
your schedule - these factors and your financial position with regard to overhead put you in a good position to
lower your margin to get it.

However, if timing is bad,  owner is tough (doesn't pay easily, hard to work with) or the job has high risk, then I
say to raise that margin to account for those things.

Good luck !

Subject: Project Gross Profit %

CFMA,

We are a general contractor and have been steadily growing over the past few years and have been performing
larger contracted price jobs. Most of our work comes from people coming to us, but we do also bid on "open bid
style" work.  While it used to be that it might take 5-7 smaller jobs to cover our overhead, we have continued to
run our company quite lean and will sometimes land a single large job that will cover over G&A (overhead)
expenses for the year.  On these larger jobs, our typical job length is 12 months.

Here's the question: When you are confident that your gross profit on your backlog will cover your G&A
(overhead) expenses for a specific 12 month period, do you lower your bid on a project to be even more
competitive?

For example, let's say you normally bid your jobs at 10% gross profit.  If your G&A expenses are around 3% and
already fully covered for the period that the job you are bidding will be completed, would you be willing to bid the
job at 7%, to be even more competitive?

I've heard some people say "if we don't HAVE" to have the work, then we would raise our gross profit %, since we
don't need the job to survive.

Thank you

We are a general contractor of about the same size. We don't have a "formal" policy in place for maternity leave.
We sort of approach it on a case by case basis and what best meets the needs of the employee and the job. I've
had 2 children since working for the company. My situation was a little different because at the time I was the only
one who knew how to do payroll and a few other things. With the first I was put on bed rest pretty early so the
only option was for me to work remotely. With her I only took a few weeks of maternity leave because I had
already been out for so long. With my second we had a management meeting to come up with a plan. I did train
someone to do payroll before I went on leave. I didn't have to go on bed rest and was able to work in person until
closer to my due date. For the last several weeks of my pregnancy I worked 2 days remote and 3 days in person.
The last week I took off entirely to prepare. After birth I was off for 1 month but available remotely to answer any
questions or complete any tasks that the others didn't know how to do. After the 1 month I returned to 3 days in

questions or complete any tasks that the others didn't know how to do. After the 1 month I returned to 3 days in
person and 2 days remote (with flexibility if needed). After 8 weeks I returned in person full time. There wasn't a
set amount of weeks for my full time return date, we just communicated at our weekly meetings and
compromised on what worked best for everyone. This is the same basic policy we have used with all of the
women in the office. Pay during time off was also on a case by case basis. Paternity leave isn't really something
we have done. We have had a few employees request paternity leave but they were all salary employees so they
got paid anyway. The policy for them was that the time off was granted but they still needed to be generally
available to answer questions and complete some required tasks remotely.

Sorry I know that was a novel, but basically you have to decide if a formal policy is needed or if case by case
works better based on the different job factors. Putting a formal policy in place sounds great until an exception
needs to be made, then it can create tension amongst employees. For us, case by case works best.

I'm happy to share some market research with everyone on this topic. Our firm does a tremendous amount of
research on a variety of health & wellbeing topics so if there is anything your companies are interested in, please
don't hesitate to reach out.

According to our data, the median paid leave at most small (<1000 employees) employers is:

40 days maternity leave
21 days paternity leave
30 days adoption leave
28 days of caregiver leave

25% of companies said they were planning to increase the number of paid leave days offered for
maternity/paternity/adoption.

30% of small companies offer an unlimited PTO policy, and 11% of companies said they were planning to adopt
unlimited PTO in 2025.

I'll try to attach the full survey to this reply but if you can't download it feel free to email me and I'll send it to you.

Subject: Retainage treatment - accounting conflict

Good morning, Cafe -

We've run into an issue with the way our sub billing system (Trimble Pay) treats retainage vs our accounting
system.

When a sub submits their draw request the entire bill is entered and retainage is deducted.  When we export from
Trimble Pay to Sage 100 the entire expense is realized with the retainage held separately from the balance due.
However, when retainage is released, Trimble Pay is requiring the sub to submit a new invoice for the retainage.
If we export this invoice we will have double booked the expense for the retainage.  (I believe Textura and
Procore handle this the same way.)

How are you handling this discrepancy?  Do you just "remember" to exclude the retainage invoice from
exporting?  Do you create a Credit Memo for the previously realized retainage?

Subject: Bonus Programs

I really appreciate all of this dialogue around bonus/incentive programs. I am actively working on creating a new
bonus/incentive program for my company and I am utilizing some of the information above to incorporate into our
new program.

I would be curious if anyone has a template/tool that they currently utilize and would be comfortable in sharing.
One of our main goals is that we want to be clear with our messaging on how our bonus/incentive payments are
paid out to each respective employee.

Hello,

I am looking for a 3rd party support company that I can talk with about our ongoing issues we are having with our
move from on premise to the cloud with Vista. Please reach out if your company specializes specifically in
helping clients transition. We made the transition in October 2024 but need some outside support to maybe help
us resolve some items we are not getting resolved through Trimble support and out IT company.

Thanks for your time!

I can't tell you exactly what the Texas specific employment law is, however, in my past all current active employees would receive holiday if they were eligible (based on
employment time with the company), and then if they worked the day of the holiday they were paid like if it were any other day.  So in your example we'd pay them 8
hours for the holiday and then straight time for the hours physically worked on the holiday.  For your example, 8 hours holiday at straight time rate, and then # of
worked hours at a double time rate if it is your policy that employees earn double time rate when working on holidays.

Hello, I'm seeking input on the general schedule or guideline other companies follow when paying subs and suppliers. I am familiar with pay when paid, but should the
rule be applied to all vendors or only subs? How do you keep cash flow in order when receivables can be between 60-80 days and some suppliers are demanding net
45 or net 30? Is it fair to pay all vendors (subs and suppliers) the same terms the GC is paying us? How do you navigate accounts going on hold or delays to
deliveries? My goal is to determine a best practice to keep vendors happy, processing with a proactive (vs reactive) approach, but also keep cash flow in order. Thanks

OT Pay and Travel

Hi Everyone,

I'm reaching out to gather some insights on how others handle overtime pay in the context of employee travel for billable work. Specifically, I'm curious how your
policies address the following scenarios:

Is there a cap on the number of OT hours that can be charged for travel days?

When does the travel clock officially start and stop?

Is it when the employee leaves the hotel, arrives at the airport, or when the flight departs?

How is idle time handled (e.g., employees arriving hours early at the airport and waiting)?

Additionally, I'd be interested in learning how others address related considerations such as:

Weekend or evening travel: Do you pay OT for travel outside of regular work hours, even if the travel is not particularly strenuous?

Per diem vs. actual expenses: How are meals, incidentals, and travel-related expenses handled?

Drive time vs. air travel: Is there a different standard for travel by car (e.g., driving to a job site) versus flying?

Comp time or flex time: Are employees allowed to bank hours or flex their schedules to offset extended travel days?

Non-exempt vs. exempt handling: How do you differentiate policies based on FLSA classification?

We're in the process of refining our internal policies, and I'd appreciate any best practices or lessons learned that others are willing to share.

Thanks,

Dan

Unless something has changed I am pretty sure vacation does not count towards the fringe calculation. Not sure what system you use for payroll but most will do the
fringe calculation for you on the certified payrolls if you have it setup correctly in the system. We do it based on an hourly rate based on 40 hours per week which your
division by 2080 will get you that number.

We are working on a prevailing wage project. Does anyone know how to calculate what we are paying in fringe benefits (hourly fringe rate) if we are contributing to
health insurance, vacation,  retirement?

I know that we can add all the benefits annually and divide per 2,080 hours to find that rate - but is there a different way or better way to do it?

Hi Walt,

We are currently using Kojo and also use Foundation.  We like it overall, some bugs on the app we are currently trying to get resolved
with their support team.  We mainly use it for material purchasing and don't use the other modules.  We are a smaller contractor so we
don't need the extra modules, although the invoice matching seems to be a nice feature.   Respond to me directly if you have more
detailed questions.

Hi Andre,

The five week, live online Certificate Program topics follow the domains of the CCIFP Certification on what Construction Financial Professionals need to know to pass
the exam and get certified. The Budgeting and Planning topic makes up 14% of the exam content. Listed here is the breakdown of the other domain topics.

Accounting & Reporting, 23%
Revenue Recognition, 21%
Budgeting & Planning, 14%
Risk Management, 13%
Legal, 9%
Human Resources, 7%
Information Technology, 7%
Taxes, 6%
The CCIFP on-demand program is a six and half hour self study, self paced program you can view any time. It contains content on all eight of the domain topics, as

We have 2 projects with CUI.   We have been working on it for 3 years.  The cost and time burden has been huge. We are implementing a software solution called
PreVeil.  It covers 108 of the 110 points.  They have a Compliance Accelerator to assist with the rest.  It works as an addin to Outlook and File Explorer to encrypt the
data. It has a lot of automated features. We has also looked at MS Enclave but it is not user friendly because it requires a separate email account.

We are a small architecture firm expanding our business to include general contractor services. We've done a few small ($250k - $300k) commercial refresh projects,
but have a couple of significantly larger projects in the pipeline. We currently use Quickbooks Enterprise Desktop for the architecture and GC businesses, but feel like
we'd benefit significantly from a more robust ERP. Any suggestions on software to help us get through this phase of our growth cycle? We are considering Knowify, but
aren't thrilled with being committed to Quickbooks Online.

Completely agree that QB Enterprise can be stretched pretty far, but it has real friction points, especially for CFOs used to platforms like Sage 300.

I ran finance for a trade contractor doing $80–100M on QB Enterprise. We made it work, but only with strong process controls and a separate reporting layer in Power
BI and Excel. Intercompany accounting and payroll allocations were both pain points as labor could be assigned to jobs, but non-wage burdens (insurance, fringes)
required extra steps. And once a job cost is misclassified, the inability to reclass via journal entry into an Item creates real cleanup headaches.

The audit trail issue is also real as users can delete or modify transactions unless roles are tightly restricted and logs are routinely monitored.

That said, one area where QB shines is the talent pool. It's much easier to find staff-AP, AR, payroll, and even junior PM admins-who are already QB-fluent.
With Sage or other construction ERPs, the labor pool is much smaller, and onboarding takes longer. We saw that tradeoff clearly: QB gave us flexibility in hiring and
speed in training, while the ERP systems we considered would have required heavier investments in both change management and training.

If you're already on Procore, the shift to a more robust ERP makes sense but it's worth factoring in both system capability and who you can realistically hire to run it.

Hi all,

For those currently using Quickbooks, how have you found analyzing projects? Are you able to run job costing and analyze in an effective manner?

We're an electrical contractor currently on Sage 100 and most jobs are $100-1M, but some run $3-4M. Long story, but we're making some other changes to systems
and processes, and we're considering what sort of impact moving to Quickbooks would be. We haven't heard of anyone doing this, so we're a bit concerned about what
insight we might be giving up!

Recommend you consider a more contractor tailored ERP like Foundation rather than trying to use Quickbooks if your company appears to be in a period of growth
and are considering migrating your systems to a new platform.  I have seen Quickbooks used for construction and find most companies end up going to a more robust
platform as they out-grow Quickbooks quickly.  I cannot speak to Sage 100, but if you are not happy with what Sage 100 is doing it might be more on how Sage 100
was implemented which if your team is familiar with Sage 100 and you are thinking of changing systems then it might be the time to "re-implement" Sage 100...Hope
this helps

I recently joined a Midwest-based civil highway construction company and, on the recommendation of my boss, became a member of CFMA to deepen my
understanding of the industry.

One of my first assignments is to create a one-page economic outlook for our sector. As someone who's still new to the space, I'm reaching out to this community for
insights on where to begin.

Do any of you put together similar outlooks? If so, what leading indicators do you typically monitor? So far, I'm considering SOFR rate projections and trends from the
AIA/Deltek Architecture Billings Index (ABI) as starting points, but I'd really appreciate hearing what others find useful or relevant.

Thanks in advance for your guidance!

We are a MEP specialty sub and are looking at Siteline's platform to aid us with lien waiver management (we do NOT need their billing component).  We've been
quoted at approximately $6K/year for it.

Can any other subs that currently today or in the past have used Siteline specifically for the lien waiver management share your thoughts on the platform, and either
good or bad what impact it had on your overall cash collection/days sales outstanding?

John,

We implemented Miter a year ago. We use the timekeeping, payroll, onboarding, and HR modules. We are going to use the system for reviews, they call it
performance, this year. We don't use the recruiting piece, 401k integration, or workforce management pieces at this time.

At my previous company we used Sage 300, Exaktime, and Bamboo. When I came here, like you, I didn't want several different systems. Miter has so far done the job.
The main thing I have learned with Miter and Sage 300, is the little nuances to make sure everything sync's correctly. Or to make sure the proper approval process is
followed in the edge cases.

Overall, I would recommend Miter. Everyone here seems to like it. They like that they have their own portal to access to their paystubs, W-2, and other documents.
They also like they can fill out all their onboarding forms, tax forms, and other items in the system.

Two things to potentially be aware of. First, they are still a relatively new system. The amounts of reports they have available relative to Sage 300, is really low. They
make up for this by allowing customizable reports and they accept feature requests. But it is something to ask about in a demo, if you have specific reports you like to
run. The second thing, is their support wasn't the greatest when we signed up. They have done a lot of work to fill out and upgrade the team, but it can still be slow. We
are currently one of their beta testers for a support line. They used to only accept emails.

Anyway, let me know if you have any questions.

Subject: Miter as HRIS ... Any Real Experience Beyond Timekeeping?

Most of the Miter threads I've seen here focus, understandably, on timesheets, certified payroll, and labor cost integration with Sage Inacct.

That said, I'm curious whether anyone is using Miter beyond that scope as a true HRIS.

I'm in the process of evaluating whether to centralize more of the employee lifecycle (ATS, onboarding, reviews, compliance tracking, etc.) in a single system. Miter
claims to support that broader HCM stack. The idea is to avoid bolting on a separate HRIS unless we truly need to.

If you've implemented Miter's recruiting, onboarding, training, or HR modules:

How well do they actually function?
Are they complete enough to replace Paylocity, BambooHR types?
Or is Miter still more of a timekeeping engine with a few extras?

I'm trying to keep the system count low but not at the expense of building a real talent engine. From my seat, the long game isn't just capturing labor to the job. It's
attracting, growing, and retaining the people who can actually run the work.

Would appreciate any perspective especially from others sitting at the intersection of finance and HR strategy.

Thanks for the detailed reply as this is exactly the kind of grounded feedback I was looking for. They're on Sage Intacct (Construction) and have been evaluating
whether Miter could become our central HRIS platform. Sounds like it handles core workflows well, but that reporting depth and implementation support are still
evolving.

Curious: how have you handled compensation planning or performance review calibration in the system? And have you done anything to supplement reporting e.g.,
Power BI or outside tools?

Appreciate the heads-up on sync nuances and support expectations. That's the type of stuff that gets lost in demos.

Documents in Cloud ERP-Secure?

I'm trying to determine if the documents being stored in our Cloud ERP (Viewpoint Spectrum) are secure and what others are doing.  We are planning to implement the
TC1 HR module and have all documents electronically stored.  As you know this is sensitive information.  I'm being told by Spectrum support that the cloud documents
we attach are only accessible through their platform.  This is a concern for me also in access to those documents if we changed ERP systems.  Can you please tell me
your SOP for retaining documents (this is also the same for our customer / vendor setup docs & AP invoices, WO's and PO's).  Thank you

Small Civil Contractor Service/Ops Software

A company I know is looking for operational software to help it manage its operations. It uses QuickBooks for accounting. It has about 20 field employees and primarily
provides water/sewer utility services, such as on-call repairs for municipalities. They also have some projects, such as commercial & residential sitework. They are
looking for something that would work well for their scale, focused mainly on scheduling, dispatching, and billing. They have heavy equipment and dump trucks, so
they'd want software designed around the civil market. Does anyone have any suggestions for software systems that they should consider?

Anyone have any recommendations/suggestions for how the job should be set up in Vista to properly account for multi state certified Payrolls, Workers Comp,

From a high-level, you could have two jobs under one contract. Each job could have its respective tax state and craft class template. The real problem would likely be
getting information in the field separated correctly. Hopefully, someone who's done this before can chime in on the caveats.

We are working towards compliance.  It has been a huge cost and time burden, and I'm expecting it to get worse.  Biggest challenge has been changing how we do
things, educating employees about the changes, then dealing with the fallout because nobody likes change.  We have consultants leading the project, CMMC
compliance is way to complex not engage with a good partner.

Currently trialing a corporate card and fuel card with Corpay in the hopes that they produce an AP Automation solution soon. The idea is that PMs would be able to
code their corporate card transactions and job invoices all in one place. Eventually we may explore their Epayments solution as well.

Trimble's (TC1? / Team? / Viewpoint? / Who Knows…) Automatic Invoicing solution is not an option since it does not allow job coding prior to batching into Spectrum,
which makes no sense. The Workflow module in Spectrum could solve things, but I could see the Spectrum UI being a bit confusing for our PMs.

With Corpay's recent investment in AvidXchange and strong relationship with Trimble, I am putting my money on them to hopefully solve our AP woes.

before the Captive for over 20 years and been very happy with them. I highly recommend giving them a call!  They are VA

We moved to Cottingham & Butler (Emily Glanz - who just spoke at a session at CFMA National Conference) about 5 years ago and have been very happy with the
service and the knowledge of the construction industry and what should be in our policies.  We are hoping to move into a Captive in the next year or two, but having the
relationship with our broker first to have the confidence that they will lead us to the correct Captive at the time that is right for us has been very important.

If you want Emily's contact information, let me know and I can get it to you.

Good luck.

I was in a captive from 2002 to 2022.   COVID condensed my company to the point that it was not
worth the risk to continue.  We are back in growth mode and when I feel the time is right, I will be re-
applying for membership.

I will 100% recommend Complete Structure Ltd. as a homogeneous construction captive, and Bob
DeChene as an agent.  Full transparency – I still have a ﬁnancial obligation to Complete Structure
as a former member, but I'm not going to receive a commission if you join LOL.

This was my second captive experience.  The ﬁrst one was not a good experience because of the
organization in charge of running the captive.

CS was directed by Innovative Captive Strategies, which has been an innovator in the captive
industry.  They can help you ﬁnd the best ﬁt for your company.

As you know, the key to a captive is controlling your risk and controlling your losses.  They get
that.  When you control risk, the reward follows.

Emily and the team from Cottingham & Buttler are sharp, responsive, and bring a level of transparency and strategic thinking that's rare. She's especially good at
navigating captives and helping clients understand the full picture when it comes to fees, risk, and long-term cost management. In addition to that she is a contributor
here on CFMA in building Profits and she did a great session on risk transfer at the national conference.

I'd definitely suggest having a conversation with her.

Emily Glanz,  AAI, CIC, CRIS

Hello all,

Wondering what insurance brokers you guys use, we are in a captive as of earlier this year. We are having issues with our current broker not being transparent enough
or up front and honest with our captive, with some higher fees and costs we werent aware of. We have not shopped in years and want to start shopping this
summer/fall. Any input helps!

Thanks

I second IMA.  Our current broker became part of IMA a couple of years ago, and things have been great.  It's a continuation of a 25 year relationship.  The office we go
through in Alaska is incredibly knowledgeable, and I usually have answers from them within a couple hours at the most.  We keep them busy.

I'd also look at your local USI office.  I've seen some of their tools and support, and they've looked pretty impressive as well.

Curious to hear from anyone who has experience with a discretionary or unlimited PTO policy. We're considering the pros and the cons and would like to hear from
anyone that is contemplating it or has adapted such a policy. A few questions that come to mind.

Did the policy feel genuinely flexible, or was there pressure (spoken or unspoken) not to take time off?

Was the policy extended to all roles, including field teams, or just office staff?

How did time-off requests affect project schedules and team dynamics?

Did the policy improve work-life balance, or create confusion and inconsistency?

Were there any unintended consequences-positive or negative?

Lucas Kelly

Hi Everyone

We have had Foundation Construction software since 2017. We have a added a second location and would like to keep up with it separately. After talking to
Foundations we have two options which is get a second data base or start using divisions. From the little bit of research that we have done, the divisions sound like a
better option.

Does any one have any experience in adding this to their company to keep up with separate locations? Also would like to add that we are thinking of adding other
locations in the future and want to make sure that this option will grow with us.

Thanks

We are a Colorado based contractor in the process of converting to Spectrum and wanted to see how anyone has setup their payroll to be able to upload certified
payroll utilizing LCP Tracker. My understanding, so far, is utilize union codes for the job and wage codes for the applicable crafts. What I'm not sure about is how to
populate the available fields in the job and wage codes to feed into LCP tracker upload. In particular, the 4 digit craft number, craft description and the specific work
being performed with each specific craft. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Spectrum + Traqspera - Shift Differential for Out of Town/Overnight Work

Clair Barutt

Hi all,

We're exploring the possibility of implementing a shift differential-for example, an extra $2/hr-for technicians and laborers who are working out of town overnight. I'm
curious how other organizations are handling this or similar differential situations within the Viewpoint Spectrum payroll module. I would note this doesn't just relate
to job labor but also labor related to work orders.

We do use Traqspera for timekeeping, so additional insights on how to best capture and code this differential in Traqspera to ensure it flows correctly into Spectrum
payroll, would also be helpful and appreciated.

Thanks in advance for any thoughts, processes, or examples you're willing to share!

Hey Andre,

I would love to have a call with you to see if we're a great fit for each other. HORNE has a dedicated construction group and offers Fractional CFO services, Assurance,
Tax, Client Advisory Services, leadership development, and so much more. I joined HORNE more than a year ago after spending the last 2 decades in construction –
the last 8 years as the CFO of an industrial/commercial GC that grew from $30M to greater than $100M during my time there.

The problems each contractor faces may appear similar, but the drivers are always very specific to each companies' situation. Our model is built around partnering with
you so that we can understand your challenges. This allows HORNE to better refine and optimize processes, train your staff to work more efficiently within your system,
and provide the strategic leadership you need.

HORNE has a large presence in Louisiana, and we can provide all the references you may need.  Please check us out at horne.com/construction.

Talk to you soon.

Has anybody had any good experiences with any? I cannot seem to find many that fit this criteria. Breslin has a leadership circle, for 4 days in the desert, that seems
like it is my best bet for now but the reviews are iffy and 4 days in a desert isn't the most appealing. It does not have to be a travel course I am open to anything really.
Thanks in advance!!

I recently prepared a document looking 10 - 15 years out. My goal was not to produce a forecast but to identify the long-term trends that would influence future
spending and to monitor those trends. My research included:

Forecast population trends
Historical trends in highway miles, lane miles, and vehicle miles traveled. (In California, the state publishes a record)
State transportation policies. Each state is required to submit a Highway System Performance Management Plan to receive IIJA funds.
A review of your state transportation budget. It's interesting to see the sources and uses of state transportation funds and how much, or how little as the case
may be, actually flows to state and local transportation infrastructure. You will likely find that the primary sources of funds which are typically fuel taxes and
licensing fees, are highly sensitive to economic conditions.
Construction employment, construction spending, and GDP by state and MSA. You can get this from the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the St Louis Federal
Reserve (FRED). bea.gov and stlouisfed.org

Subject: Civil Highway Economic Outlook Indicators

Hello everyone,

I recently joined a Midwest-based civil highway construction company and, on the recommendation of my boss, became a member of CFMA to deepen my
understanding of the industry.

One of my first assignments is to create a one-page economic outlook for our sector. As someone who's still new to the space, I'm reaching out to this community for
insights on where to begin.

Do any of you put together similar outlooks? If so, what leading indicators do you typically monitor? So far, I'm considering SOFR rate projections and trends from the
AIA/Deltek Architecture Billings Index (ABI) as starting points, but I'd really appreciate hearing what others find useful or relevant.

Thanks in advance for your guidance!

We have been utilizing Siteline for approximately eight months now. Initially, I adopted the platform specifically for managing lien waivers, and I am pleased to say that I
am thoroughly impressed. The color-coded status indicators for lien waivers greatly enhance visibility and streamline the tracking process.

Although I initially did not anticipate needing Siteline for billing, as we currently use Sage 300, our project managers have found the interface to be highly intuitive and
visually appealing. They especially appreciate the ease of creating monthly billings and the detailed tracking of each step involved in the process.

One feature I particularly value is Siteline's ability to incorporate custom billing or lien waiver forms provided by general contractors, ensuring that all required
documentation is accurately submitted. Additionally, the new collection tab has proven to be extremely helpful in tracking communications and understanding the latest
status updates regarding payments.

Overall, Siteline has significantly improved our workflow and communication efficiency.

We are a MEP specialty sub and are looking at Siteline's platform to aid us with lien waiver management (we do NOT need their billing component).  We've been
quoted at approximately $6K/year for it.

Can any other subs that currently today or in the past have used Siteline specifically for the lien waiver management share your thoughts on the platform, and either
good or bad what impact it had on your overall cash collection/days sales outstanding?

I also agree with subjobs... I used this method for a NJ/NY/NYC job, which all operated with different union templates and rates.  It works very well.  As other poster
mentioned, the insurance, craft and tax templates all reside on the job level.  You can have many sub jobs point to one contract.  The Vista Help section on sub jobs is
really very good.

So much great advice already added so far, but I will say that when I implemented Vista many moons ago, we started with HR in tandem with Payroll.  It's essentially a
switch you will "flip" to begin the task of adding employees to HR instead of PR.  Once you do this, you have a much better way of managing all sorts of Employee
related tasks and collateral, deductions, liabilities, even assigned computers etc. I would start with doing the basic onboarding into HR and then little by little, add
functionality.  I will be helping my clients add this very same functionality in the near future since they, like you, started with only utilizing the payroll module. I do think
the module is straight forward, but setups do need thoughtful consideration.  The HR module itself frequently frustrated my payroll manager with onboarding quirks, so
those personnel will definitely need to be part of your training workflow.  All this considered, it's a gem if you ask me.

2) Full company budget (rolled up from job specific budgets and inclusive of overall company operating budget)

3) What/how do you utilize the system for longer range forecasting?

We also give raises once per year, generally in February.  We peg the base amount of the raise to the inflation rate for our region.  Underperforming employees get
less, overachievers more.

As for the bands, we use compensation data that we get from outside sources and adjust accordingly if we do not get many hits when we post a job vacancy.

Looking to find out what others are doing in the way of annual compensation increases.

Do you do this annually on a specific schedule for all employees, select, every other year, etc.



---

Also, what guidelines are you using as far as salary ranges and top out of a position.  Do you give bonuses after a top out on a range?  How often do you update the
range data?

Basically any information would be helpful as we do not have a formal policy and just increase salaries as we feel appropriate.  Sometimes we do annual or sometimes
we don't give any for a few years and are hoping to get a formal policy and procedure in place.

Thanks

Have you tried setting up the job with a phase specific for pre-con, i.e. phase 100 is always pre-con work and 300 is always job in progress work?  I know Sage 100

Good morning all.  At my previous employer we did not setup a job in our system until the contract was executed and the Accounting team would set it up.  My current
employer (we are all a learning group) wants the job set up before anything kicks off so they can track their precon time.  I tried to set up a job for prospective clients
and it did not turn out well.  We are currently using Procore and Sage 100 Contractor (soon going to Acumatica) and ADP for our payroll/time entry.  Could anyone
chime in and give some useful tips for making this work so that it does not affect reporting.  I wondered if I should just set up an ADP for the tracking but they want it
setup for Procore linking as well.

Your feedback is much appreciated.

Sargent offers 10 days of paid leave which can be taken any time prior to the birth/adoption for medical/court visits, and/or the immediate 2 weeks after birth/adoption.
Most of our folks choose the 2 weeks post birth, but it's an option in advance of birth if an employee-owner needs to take a full day off to attend an ultrasound. We have
500+ employee-owners.  The majority of our employee-owners are located in Maine which recently passed the Maine Paid Family Medical Leave act which offers paid
leave for the full 12 weeks for the same qualify events that trigger FMLA.  Employers and employees each pay in 0.5% tax during 2025 in anticipation of the state
offering the benefit in 2026.  It's going to be a challenge for employers and may lead to a change in our Paid Parental Leave.

We allocate based on nature of expense.   For example, payroll/HR is allocated based on headcount.   Some expenses are allocated based on

If it is just a separate office (division) and not a separate company, the expenses associated with that office should be easily trackable.  The
shared services, like accounting, HR, maybe some high level operations are not as easily trackable to the time spent working on or for that
location.  We have several companies that we charge a management fee which we determine at the beginning of the year based on the
estimated time we spend working for those companies.  We didn't want to get into tracking and managing the time each month as it added more
headache than value.  You could do that same thing for a division or just look at OH as its own budget line item and not worry about how much
time the shared services work on that office.  I think we get to caught up in allocating a dollar with little to no value.  It just depends on what you
are considering shared services and if you are actually going to use that information to evaluate that office.  If you look at it this way, are you
going to let go any of the shared services if that office goes away, if not, then your cost didn't change so no real need to track it that way.  If you
are evaluating if you need to add a body to support that office, then you might want to track it so you don't burn your existing employees out.

We have opened a new office in another state and are currently in discussion on how to charge a shared service fee.  This would consist of
teams that cross over from our headquarters assisting with projects in the new office, cost for our current office, office supplies that might be
used for this office...  How granular do you get with this data.

I would like to hear from others on how you guys handle shared service fees.  Do you charge based on a % of revenues, # of employees that
assist with the projects, or do employees keep track of time that they work on a project for that city and that is allocated to the shared service
fee.  Does any one also incorporate meals as part of this fee as well.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

We have 2 subsidiaries that we charge out an allocated overheads to. This consists of our home office costs, including accounting, software,
legal fees, company meetings, etc. We have a spreadsheet that we review with the subsidiary managers each year to make sure the cost
should be allocated and to what degree. We then charge on a % basis based on the % of revenues. We make an estimated quarterly charge
and then true up once yearly financials are completed.

I can provide more detail of to exactly what gets charged if you're interested. Feel free to e-mail me (Jeff.Litwin@aceservinc.com)

We created a separate management company and each operating company pays a management fee as a percent of their revenue. All common
employees work for the management company: accounting, human resources, IT, marketing, fleet management, and executives. The
management company's goal is to break even. We periodically review the management fee to decide whether to adjust it up or down, but it has
remained steady for many years.This also puts a natural budget on our management team. If the operating companies grow in revenue,
management fees increase and the management company can bring on new staff to handle the growth. If operations shrink, the opposite is true
and we are forced to trim our management expenses (as opposed to raising our management fee.)

We started using Kojo (purchasing software) on May 1 and all of the related invoices are processed right within that system. It is fantastic.
Our understanding is that Kojo eventually be able to process all invoices and we are looking forward to that.

We use a program called Workmax. Our employees log in and out of Workmax. We export the hours onto an excel spreadsheet for entry into
Paychex. Then we use Connectmax to import the hours on jobs.

At the end the taxes are off just a little and I have to go through our payroll of 72 people and make sure that all numbers match. I have to
change the Workers Comp, the 401k match, the State and Fed, the disability and occasionally medical and SS. It is a process that takes appx 4
hours. I was hoping you had some insight into this.

We use both Sage Contractor 100 and Paychex.  I input all payroll information into Sage and only report hours worked, etc. to Paychex for
payroll processing.  All job costing and overhead info is maintained in Sage for our historical purposes.  We reconcile our Sage payroll data with
the Paychex records each week to make sure all is balanced and accurate.

Does anyone use a timekeeping system with clock in/clock outs that have employees work on the last day of the defined workweek but has clock in that starts on the
last day of the workweek but rolls into the next workweek day? Does your system separate the hours past midnight or do pay the employee for the hours worked in the
entire shift that started in the current workweek?

If your ERP does the separation can you tell me what system you are using?

All:
We are exploring Concur for AP automation and use Spectrum as our ERP.

We use purchase orders and subcontracts.  Does anyone use Concur?  How are you are you connecting Concur to you ERP?  How are you syncing or extracting
data?  API's?
Any information would be helpful as Concur as a service provider isn't really an integrator.

Thanks

Wondering what insurance brokers you guys use, we are in a captive as of earlier this year. We are having issues with our current broker not being transparent enough
or up front and honest with our captive, with some higher fees and costs we werent aware of. We have not shopped in years and want to start shopping this
summer/fall. Any input helps!

I've been at companies with both policies.  While I don't have a preference personally, I think unlimited, unfairly, gets a bad rep.  New people especially will feel
pressure not to abuse it and that can create stress.  I think as long as you set the precedent, i.e. encourage 4 weeks +/-, then unlimited does have its benefits to boost
moral and improve work life balance, and it would be my preference.  I don't have to do math if I want to sneak out for 18 holes Friday afternoon after a solid work
week, and that goes a long way.  Either policy had no interference with projects or teamwork; it's unwritten that you don't take time off unless your work is caught up.

Subject: Unlimited or Discretionary Paid Time Off

Curious to hear from anyone who has experience with a discretionary or unlimited PTO policy. We're considering the pros and the cons and would like to hear from
anyone that is contemplating it or has adapted such a policy. A few questions that come to mind.

Did the policy feel genuinely flexible, or was there pressure (spoken or unspoken) not to take time off?

Was the policy extended to all roles, including field teams, or just office staff?

How did time-off requests affect project schedules and team dynamics?

Did the policy improve work-life balance, or create confusion and inconsistency?

Were there any unintended consequences-positive or negative?

Lucas,

QPH is using Foundation and have implemented divisions. It works well for us. It does require additional set up, training and work for everyone. It is well worth the
additional work.. We are able to determine if a line of work is profitable beyond the gross profit number.

Hi Everyone

We have had Foundation Construction software since 2017. We have a added a second location and would like to keep up with it separately. After talking to
Foundations we have two options which is get a second data base or start using divisions. From the little bit of research that we have done, the divisions sound like a
better option.

Does any one have any experience in adding this to their company to keep up with separate locations? Also would like to add that we are thinking of adding other
locations in the future and want to make sure that this option will grow with us.

Foundation user here with 10 offices.  I'm not sure how you can create good reports without divisions!  The key is, under Accounts, to check the Apply Subdivision box
for the accounts where you will require divisions.  Last thing you want is to have this vision and then everything get booked to division 0.  Keep in mind some sort of
corporate division as well that may or may not get allocated across your other divisions once you start doing separate reporting.

Hello Andre,

Eide Bailly has a very experienced team of construction accounting professionals within our Outsourced & Managed Services (OMS) group that could assist with
workflow optimization, strategic financial leadership, and financial guidance and direction. Specifically, our OMS group has two senior managers who could be a good
fit for you. Please see their bios below. I'd be happy to connect you directly with Wesley/Mark as well as our OMS regional practice leader to further discuss how we
can be of service.

Wesley Williams has over 25 years as a trusted financial and accounting leader, with experience constructing complex financial models, budgeting and forecasting,
cash flow management, and financial reporting and analysis.  Wesley has worked with small to mid-sized companies in the construction industry (Home Building,
General Contracting and Land Development).  Wesley has helped companies to grow rapidly through strategic planning, by creating key performance indicators, and
recommending process improvements to help company leaders manage their business and increase their profits.  Wesley was instrumental in putting together funding
for real estate deals with banks and private investors and has secured working capital dollars via debt and equity.  Wesley has created AR and AP procedures that
have improved cash flow.

Mark Janz has over 35 years of experience in compliance, audit, controller, finance director and CFO positions. Mark has served in privately owned family businesses,
private equity owned companies and public companies and has interacted with teams from 5 to 5,000. The consistent theme throughout Mark's career has been
restructuring the Accounting and Finance areas to provide accurate, timely, and meaningful service to the operational areas of the company. Utilizing ERP systems and
interacting between IT teams and end users, Mark has created synergies that allow growth while managing headcount. Mark has worked for the largest Homebuilder in
Miami and smaller firms in start up mode. Mark has consolidated multiple acquisitions, taken public companies private and facilitated private equity sales. He has
worked in several industries including Homebuilding, General Contracting, Wholesale and Retail Distribution, Commercial Laundry, Property Management, and the
Entertainment/Event Industry. As CFO, Mark has been responsible for the Accounting/Finance/Tax/Audit areas in addition to managing the Human Resource, Legal,
Property Management, Risk Management, and Information Technology departments. Mark has renegotiated the relationships with the major commercial banks as well
as the local banks to ensure that their rates are competitive, and their services meet the needs of the company. Mark interprets the goals and objectives of company
leadership and applies it at a granular level to ensure that every aspect of the operation is in full alignment. Utilizing a "Finance as a service" model, Mark creates an
environment where companies can be positioned to achieve their goals while maintaining headcount, ensuring consistent and meaningful communication, and
preventing the administration aspects of a company from ever being a hindrance to success.

Thanks so much!

We are working to implement Team for our Project Managers to use. Does anyone else use this and did you find it very cumbersome to set up? We have access to the
videos in Trimble but there are NO step by step processes that I have found on how to properly set this up. When yo contact Trimble about getting help they direct you
straight to "Professional Services" and they want to charge you $250/ hour to do what I thought we were paying support for. Any insight here would be helpful.

Same Day ACH for Payroll

We are a Sage 300 user and process our payroll in house.  We generate our ACH and send typically a day or two in advance of the due date with our bank.  In some
cases if there is an error, lack of timely submitted hours or an adjustment we can do a Same Day ACH Company ID with our bank that would allow us to process a
payment and upload for same day credit for our employees.  In order to do so we have to change the DD Options settings to make that change.

How do other companies handle this?

Is there a way to create a second task of Generate Direct Deposit - Same Day so we don't have to change the options settings each time rather just select the option
we need?

Or maybe just leave the SDA Company ID in the system and process through it every time.  However the SDA option is significantly higher in fees.

We are working to implement Team for our Project Managers to use. Does anyone else use this and did you find it very cumbersome to set up? We have access to the
videos in Trimble but there are NO step by step processes that I have found on how to properly set this up. When yo contact Trimble about getting help they direct you
straight to "Professional Services" and they want to charge you $250/ hour to do what I thought we were paying support for. Any insight here would be helpful.

I have been in the SAAS consulting space for 10 years and worked for a couple of great companies. First, I will give some general advice.

When looking for your ERP, include a user or two in your demo's.  I think often I see owners, or CFO go to the demos, but then then don't think of some of the frontline
uses until implementation.  So let a key employee join and ask questions that you might not think of.
Think about your companies' long-term plans.  Will you continue to grow? Do you need an ERP that scales with you? Will you need to add different revenue streams
etc?
Will it be easy to find hires that know the system down the road?  If not, will it be easy to train.  I tend to like the high user-friendly scores for ERP's so that it is easy to



---

Will it be easy to find hires that know the system down the road?  If not, will it be easy to train.  I tend to like the high user-friendly scores for ERP's so that it is easy to
get people up to staff.

That being said there are several options for GC companies when it comes to ERP's.  Our company is a consulting firm for Sage products and Acumatica.  Both are
great for construction, but I prefer Acumatica for two reasons.  It scores very high on function vs ease of use. Second it has a great price model that scales with your
business.  If you want to look at either of these, I would be happy to discuss them with you.

When it comes to implementation, you either need the bandwidth/staff to do a lot of work yourselves, or you hire a firm.  When hiring a firm, make sure you treat it like a
construction project.  They should provide you with a SOW that covers most things.  There can always been change orders, but the top firms stay pretty close to their
original quote.  On the other hand, I see a lot of firms come with a low-ball number and then add on several change orders through out.

Most importantly though make sure you see eye to eye with the firm you choose.  Our company gets several clients a year direct from Acumatica when they fire their
original implementation teams. We are one of the go to companies for saves, in this area and have extremely high CSAT scores. Almost every time someone comes to
us this way, it was poor communication and expectations that caused the change.  I always think, would I hire this person as a direct report?  If not, then don't hire that
company as your consulting firm.

Thanks for starting this thread - it's a great question and one that many commercial GCs are navigating right now.

I'm an Account Manager at Trimble, and I work specifically with commercial contractors evaluating ERP systems. While some firms do choose to work with consultants
to manage the process, I've also seen and helped many successfully go through the selection and implementation with a strong internal team and the right vendor
partnership.

At Trimble, we support our customers with discovery workshops, ROI tools, and tailored evaluation resources, including comparisons that align with the unique needs
of commercial GCs - all at no additional cost. If you'd find it helpful, I'd be happy to share a sample evaluation project plan and talk through some best practices others
have used during their evaluations.

Feel free to reach out directly if you'd like to continue the conversation. Wishing you the best in your search - it's a big decision, and getting it right will make all the
difference long-term.

Warm regards,
Isabel Soule

Just a couple thoughts. I have been part of this process a half a dozen times for a few different types of ERPs.

First step is to develop a list of requirements. A couple different ways to go about this. 1) brainstorm with your teams 2) spend some time on some of the ERPs
websites and see what they are identifying as key items (often they will have a matrix that can be enhanced and or leveraged) and 3) In todays world use AI. A simple
ask to ChatGPT or another AI will generate a list of requirements in a couple of minutes.

Next identify the ERPs to vet. Don't try to vet all of them. Narrow it down to a max of three. Meet and go through the demoes. Include the key stakeholders from your
company. Then come together to score the different requirements. Maybe use a 1-5 rating for each requirement.

You can expand on this as you see fit but has been a good way to arrive at a selection. Then once a selection is made negotiate pricing and implementation.

Implementation can usually be done by the ERP's internal professional services teams or an outside consultant. Either avenue can be successful. The ERP will
typically be much more aggressive with this pricing than a consultant. Rule of thumb is cost for the implementation will be approx. 1-1.5x of the first year's subscription
price of the ERP. If you negotiate you will probably be pleasantly surprised that you could get it done for less than 1x the first year subscription. BUT, don't skimp here.
Don't reduce scope because you want to reduce price or the price may be easier to share with your management/board/ownership teams. Make sure you have a FULL
scope implementation and then see if you can negotiate the price down for the full scope. Often skimping or reducing scope because of price concerns only leads to re-
implementation in the future.

Hope this helps.

It has been a very long time since we looked at ERP systems, so I did want to hire a consultant to help us understand what is out there vs. where we are and what we
might think we need based on current pain points.  We've been on Sage 300 CRE for 20+ years, and while we have a bunch of third-party modules, we were looking
for a change.

Big Blue Innovations (BBI) hosted a series of software vendor events to demonstrate what the providers could do in the construction world.  It was at that point I
realized how many options there were.

I did want a consultant who would focus on our business needs from a variety of perspectives within the organization. A consultant to help guide the process from a
business needs/desires perspective, rather than watching a bunch of demos and making decisions based on shiny things the software vendors want to show.

After meeting with a handful of consultants, we did hire BBI. There was a needs assessment up front, and from there they brought back the most likely software options
to suit our needs. We have maintenance and property management in our mix, for internal and external customers, which complicated things, and wanted to automate
the labor costing through payroll in a more streamlined fashion from the end user entering time. California timekeeping requirements aren't helping us here!

We're not there yet, but I'm thankful to have them on our team to help us assemble the right combination of software and modules to best suit our needs.  I still gets
calls from software providers on payroll, expense management, etc. and I refer them to BBI to be a part of the solution we are aiming for.

Rather than chasing a generic "Top 10 KPIs" list, I'd recommend starting with a few that your team can actually measure, manage, and use to drive decisions. KPIs
aren't helpful unless they're tracked consistently, owned by someone, and tied to specific actions.

That said, here's a balanced starting point broken into key categories:



---

That said, here's a balanced starting point broken into key categories:

Financial

Gross Margin by Project

Work-in-Progress (WIP) Accuracy

Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)

Operational

Labor Productivity (or Cost-to-Earned Hour Index)

Change Order Approval Rate

Schedule Performance (Planned vs. Actual Completion)

Organizational Health

Employee Retention / Tenure Trends

Superintendent-to-Project Ratio

Training Hours or Certification Completion Rate

Risk & Safety

Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR)

Open Safety Violations / Nonconformances

If Atlas Building relies heavily on subcontractors or uses Subcontractor Default Insurance (SDI), you may also want to track:

Subcontractor Default Rate

Prequalification Pass Rate

Rework Costs or Quality Control Incidents

Before finalizing any list, ask yourself:

Can we measure this reliably?

Does it lead to action?

Does someone own it?

If the answer is "no," it's not a KPI - it's just a statistic.

I recommend the CFMA Emerging Leaders Program.

I am a graduate of the program.  Participants are CFMA members, which means while learning about leadership techniques and strategies in the program, they are
also building their network of CFPs!  The program includes large group instruction, and small group collaboration.  Program facilitators lead and guide the program
and coach participants. It's a great program!

CFMA normally offers technical education like WIP and rev rec, but this program focuses on soft skills and building leaders.  Check it out here:

I wanted to chime in because I took part in the CFMA Emerging Leaders Program, and it was one of the most impactful professional development experiences of my
career.

What sets it apart is the focus on construction financial leadership and the high caliber of participants. You're surrounded by peers who understand the same industry
challenges, and the insights and shared experiences are incredibly valuable. I left with practical strategies I could apply right away, and more importantly, a lasting
network of trusted colleagues I still connect with today.

The relationships and idea-sharing continue well beyond the program. It's more than just a course-it's a true professional community.

If you're looking for something tailored to construction leadership, I highly recommend CFMA's leadership program. Happy to share more about my experience if it's
helpful!

I have also graduated from the CFMA Emerging Leaders program and would highly recommend.  At the time I had been at my company
for 8 years and my owners gave me this wonderful opportunity to grow not only as a Controller but as a person and a leader in the
company.  This was a great way to meet others in the same place in their careers and we all lean on each other to this day if we have
something going on in our own offices and could use the advice.

We're also dragging our feet on the implementation because we don't want to pay the extra cost any sooner than we have to. We do have a lot of custom reports and
custom buttons and although Trimble assured me that they would migrate smoothly, I'm a bit skeptical.

Hi all,

Looks like it's been some time since this question was posted and would like to get updated feedback.  We remain on-prem with Vista and are dragging our feet to
migrate to the cloud.  Any advice/feedback from those who have migrated?

Appreciate it!

Cheers,

Hi Everyone - Has anyone used Mobilia Consulting, Wireless Watchdogs, or a similar company for optimizing
your company's wireless plans to reduce cost? I have started exploring the different options and I am looking to
hear from actual end users of these services.

Thanks!

CFMA,

We are a general contractor and have been steadily growing over the past few years and have been performing
larger contracted price jobs. Most of our work comes from people coming to us, but we do also bid on "open bid
style" work.  While it used to be that it might take 5-7 smaller jobs to cover our overhead, we have continued to
run our company quite lean and will sometimes land a single large job that will cover over G&A (overhead)
expenses for the year.  On these larger jobs, our typical job length is 12 months.

Here's the question: When you are confident that your gross profit on your backlog will cover your G&A
(overhead) expenses for a specific 12 month period, do you lower your bid on a project to be even more
competitive?

For example, let's say you normally bid your jobs at 10% gross profit.  If your G&A expenses are around 3% and
already fully covered for the period that the job you are bidding will be completed, would you be willing to bid the
job at 7%, to be even more competitive?

I've heard some people say "if we don't HAVE" to have the work, then we would raise our gross profit %, since we
don't need the job to survive.

Hey Jordan,

This is a classic contractor dilemma-do you lower your margins to stay competitive, or do you hold firm (or even
increase them) because you don't "need" the job?

Here's the way I see it:

Lowering your bid can keep crews busy and cash flow steady, but it also means taking on more work for
less reward. And let's be real-projects rarely go exactly as planned. One unexpected cost, and that thin
margin vanishes.
Holding your margin (or bumping it up) means fewer headaches, less risk, and higher-quality work
because you're not stretching resources too thin. Plus, it keeps your brand strong-GCs who underbid too
often can get stuck in a low-margin cycle that's tough to escape.
Smart money? Take a hybrid approach. Stay strategic about which jobs you discount, and only if they
open the door to bigger opportunities.

Either way, the key is knowing your numbers cold and making margin decisions with confidence-not
guesswork. If you're not tracking your G&A, backlog margins, and cash flow like a hawk, you're flying blind. So
the real question is-who's helping you run the numbers before you make your next big bid?

Best,

But if you want to the retainage to show as being "due" and let it age in the A/R aging report there is an option to
"release retainage".  Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to discuss further.  Good Luck!!

Good morning,

If an employee has been an employee for one year or more, when they adopt, have a baby or foster a child, the
employee can request if their job allows, to work remotely for the first six months after they have received the
child into their family, and their supervisor approves the remote work. The employee is still obligated to attend
meetings on site or as needed during this time.

John Moore

Hi Cindy,

While we haven't run into this exact issue, here is a few possible solutions that might help:

 Exclude the Retainage Invoice from Exporting – If feasible, you could set a process to manually exclude

the retainage invoice from being imported into Sage 100 to prevent double-booking.

 Use a Credit Memo – When the retainage is released and a new invoice is generated, create a credit memo

against the original retainage amount to offset the duplicate expense. This ensures the correct expense
recognition without overstating costs.



---

 Adjust via Journal Entry – Another approach is posting a journal entry when retainage is released:

Debit: Retainage Payable (to remove the liability)
Credit: Job Cost/COGS (to offset the duplicate expense)

If Trimble Pay allows customization in the export settings, that could also help streamline this process. Would be
interested to hear if others have found a different workaround!

Best,

From: Cindy DiCosola
Subject: Retainage treatment - accounting conflict

Good morning, Cafe -

We've run into an issue with the way our sub billing system (Trimble Pay) treats retainage vs our accounting
system.

When a sub submits their draw request the entire bill is entered and retainage is deducted.  When we export from
Trimble Pay to Sage 100 the entire expense is realized with the retainage held separately from the balance due.
However, when retainage is released, Trimble Pay is requiring the sub to submit a new invoice for the retainage.
If we export this invoice we will have double booked the expense for the retainage.  (I believe Textura and
Procore handle this the same way.)

How are you handling this discrepancy?  Do you just "remember" to exclude the retainage invoice from
exporting?  Do you create a Credit Memo for the previously realized retainage?

As expressed by many in this thread, the consultant is definitely the key to success of implementation. We
engaged Constuction Software Solutions (CSS) as our Acumatica consultant, and they have been engaged and
attentive from the beginning of the process. They are consultants for Acumatica exclusively and focus only on
construction which was advantageous for us during the process as they "spoke our language" as a general
contractor which helped us in meeting our aggressive four-month implementation schedule. Everyone on their
team was knowledgeable, patient, and very easy to work with during the process and continues to work
effectively with us as we continue to utilize them to seek ways that ACU can make us even more efficient and
knowledgeable about our business.

I have a client that has been going through an Acumatica implementation and is very frustrated.  They are a
general contractor for large company retail sites as well as facilities maintenance.  They are moving from
QuickBooks Desktop. The implementation has been going on for about 15 months and they are still finding things
that don't work in the software, are frustrated with the need to change how they do things to conform to
Acumatica versus making the software work for them, and they are still in Phase One.  They are supposed to go
live February 1st but don't feel that the software is ready.  If you've implemented Acumatica for your business and
are happy with it, I'd love to hear your experience and how you ensured a smooth implementation.

We need to implement some automation in our AP function to keep up with the volume of invoices received daily (~50/day, 1,000/mo), but I think we are limited due to
the platforms we use (Comsense for our doors division and ProContractor for glass, flooring and specialties).  Any recommendations for AP automation that may

This includes additional metrics (some overlap).

Metric

Typical Target Range

Notes

Gross Profit Margin
Operating Profit Margin
Net Profit Margin

Current Ratio
Quick Ratio

Debt-to-Equity Ratio
Interest Coverage Ratio

10% – 20%
3% – 10%
2% – 8%

1.2 – 2.0
1.0 – 1.5

0.5 – 1.5
4.0+

Higher for specialty contractors (electrical, HVAC) than GCs.
5%+ is generally strong in construction.
After all expenses, including taxes.

Higher ratio = safer liquidity; above 2.0 might mean idle cash.
Strips out inventory and WIP assets for stricter liquidity.

1.0 or lower is preferred by sureties for bonding purposes.
4x EBIT coverage shows low debt burden.

Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) 45 – 75 days
30 – 60 days
Accounts Payable Turnover
1.0x – 2.0x
Backlog to Annual Revenue

Lower is better; over 75 days may indicate collection problems.
Paying suppliers faster maintains good relationships.
Enough work under contract to cover next 12–24 months is ideal.

WIP Profit Fade
Overbillings/Underbillings

0% – (−2%)
Balanced or slight overbilling Overbilling improves cash flow; chronic underbilling can be risky.

Small fade (loss of estimated profits) is tolerable; large fade is a warning.

Operating Cash Flow
Cash Flow to Revenue Ratio
Return on Assets (ROA)

Positive
5% – 10%
5% – 10%

Always critical; negative operating cash flow is a major red flag.
Stronger for contractors with government or large private clients.
Construction is asset-heavy (equipment, vehicles).

Return on Equity (ROE)

10% – 20%

Investors want double-digit returns if possible.

Hello, VP of Finance of a $140+M company. The owner wants me and 1 other team member to take a leadership course that is based more so around construction
leaders so we can better serve our teams.

Has anybody had any good experiences with any? I cannot seem to find many that fit this criteria. Breslin has a leadership circle, for 4 days in the desert, that seems
like it is my best bet for now but the reviews are iffy and 4 days in a desert isn't the most appealing. It does not have to be a travel course I am open to anything really.

I've taken Ted's workshops and have also brought him in house to work with our leadership team. He has 30-year construction background, leading billion dollar
projects. Now does coaching for a living. Great fit and strongly recommend.

Hello, VP of Finance of a $140+M company. The owner wants me and 1 other team member to take a leadership course that is based more so around construction
leaders so we can better serve our teams.

Has anybody had any good experiences with any? I cannot seem to find many that fit this criteria. Breslin has a leadership circle, for 4 days in the desert, that seems
like it is my best bet for now but the reviews are iffy and 4 days in a desert isn't the most appealing. It does not have to be a travel course I am open to anything really.
Thanks in advance!!

Cody, I am a controller of a small general contractor, but served in the role of CFO of larger construction firms before retirement. I am now also a certified business
coach. I am not asking you to engage me but I know some excellent business coaches who specialize in leadership as one of their core competencies. The program
you mention is most likely a package where every enrollee receives pretty much the same training. The coaches I would refer you to will train you based on your goals,
strengths and weaknesses and will guide you to the outcome you choose to create rather than one designed for the masses.

CFMA has a very robust leadership program called Emerging Leaders. I went through the Emerging Leaders Program a few years ago, and it was honestly a game-
changer for me. Over the course of the program, I got to dive deep into my leadership style, work with amazing coaches, and connect with a group of driven, like-
minded people in the construction world; who I still keep in touch with to this day. The program focuses on managing difficult situations (and people), gaining self
awareness, and what it looks like to invest in others and build a thriving team. If you're looking to level up, build real confidence, and grow your network, I can't
recommend it enough! CFMA recently opened the application period but it closes on May 30th so I definitely encourage you to check it out and apply. See the below
link to find out more info and apply.

Before looking at change I would do an ROI analysis on Procore. I did this several years ago for a GC looking at purchasing Procore. The productivity savings was
greater than the price so it was a no-brainer. Do the options mentioned offer greater ROI than Procore currently provides?

Hello,

We're currently using Procore, but as our sales volume is expected to increase over the next few years, we're becoming increasingly concerned about potential fee
hikes due to Procore's pricing model being tied to annual revenue.

To proactively evaluate our options, we're considering other platforms and would love to hear from anyone who has compared Procore with:

Autodesk Construction Cloud

Trimble (e-Builder, ProjectSight)

CMiC

Oracle Aconex / Primavera

If you've assessed these platforms from a cost standpoint, ballpark figures or even just major cost-related pros/cons would be helpful.

Thanks!

Hello Takanori,

We have many inquiries about PROCORE, and companies are looking at alternatives. What ERP/Accounting solution are you integrating with today? How much of the
PROCORE stack do you all use?

We are an Acumatica Gold Partner in Real Estate Development, Construction, and Property Management. In addition to Acumatica's Construction Project
Management modules, we integrate with PROCORE, STACK (Estimation), and Job Planner (which has been a very competitive conversation for PROCORE).

Depending on the size of your Construction Management team and the amount of functionality they require from a business technology solution, we have found that
companies that have used PROCORE for longer than three years, those team members do not want to change. However, there are more competent solutions at a
much lower cost.

For example, you note that Autodesk Cloud is another solution that integrates with many of the more popular ERP Construction Accounting Solutions.

Let me know if you would like more information on JobPlanner and Stack. If you require professional services, we have worked with some very good integrated service
providers to integrate PROCORE and AudoDesk.

Hi Courtney,

Sage 300 CRE and Sage Intacct Construction handle your need for project specific cost codes a bit differently, but both can handle the use case.  I am at CFMA
National this week so if you are at the conference please stop by the booth and ask for me or Tanya Eney and we can walk you through the options.  If you are not at
the big show I would be happy to set up some time next week to walk through some of the options.

As for the AP Invoice entry screen, I would love to get a detail review of your experience.  The new technology allows us to do things we could never do with 300 CRE
but we can always make it better...

Sorry about the delay in the response.

I am going through the implementation process for Sage Intacct, switching from Sage 300 CRE.  We are starting to find that it might not be a good fit for us because
Intacct doesn't seem to have great project management capabilities.  We were already hesitant because of the price tag, then we had to get Miter for payroll, and now
we are being told that we would need a third party like Procore for project management.

In Sage 300, we create job-specific cost codes to track changes in scope.  I was told by our implementation team that they have never seen this and we need to have
unique cost codes and descriptions.  If we continue to create these change related cost codes, we would have to do the job number dash COR number to keep it
unique.  We would also have to have a unique description - for example, we can't use "upgraded fixtures" or "added eye wash" on more than one cost code
description.  I have never worked for another construction company, so I don't have anything else to compare it to, but I was surprised to hear they didn't have a
suggestion for tracking costs to changes - especially time & material.

I suppose my question or purpose for the post is pretty broad.

I'd love some advice and/or reviews from those familiar with Intacct - we don't love the AP entry compared to Sage 300 either.

Hello,

We implemented Briq starting in Q4 last year. There were some challenges with implementation and slow progress on the project (digital worker for AP Automation).
However, Bassem and the team really stepped up and made it right (gave us an extension on the subscription). We are also using Briq for Amex receipts workflow and
Risk Management.

I highly recommend re-trying Briq if it failed in the past. They seem to have some good, solid teams now.

Thank you,

We tried to use Briq for AP automation.  After 5 Implementation Lead changes (they had a lot of turnover) and a year without getting the implantation in place, we gave
up.   They only offered an extension of time at renewal and NO REFUND of the investment.

Something that shows risk level, financial strength, credit recommendations, etc.

Re: Viewpoint Spectrum Calculation of Weighted Overtime Pay

Daniel,

Along with how the average weighted rate is calculated, other critical concerns are: 1) accurate hours tracking and determination of overtime. 2) Accurate hourly rate
assignments, and 3) Inclusion of additional non-discretionary earnings.  cannot provide legal advice though would be happy to have a conversation to review the
Spectrum calculation. Below is information I provided to an ADP client that I was concerned was not fully understanding their situation and were likely at risk.

Under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), all remuneration for employment, including on call earnings, must be included in the regular
rate of pay when calculating overtime.

For additional guidance on this matter, the U.S. Department of Labor provides several resources:

Fact Sheet #56A: Overview of the Regular Rate of Pay Under the FLSA: U.S. Department of Labor (This document outlines
what constitutes the regular rate of pay and emphasizes the inclusion of commissions in overtime calculations)

Fact Sheet #23: Overtime Pay Requirements of the FLSA: U.S. Department of Labor (Includes the entry below and the
"regular rate" is not the employee's base rate):

The regular rate includes all remuneration for employment except certain payments excluded by the Act itself. Payments which are not
part of the regular rate include pay for expenses incurred on the employer's behalf, premium payments for overtime work or the true
premiums paid for work on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, discretionary bonuses, gifts and payments in the nature of gifts on special



---

premiums paid for work on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, discretionary bonuses, gifts and payments in the nature of gifts on special
occasions, and payments for occasional periods when no work is performed due to vacation, holidays, or illness. Earnings may be
determined on a piece-rate, salary, commission, or some other basis, but in all such cases the overtime pay due must be computed on
the basis of the average hourly rate derived from such earnings.

We are looking to implement weighted overtime pay in Spectrum and I wanted to see if anyone else has compared the calculation from
Spectrum to the FLSA requirements.  If so, what are your thoughts and feedback?  I am not convinced the two calculations align.  Is
there something we are missing?

We stopped subscribing to D&B years ago - they are not designed for Construction and all of our reports do not reflect the truth. There are a number of
reporting agencies that ARE designed for Construction and over the last 20 years, they are more recognized & accepted.  I would check those out & pick the one that
suits you best.

Dear all,

We recently had a potential client question our Dun & Bradstreet delinquency score. Upon contacting D&P, I learned that the payment volume being reporting is
extremely low but all the rep wanted to focus on was selling me the D&B Concierge service.

Anyone willing to share how they manage the D&B reporting or if you pay for any services? Thank you in advance!

 PCORI Fee Reminder – Payment Due by July 31

Self-funded employers and HRAs must calculate and submit their PCORI fee with IRS Form 720. The amount changes annually based on covered lives. Employers
with fully insured plans generally do not need to file, as carriers handle it.

Does anyone have insights into recent IRS guidance on PCORI fee calculations? Always happy to help if you need clarification.

Hello, VP of Finance of a $140+M company. The owner wants me and 1 other team member to take a leadership course that is based more so around construction
leaders so we can better serve our teams.

Has anybody had any good experiences with any? I cannot seem to find many that fit this criteria. Breslin has a leadership circle, for 4 days in the desert, that seems
like it is my best bet for now but the reviews are iffy and 4 days in a desert isn't the most appealing. It does not have to be a travel course I am open to anything really.
Thanks in advance!!

Cost Comparison Alternatives to Procore – Concern About Fee Increases

May 20, 2025 12:13 PM

Takanori Kakishita

Hello,

We're currently using Procore, but as our sales volume is expected to increase over the next few years, we're becoming increasingly concerned about potential fee
hikes due to Procore's pricing model being tied to annual revenue.

To proactively evaluate our options, we're considering other platforms and would love to hear from anyone who has compared Procore with:

Autodesk Construction Cloud

Trimble (e-Builder, ProjectSight)

CMiC

Oracle Aconex / Primavera

If you've assessed these platforms from a cost standpoint, ballpark figures or even just major cost-related pros/cons would be helpful.

Thanks!

As a follow up to Rob's comments above. I have attached a brief high level overview of our solution. If anyone would like to set up a call to discuss what we can deliver
please use my contact information below.

Additionally, I am happy to help anyone looking for NetSuite contacts across North America. Accounts executives are broken down by company revenue buckets,
geographic regions, and industries. At the Oracle booth at the show is Taylor Stumpf, taylor.stumpf@oracle.com who helps lead the NetSuite Associations group. If you
have any questions NetSuite related you can talk to her and some solution consultants at the Oracle booth during the conference.

As we build up our presence in North America, we are hoping that ProScope will begin to exhibit at the Regional and National conferences. We look forward to many
discussions and continued friendships as we make ourselves more of a presence with CFMA.

Talk to you soon!

Cheers,

Will

Good afternoon.  I am a construction lawyer in Miami (and longtime CFMA member) and many of our clients use it and seem to like it a lot.  They tell me about the
ability to better track their materials as well as getting more competitive quotes (therefore saving money).  I have not heard of anyone not renewing, which would
appear to be a good sign that it is worth the price.  Hope I answered your question.

I appreciate your feedback. Both of these programs are on my short list, and I am learning more about Rogers (UWorld). Many reviewers refer to the delivery of its
content and detailed explanations of practice problems when listing their preferences over Becker's platform, and both programs claim similar exam pass rates.

It seems I cannot make a bad choice between these two programs, so I may opt for the lower cost option.

As a recruiter specifically focused on the construction sector, this is a very prominent discussion with many of our
clients at the moment. I appreciate seeing the various statements. I would ditto Dan Brown's comments. That is
what we are generally seeing. There are nuances for each market and company of course.

Historically, construction companies have had an 'ostrich approach' - keeping things the same and just bonusing
more to overcome market uncertainty by keeping overhead low and sharing known proceeds. This has some
unintended consequences, mostly when retaining and recruiting. Veteran employees may get used to the bonus
making up for what becomes below market wages... but there is a point where they no longer see the bonus as a
bonus... and more of an 'owed income'. Thus, can quickly deteriorate the aligned culture of rewarding for
performance. Concurrently, this hurts recruiting - as management is less willing to pay new incoming employees
the current true market rate... as that would then pay greenhorns close to what their long-time veterans are being
paid. Incoming employees are even less likely to count future bonuses towards their total compensation.

So that is what NOT to do.

Whereas, what Dan Brown is sharing and the discussion with Wendy and Michael are fostering is very
encouraging and aligned. Great seeing this thread and keep the good ideas flowing. I'm happy to connect with
anyone directly looking to discuss their current company's scenario specifically.

"We offer 20% base for the controller role. All other finance positions are purely discretionary however, we target
giving everyone between 5%-10% of base if company financial performance allows"

Hi Michael - Nice to meet a fellow financial professional from Iowa!

We recently completed our budgeting process at Acterra Group, located in Marion, IA, and we budgeted
increases of 3% and 5% for direct and indirect labor roles, respectively. Given the competition among direct labor
roles, we decided to prioritize that group over back office roles.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss further.

We just assisted in a cloud migration for a company with many customizations, one of which was built by a former employee and couldn't be repointed to the cloud (so we had to get
creative). There was definitely work to do, but the process is much smoother than it was a few years ago. One of the company's users said that he thought it operated at the same speed as
on-prem. Planning and testing made the migration relatively smooth. So it mainly comes down to the financial terms of the contract in my opinion.

Hello,

We are a prime contractor looking at a particular county bid job in Colorado which looks very promising. We have never bid in Colorado before, however--I am wondering if any of you are
aware of any special requirements to submit a bid in Colorado from an out-of-state Contractor? The contract docs don't appear to require a CO contractor's license, but we've seen other
states that require additional dues, payments, or requirements.

Am very grateful for any who are able to respond!

Does insurance coverage start when you request a COI, when you sign the contract, or when you put boots on
the ground?  Is it universal or does it vary by policy or carrier?

I try to keep it simple, but this has worked for our company for over 25 years:

We format the codes like this - #-

The first 2 digits are the "Department" code:  00 for Balance Sheet, 01 for Direct Job Costs, 02 for Indirect Job Costs, 03 for Direct Equipment Costs, 04 for Indirect Shop/Equipment Costs,
05 for G&A.

The last 4 digits are the GL account number, which could probably be the same GL account numbers you use currently.

Janna - I do this work as a part of my data process and flow offering.   I would be glad to show you some different ways to set up your COA for this purpose, as well as designing your
reporting to easily determine whether you are under or overapplied on your equipment costs.

Another key is a discussion of crosswalk tables and reports so that you do not lose prior year comparability. .

Any finally, it is an opportunity to better track revenue and gross profit margin by type of business, PM etc

Let me know if you want to discuss.

Take care - Brigid

Hi Janna,

I have always found that less is more when it comes to GL accounts.  In my experience when you have too many GL accounts it creates confusion and you lose consistency and data
integrity.

I set-up Job Cost accounts  and use:

   WIP Labor

   WIP Burden

   WIP Materials

   WIP Equipment

   WIP Sub-Contracts

   WIP Fuel

   WIP Other

With in our ERP any direct expenses require a  job number, cost code and category.   The category (L, B, M, S, O, F) drives the GL account automatically.

For equipment cost I follow a similar format of :

   Eq. Labor

   Eq Burden

   Eq. Parts

  Eq. Outside Repairs

  Eq. Fuel



---

  Eq. Other

  Eq. Depreciation

Any items charged to equipment require an equipment number and eq. repair code/category.  In this case the repair category drives the GL account automatically.

I set-up a construction OH job and a shop OH job to capture indirect costs, allocations, etc.

We have a fairly standard SG&A expense accounts set-up for general OH.

Hope this helps.

I've attached a chart of accounts that I've used in the past for a similar contractor. As others have said, keep it as simple as possible to create the desired reporting level. Too many accounts
will create confusion. In the attached template, we had separate accounts for direct and indirect job cost and equipment costs. This is so that all of the indirect costs can be allocated to the
jobs or equipment as necessary to better understand the profitability of jobs and equipment. Capturing the fully burdened cost of the jobs and equipment can lead to better decision making.
If you have all of the data captured, pulling this into an equipment dashboard like the one shown below can give high level view of profitability by equipment category.

This chart of accounts format can be expanded to XXXX-01, etc. for divisional P&Ls if needed.

Our ERP Sage Contractor 100 has a "T&M Compute" function that takes any job costs posted to a job, applies markup and that is what we use for Earned Revenue at year end in our WIP.
The amount is booked as "billed ahead".  We file on an accrual basis.  I hope that helps!

We are a small construction company. Most of our jobs are Cost Plus construction management. We have a fairly large job right now and will be purchasing and putting deposits on

I don't know if this will be help as it isn't traditional training. If you work with a CPA firm, I recommend you speak with them. See if they will offer a training session(s). Maybe a monthly close
where they assist and train. Our accountants have a specific service they offer that is training based and often when the individual wants to learn they can become self-sufficient and
knowledgeable of their responsibilities but also the industry. It allows for the training to be gear specific to your business and the way your software and books are currently structured. They
offer inhouse and remote.

I don't know if this will be help as it isn't traditional training. If you work with a CPA firm, I recommend you speak with them. See if they will offer a training session(s). Maybe a monthly close
where they assist and train. Our accountants have a specific service they offer that is training based and often when the individual wants to learn they can become self-sufficient and
knowledgeable of their responsibilities but also the industry. It allows for the training to be gear specific to your business and the way your software and books are currently structured. They
offer inhouse and remote.

the catalyst of construction accounting.

We also use Spectrum but decided not to upgrade to TC1 at this time. Based on a recommendation from another electrical contractor in Houston, as Melissa Chapman mentioned, we
started using Paperless Pay about a month ago. The transition has been smooth, and employees have found it very user-friendly. With a workforce ranging from 275 to 300 employees at
any given time, we found the pricing to be significantly more cost-effective. While I'd like to upgrade eventually to take advantage of the additional features offered by the HR modules in
TC1, it's not a priority for us right now.

I am looking into solutions to provide our employees' with electronic pay stubs and/or to set up an employee portal for the employees to access the paystubs.

What solutions have you found easy to use for both employer and employee as well as cost effective?

We currently use Viewpoint Spectrum, which does offer an employee portal solution, but seems a bit pricey to me.  Comments on experience with the Viewpoint Spectrum portal are
welcome as well.

We have established a policy that any credit card transactions that cannot be "proven"(i.e. receipts) will be the responsibility of the employee. If they don't provide the receipt we will deduct
the charge from their paycheck. I only had to do it a couple of times and that got almost everyone (president and VP excluded) to turn them in as requested. One thing that really helped
before we switched ERPs was a software program that allowed them to take a photo of the receipt and code it in the app. the convenience of that worked well for them. Our new ERP
doesn't have that type of program but we still encourage them to take pictures and send or save them so that when we request them they have them available.

Not looking for any new software - so this isn't a sales question...

What do you do if receipts are NOT turned in? Most of my Supers and Foreman are good about at least trying to get me their receipts every week or two, I can deal with that. However, for
the few that just flat out refuse to even attempt to turn them in - I need to put something in writing as a policy so it can be reviewed at our next field meeting and then I can take further action
from there. Suggestions? Curious about what has worked well for others, I know this is a pain for most of us.

Texas law actually prohibits this practice without written authorization from the employee assuming they used your business card to make the expense. If they are using their personal card
and requesting reimbursement, that's different (you are withholding the reimbursement, not deducting wages). I'm not a lawyer so take my advice with a grain of salt, but you may want to
review Section 61.018 of the labor code. Specifically, this point:

Sec. 61.018. DEDUCTION FROM WAGES. An employer may not withhold or divert any part of an employee's wages unless the employer:

(1) is ordered to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction;

(2) is authorized to do so by state or federal law; or
(3) has written authorization from the employee to deduct part of the wages for a lawful purpose.

That helps, but it still ends up being a bit complex which is why we don't recommend it. For example, under federal law, wage deductions cannot bring an employee's pay below the federal
minimum wage unless the deduction is for the employee's benefit (e.g., health insurance, uniform costs).

If you've already run the practice by your employment lawyer, great! If not, I'd recommend it. We have a great one at Outpave that I can refer you to that's Texas based. What you don't want
to have happen is end up in court fighting a legal situation over a simple receipt compliance issue when you could have just let the person go (i.e. a 3 strikes and you are out rule).

Before we implemented the procedure, I was told that it was approved by the attorney, but I was not a part of that conversation myself. It's definitely something I will bring up at our next
meeting. Now we have another accounting person that is able to spend more time "tracking down" all of the receipts so it hasn't been an issue for us in a while. Thanks for the information,
though. We definitely want to make sure we are in compliance on this.

When I was the controller for a multi-state drywall and masonry company, we implemented Rhumbix for time tracking at 4 locations.  The implementation was incredibly smooth, and I
thoroughly enjoyed working with the implementation team (how many times can you say that).  Our payroll processing time went from over two days to three hours on Monday mornings.
 At times we had over two hundred employees in the field at several locations and tracked time by job, cost code and sometimes even the location on the job.  Training for employees who
were responsible for entering their time and field supers responsible for approving time was fairly simple although it did require bringing the guys in in small groups for hands on training to
accomplish this.  (Just part of the construction industry I guess - some more tech savvy than others.)  I can't exactly remember, but I believe start to finish, it took about a month to
accomplish set up (uploading jobs and cost codes) and integration with Viewpoint.  The payroll was uploaded via a file on Monday mornings for review and processing by the centralized
payroll department.  Again, a straightforward and easy process.   Rhumbix software accommodated the growth of Manganaro and is still being used today at over eight locations on
hundreds of projects.  The multi-lingual feature was also a big factor in getting the employees to use the app, especially in certain areas of the country.  I can't emphasize enough too; how
great their implementation staff was to work with.  I'm currently working on an API currently with Sage and another major player in construction software and it has not gone very smoothly.
One of the first things I look for when choosing a software vendor now is their support staff.  Best of luck.  If I can answer any further questions, please feel free to reach out.

We are looking to have a custom report created in ProContractor.  The reports intended use is to be viewed by our project management team on a monthly basis.  I believe the custom

A workflow with DocuSign and compliance might tie everything off nicely.  We are heavy compliance users to track information.

I understand that many construction companies close for 1-2 weeks during the December holidays. If your
company follows this practice, do salaried employees receive their regular pay, or do they need to use PTO
during the shutdown? There are some basic guidelines from the Department of Labor on this but a lot of it seems
to be left up to the employer.

Is anyone on this forum using Paychex as their 401k provider? Their quote beats my current provider by 20 bps,
but my advisors have some concerns about their performance as a record keeper.

I am forming a group of interested CFMA members that are interested in discussing, would you be interested as
you do it as we do it currently.  We are considering not making PM's and their team fill out time cards but I then
fear we will lose the tracking component.  Please let me know and thank you for the information.

I agree, the Finvari platform is fantastic! We have been using Finvari for over a year and I highly recommend it.
Their dashboard along with the automatic reminders for the users make it so much easier to keep track of all
activity (we can have anywhere between 300-400 line items per week). You can easily identify who needs to
upload a receipt, code, approve, etc. When importing to Vista, the receipts are automatically attached to the
invoice and our AP and payment posting batches always match the Finvari statement.

I'd also like to note that for online purchases the cardholder can forward or have the receipt directly emailed to
their unique Finvari card email and the receipt will automatically be matched with the transaction.

We have no regrets.

Best of luck!

Hey Brittany,

We moved to Finvari a couple of years ago.  The platform is fantastic.  It is super easy to use for non-tech people
but there are a ton of controls/configuration options for anything that you will want to do.  It integrates with our
ERP (Vista) in real time adding phases and jobs as they are added to Vista.  I'm assuming they have the same
integration with CE, but you will want to confirm.  If they do, you should definitely check it out before making a
final decision.

Good luck!

Hey Conner,

Typically, I would recommend tying the documentation for a customer into your CRM by Job/Project. While you
can set this up in Sharepoint, there are nice to have features in a CRM. Do you have one setup today?  If you
were to do this in Sharepoint, I would recommend this structure.



---

were to do this in Sharepoint, I would recommend this structure.

Customer # or Name -> Project/Job # or Name

If you want one step further, you could add in Document type (Quote, Contract, Complete). This would be similar
to a deal workflow in a CRM. Are you also storing your job photos inside this sharepoint site or do you use a
different system for it? How were you planning to use Power Automate? Are the customers or jobs setup in
another system today (i.e. you'd automate creating the folder structure in sharepoint)?

The big challenge you may find is that your employees don't stick to the process. If you can bring the data
creation as close to the process as possible, it will be easier to follow. For example, if you could automate
creating the templates your team would use in that folder structure so all they have to do is edit the files, then
you'll have something that is followed 95% of the time.

Hi all, looking to see what your best practices are for maintaining an organized document naming system.

We are a sub-contractor with 2 types of customers: 1) the builder, whom we may be working with multiple
homeowners through, and 2) the direct-to-homeowner for remodels.

We are finding it challenging to create a standard naming convention to track quotes, sales contracts, project cost
sheets, etc. to the right job (and to either the correct builder or direct-to-homeowner). We are implementing
Adobe Sign, Power Automate, and SharePoint to maintain this more efficiently. As we implement this, I want to
make sure we create our standard naming conventions for the best organization possible for our documents.

Thanks in advance!

If you're looking to keep it simple, I have used and are using this processs for our job files.  Each folder is a job.
Each job folder contains subfolder to separate out our invoices, contract, subcontracts, materials, etc.  Within
each folder, the documents can be named with the type of document such as:

Submittal = SBMTL-xxx

Quote = Q-xxx

Purchase Orders = PO xxx

Letter = LTR-xxx

Transmittal = TSMTL-xxx

with the xxx being a short but more descriptive text about the contents for the document, e.g.: Q-Anchor Fence

Hope this helps.

I would add that having the customer number to start is a great idea. If you do not yet have a project number, you
can use a file renamer tool to quickly edit all the files for that project later when the job is created.

David Cauthron

How often are employees utilizing their vehicle for the company? If it's a couple of times per month, mileage
reimbursement is very common. It's what I would recommend vs adding a company vehicle or fuel card.

If they are utilizing a personal vehicle for company purposes on a daily basis, that's a different story. I'd
recommend a fuel card and company vehicle.

The challenge is that the IRS doesn't compensate for wear and tear on a personal vehicle at a job site (nails in
tires, rocks, dents/dings, etc) or for larger vehicles (i.e. F250s and up). The administrative headache on you
would be a bit of a nightmare. You'd be constantly reviewing distance, compliance with IRS policy (i.e. home to
work, work to home aren't included), seeing abuse (let me add a few extra miles or oops, I included that run to
the grocery store from the jobsite to pickup chicken for dinner).

With a corporate vehicle, you also have more visibility and control. You can install things to track vehicle milage
and location automatically. You can tie those into your fuel card so you can see mileage and fuel usage
automatically. You can ensure speed limits are followed. You can brand the vehicle so your marketing is shown
everywhere they drive. While it does cost more, you also have a lot more flexibility. With a fuel card, you can get
discounts at the pump that help reduce costs.

Hope this helps!

We are Vista customers and are using Preferred Strategies data models for Vista.  We have been on it for
approx. 3 years.  It is a good product.  I have expressed to them that the out of the box reports need to be more
robust.  I think they have done a better job in recent years trying to develop this.  The only draw back is that every
time they update the models, it comes at a cost.  Nevertheless, their data models are good and allow companies
to create custom Power BI reports that corrolate data fairly well.  If you are a novice at Power BI it is a good
product, however if you have Power BI experience I think it would be an even better product to use within your
firm.

Hey Megan!

What we've found is manual processes just do not work unless you have consequences. For example, you give
up to 3 warnings prior to turning off the card for a week. However, the challenge is that this is a waste of
resources both on the employee and manager. We'd rather have the team focused on making money vs tracking
expenses.

What we have done with Outpave (similar to Expensify, but tailor made for construction) is enabled the employee
to see the transaction the moment they swipe their card. It is a lot easier to remember to take the receipt if you
receive a notification to do so right when it happens. Once that picture is uploaded to Outpave, you can throw
that receipt away. I've seen far too many contractors have receipts stuffed all over their truck waiting to be turned
in, and I have no idea how they manage it. One company had their GM writing the allocations manually on the
receipts so they knew which project it went to for each purchase. With Outpave, we allow them to allocate it right
when the receipt is uploaded.

If you are interested, let me know! I'll show you what we can do. Either way, I'd recommend trying to get the
process more real time. Have the employee take a picture of the receipt right when the purchase is made. If you
can take it digital vs paper, it'll lower the burden on the entire team and smooth out the process.

We use Corpay^ (Comdata) credit cards and use the Expense Track app (and web version) on mobile devices for
employees to take pictures of receipts as they make purchases, and the receipt automatically matches to the
charge once it is posted so the employee can then code and submit for approval. Because we have a weekly
cycle (Sun-Sat) most employees process their receipts daily or at the time of purchase and follow-up with coding
and submitting but the following Monday so the charges can be approved. By Wed/Thur AP validates all charges
are submitted/approved and then post to our ERP (Vista) with attachments. If someone fails to comply their card

Hey Paul - Just curious, if you receive the receipt data from Corpay, why do you still want the images on
receipts? One of the things we would like to do is eliminate receipts all together. This would assume we can get
100% of receipt data and generate them for you.

Subject: Successful Practices: Missing Receipts

We use Corpay^ (Comdata) credit cards and use the Expense Track app (and web version) on mobile devices for
employees to take pictures of receipts as they make purchases, and the receipt automatically matches to the
charge once it is posted so the employee can then code and submit for approval. Because we have a weekly
cycle (Sun-Sat) most employees process their receipts daily or at the time of purchase and follow-up with coding
and submitting but the following Monday so the charges can be approved. By Wed/Thur AP validates all charges
are submitted/approved and then post to our ERP (Vista) with attachments. If someone fails to comply their card
is suspended until they comply. We rarely have missing receipts. We also get rebates from Corpay^ based on our
spend. We have over 500 credit cards.

At my last job, I was having difficulty with receipts as well.  Credit card charges were processed month and if
receipts were missing, the employee was given a warning.  After two warnings, the card was shut off.  I didn't
reactivate the card until the employee asked me.  Some preferred to use their own card and would submit
receipts.  I only reimbursed charges made on their personal card once a month.

Thanks Kevin!

At Anterra, we've been supporting construction companies' dashboard and BI analytics needs for almost 20 years
with our Sage 300 CRE SQL replicator tool. If you haven't yet invested in building Power BI dashboards internally,
I would take a look at Anterra's Corporate Performance Management platform as this solves for 90% of the
average commercial construction companies' reporting needs out of the box.

I am on the Professional Services team here at Anterra, where we work with clients to accomplish that remaining
10% by capturing each client's unique needs. Happy to chat should you have any questions.

Sarah,

Do you know if you're using the SQL replicator to replicate the Sage 300 CRE data from the Pervasive database
to a SQL database? Without replicating to SQL, it might be difficult to build a Power BI dashboard that refreshes
automatically, based on the discussion here. If your data is replicated to SQL then it's a fairly standard
deployment to build Power BI dashboards on it. You could look at providers such as Pronovos or Anterra as
possible options as well.

Good Morning,

There has been great value in the ERP round table with Jay Synder for our community!  I am having challenges
with our service software and integrations and wonder if there is interest in the same exercises where contractors
control the conversation and provide honest feedback focused on service.

We have found that service software works great for small business but not medium to large and seem to be
caught in re-evaluating another provider.

I would like a round table to include

1) Oracle Field Service

2) FieldBoss

3) BuildOPs

4) Jobber

5) FieldPoint

I think this would be very well attended.  Nearly every ERP project we assist with for contractors with a service
component includes detailed work for determining their Service Management software requirements which may
be met with an all-in-one ERP but more often requires a second solution that integrates to their tech stack.
Happy to assist with this if desired.  Our ERP Roundtable Series actually starts off with a "contractor only"
session where we do virtual breakout rooms for contractors to share perspectives and experiences.  When you
talk about Service Management it ultimately also includes discussions about time keeping, warehouse/inventory
management, a client portal, dispatch, etc.  We find that they are excellent, meaty discussions.

Your list is pretty comprehensive.  Another solution not on this list that should be included is Service Trade.  Note,
we are not a reseller or referral partner to any tech so I am not trying to position or prop up any particular
software provider.

Best.

We are currently on CMiC and recently bought BuildOps, but having too many challenges not to pursue another

I am hoping to either elevate BuildOps so it is functional for our purpose or change in Q1 2025.

I'll add a couple of other things from a "surety" perspective that David touched on.



---

When companies and their shareholders have excess cash (which is another topic of what is truly "free
cash"), there are times where a surety will agree to forego the need for a bank line, provided you have a
stable business track record (financial results, management, business plan, etc.). To the earlier points,
consult with your surety agent and surety company about what they feel comfortable with in conjunction
with what you and your management team feel comfortable with.
I typically advise contractors (especially sub-trades) to have a bank line that will aid in cash flowing
whatever your retentions may be at a given point in time. There is always lag in payment of retentions (job
delays, quantity discussions, change orders, etc.) and you will want your line to be available to cash flow
these timing differences strategically. I also advise my clients to price in the use of any bank line (or lower
interest return on cash reserves) into any estimate.

From: David McGraw
Subject: Line of credit

There has been good feedback in this string.  The amount of bank line is dependent on a number of factors, such
as the following:

·         How much does your company need or use during the busy time of year?  The line should be well in

excess of that.  As the Surety, we want to see a cushion to allow funds to cover a job that may go bad.  If
the company is growing, cash flow can be stressed covering increased retainage etc.
·         As was pointed out, how much does the company qualify for with their primary bank?
·         I like the post of 10% of revenues, but again it needs to be more than usage.  If a company never uses

their line for operations, the Surety is likely fine with a smaller line, and in the case of 17MM of revenues,
1MM would be minimal.

·         The Surety also likes to know that the line rests for some part of the year, or maybe some long-term

financing should be put in place to allow for a resting period.

·         If a smaller line is in place and the contractor gets a much larger job than normal, the surety may request

a "job specific" line be put in place separate from the base LOC.

Good input everyone

Hi Gene,

In a previous life as a controller for a Division 8 Glass Company that deployed EOS/Great Game of Business,
one metric my team and I were responsible for was the 'Interest Expense'. With a Line of Credit, it was up to my
fellow teammates and I to manage cash to the best of our ability and what came out of it was an expansion of
tools we had within our ERP system that weren't being utilized previously. Although it technically stepped across
multiple departments, one thing we implemented was a 'Expected Delivery Date' on our PO's. This offered me
more insight on when I would need cash based up delivery time, when I would receive a Vendor Invoice, and
when that invoice would eventually need to be paid. In combination with our accounting team managing collection
activities, together, we could make a significant impact on how much we would use/not use the line of credit and
thus trim an overhead expense.

I hope that was helpful! Although I offered one example, feel free to send me an email on how that team or
individual can be responsible for that figure for the company and I would be happy to expand.

Hi Mark,

3 years ago I made the switch from public accounting to being a controller for a construction company.  One tool
that I found value in was "The New Controller Guidebook" by Steven Bragg.  This is not construction industry
specific, but was still helpful for me. Reading through this books didn't introduce me to too many "new" ideas or
concepts, but rather just reinforced that I already have 95% of the knowledge that I needed, giving me the
confidence that I needed.  There is a section in the first few pages that is titled "The New Controller Checklist"
which includes who the controller needs to talk with right a way to gain some understandings of key areas such
as receivables, payables, debt payments, and reconciliation.  Then describes some key ratios, cash management
and reviewing prior years financial statements (including letters from the auditors and internal audit documents).
My suggestion would be to have this book ready for the controller on Day 1 when they start.

I also attended several of the CFMA virtual trainings for some construction specific knowledge, including topics
around the creation of the job schedule as well as "Best Practices for Monthly Job Reviews in Construction".
These classes proved helpful again in reinforcing that we already have the right things set up, but also provided
some little tweaks that I could make to either help streamline or better explain some of the steps in the process
and the "Why's" that can go unexplained.

Hope this helps!

Hi Mark - I am not sure if I responded to you yet.  I teach a construction business acumen course.  It is
approximately 3 hours and I can teach one on one to your new hire.  If you want to sit in, that is helpful from an
internal process and knowledge sharing - it takes the concepts that i am teaching and allows you to add "color
and clarity" specific to your Company.

Check out my website for my background and other offerings and let me know if you would like to discuss further.

Take care - Brigid

Depends on what type of real estate operations you are running?  Are you in property management, leasing or
construction?  It looks like you've outgrown Quickbooks and are looking for software that produces rent rolls,
reports specific to commercial real estate?  Yardi is good.  The other one I've used recently was MRI - very good
support and can handle office, retail, residential, industrial real estate.

Good afternoon,

We are in the market for a new real estate software. Currently we are using Quick books.

Had a few calls/demos w/Door Loop and liked it a lot. The only MAJOR drawback is that you cannot close a
month/year.

Been trying to connect w/Yardi sales but have not been successful as of yet. Does anyone in the community use
Door loop ? Can anyone recommend RE software that works for them?

Appreciate your input.

Thanks,

Kathryn,  we integrated HH2 for AP at the beginning of 2024.  When working, it's great.  Our problem has been behind the scenes, IT issues.   Frequently we have
communication issues between HH2 and Sage.  We would frequently have to reboot our systems to link the systems again.  I don't know whether it's an HH2 issue,
Sage issue or our server issue.

John,

 I'd like to second your suggestion. A structured approach to benchmarking department size, especially for accounting and IT/data roles, would be incredibly valuable.
It's getting harder to know what the "right size" looks like when you're trying to stay competitive and AI-ready, but also remain efficient.

In accounting, automation continues to evolve, but the amount of integration and data work involved often calls for support beyond traditional staff. We're finding similar
questions on the IT and data side: How much internal expertise do we need to support system integration, automation, and AI tools without overbuilding?

A related example we're also struggling with is contract review. Historically, that's sat with our COO or Construction Manager, but contracts are getting more complex-
and AI tools can help. Still, that raises a different question: if AI is doing the heavy lifting, who is responsible for overseeing and validating its responses? It's not just a
technology question-it's an organizational one.

Appreciate you surfacing this. I'd love to see CFMA explore these evolving roles in a more formal benchmarking effort.

Julie,

This is an excellent question - (for which I don't have an answer), and I'm hoping this response will keep the discussion current.

We should consider creating a simple survey through the CFMA Benchmarker committee to help companies determine the competitive strategies for 'right-sizing' their
several departments, e.g. accounting, legal, HR, IT, etc. We could determine number of employees as well as fixed budget for each dept.

Maintaining the right size of each of these departments gives us an idea of how we are maintaining competitiveness in our overhead, and at the same time spending in
order to grow!

Lets hope this thread stays active for a good while.

Hey Julie,

There are a few factors specific to your company that will determine how you setup your department.  One is your ERP system and any third party programs that link to
it.  This speaks to how automated (or not) your company is and how dependent you are on manual processes.  Another is the volume of vendor invoices and customer
billings you deal with and how automated these processes are.  These are just a couple of examples of the factors that affect how you set things up.

What does your current setup look like?

Talk to Claire Wilson at Siteline.  Siteline has been amazing for our business for AIA billings and waivers.  I have a significantly higher volume, but you should look at
the product.  All done fast and electronic.  All of the billing forms get loaded into Siteline and you can rinse/repeat each month, populating all of the them.  Construction
paperwork is annoying, but they make it simple.  Lien waivers are easy to get signed, handled, & tracked.

We would like to go paperless for our AIA/waiver signing, but the options we have looked at for e-notary services seem very costly to us (Pactima, Notarize, Docusign,
among others).  We have around 70 to 80 pay apps + waivers each month.  Has anyone else gone paperless in this process, and if so, how costly has it been and who
would you recommend, or even what other avenues would you recommend?

Are you really required to provide a notary?   With electronic signatures it is really an outdated process.   We stopped having a notary sign all non governmental

We previously attempted to integrate CMiC and Concur. Our company averages 1,150 charges a month over ~50 credit cards. The obstacle that we could not
overcome was moving individual receipts/.pdf files from Concur to CMiC. Concur bundles all the receipt images in one single file upon mass export. We must have one
image file export per transaction for importing into CMiC. Some receipts have multiple pages. We need this to allow the billing teams to automatically add the receipts
as back up to the CMiC biling invoices.

Has anyone successfully integrated CMiC and Concur that includes one image file per transactions? If so, which service provider(s) did you use?

Hi Julie-

I was CFO for a $300M GC in a previous life. I had a Controller, 4 Accounting Specialist, Payroll Specialist, Document Specialist, and Contract Manager. 3 of the AS
did mostly AP (we subcontracted out most work). The other AS did multiple things: handled payment/filing of payroll taxes, handled multi-state compliance, and JV
accounting. She could do AP too. One of the AS was PR backup for the PRS. The DS made sure any hard copies related to Accounting got put into our document
management system. It had a workflow that sent the doc to the responsible person to approve then it was routed to an inbox that all the AS could see so whoever had
time could grab it and process it. The CM was the only person who could interface things coming from Job Billing and Project Management into the Accounting
modules (Viewpoint Vista).

several departments, e.g. accounting, legal, HR, IT, etc. We could determine number of employees as well as fixed budget for each dept.

Maintaining the right size of each of these departments gives us an idea of how we are maintaining competitiveness in our overhead, and at the same time spending in
order to grow!

Lets hope this thread stays active for a good while.

Hi all,

Does anyone have an accounting department structure that they would share for a General Contractor that is anywhere between $400M-$750M?

Thanks

Julie

Going with the apartment is a smart choice compared to a hotel in this case.  For incidentals, they should be covered in the per diem rate for the area they are staying
in, so assuming that $68 is the areas going rate, then those items you mentioned should be covered.  That said, as this is your first big travel trip, I probably wouldn't
say no if the guys need to go above and beyond that per diem for necessities (like paper products as you mentioned) since this is such a long out of town job.  Travel
can be tough, you don't want to turn off your guys by not allowing them detergent to clean their clothes.  Our company is fine tuning our policy right now, but we would
likely follow this notion.

Hello!

   Reply to Group Online     View Thread     Recommend     Forward

We currently have an out-of-town project with an expected duration of eight months. I have arranged for a fully furnished apartment to be leased for the crew. They
receive a daily per diem rate of $63 for meals and $5 for incidentals on non-travel days. My question is, should I allow household items, such as paper goods,
detergent, and cleaning supplies, to be charged and paid for by the company? We rarely work out of town, and I am trying to mitigate costs and establish a system for
future projects that require travel. What are your policies?

What are your travel pay policies for hourly employees, do you pay their wages for the trip home?

I appreciate your help!

We have been using Finvari for two years and it works great.  Their customer service is amazing.  It is simplistic and easy to use and integrates very well with Vista.
This has saved us a lot of time on our AP side and allows us to focus on other items.  The review feature is also great.

Hey Peers,

I just saw an email from the AGC advertising Speedchain as a member discount program. So, I got looking and it appears they are offering a product similar to Finvari,
who are just about to implement. Can anyone compare or contrast the two products for us?

Thank you!
