 Custom software development to implement a system including integrating other software the client already uses starts at $15K and averages $50K

Service Differentiation

What makes you different from your competitors? What is your “special sauce”?
 Unlike other off the shelf software options, we offer a hybrid best of both worlds approach. We start with our Gearbox Construction Kit which includes a large amount of common functions including project management, Invoice and PO approval workflows. We then fully customize it to meet the clients specific needs.
 (ex: We implement 8 proprietary flows to maximally engage customers via email. 14 touch-points across a 30 day visit to our customers site has been proven to concert the highest % of site visits to paying and repeat customers)

Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? What do you do to improve their business?
 Our company has grown and is struggling to manage all the data required. We waste a lot of time with redundant data entry. Our executives don’t have an easy to access overview of the work in progress. Our data is spread out across multiple software systems that don’t talk to each other. We are stuck in the past and still use Excel too much.
 Gearbox will streamline the data systems that clients use to manage their business and allow them be more profitable, competitive and scalable.
 (ex: My clothing line has stopped reaching new buyers and we want to break into a new niche. Facebook keeps getting more expensive and makes it hard to target new buyers.
 Solution: Organic UGC content is the perfect mechanism to branch out to new customers. We help you find influencers who are exactly like your target audience, work with them to create videos and then use those videos to penetrate your new niche audience.)

Case Studies and Previous Customer Successes

For each service, what are case studies or recent customer successes that you use to highlight your expertise in your field?
 Created a system that allowed our client to manage subcontractors and invitations to bid in one simple system,  and double the amount of vendor bids they receive and manage. This gave them a competitive advantage and lower costs.
 For a client that provides services to the construction industry, we created a system that:- decreased the amount of time required to process work orders by 50%- decreased errors by 20%
 - integrated all their processes into one systemhttps://gearboxgo.com/ ( see testimonial video )
