# Gearbox & Blue Feather Merger

![](/_ipx/_/https:/s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/assets.gearboxgo.com/mergerdrawn.jpg)

We are excited to announce the merger between Gearbox Solutions and Blue Feather. It is scheduled to take place officially on September 1, 2022. On that date, our combined consultancy will continue conducting business as Gearbox Solutions.

Gearbox Solutions started serving clients in 2000. The growth over the past 22 years can directly be attributed to the tremendous client partnerships that have formed in that time. You have continued to place your trust in our team to solve unique business challenges through the development of custom software solutions. We have been lucky to grow as a firm and hire and retain top consultants and development talent. With the increased demand for custom solutions, integrations, and workflow improvements, we recognize the benefits of scaling with the right organization. We have decided to seek a merger with an organization of a similar size to offer more resource availability, a wider array of services, and depth of knowledge.

Blue Feather Group shares the same values we do. We believe in providing excellent service to our clients, timely communication, providing guidance around organizational workflow needs, and proactively addressing potential issues before they occur. Our main objective will continue to be your trusted partner for designing and building custom software, solving your most critical business challenges, and helping to make your organization more productive and successful overall. Blue Feather Group has been in business since 2013 serving clients in the USA and abroad. They have expertise working in a variety of industries and bring with them a team that specializes in developing modern web, desktop, and mobile solutions.

We are thankful for your continued partnership and support and look forward to what the next decade brings!
