American Book Company has been providing high quality, innovative educational resources based on national or state content standards for over 20 years. Its accurate, effective, easy-to-read, and engaging K-12 content promotes and ensures success for every student. With print and digital workbooks, ABC has been able to assist in student comprehension in preparation for state standardized testing.

## The Challenge

ABC approached Gearbox with a big, but simple problem - they needed online testing. That’s it. ABC wanted to break into the online testing space that had become so necessary for the education industry between 2020-2021.

## The Solution

It all started with detailed interviews about ABC’s needs, goals, and expectations, as well as how Gearbox could help ABC get to where it wanted to be. These extensive discussions and collaboration led to the creation of CourseWave - a large scale, SaaS platform with the ability to support hundreds of thousands of concurrent users. Launched in early 2022, CourseWave allows for ABC to create teaching and testing content to be available in all 50 states for grade levels K through 12 - while also taking into account the challenges faced when providing online resources for younger students (how many third graders can remember their passwords?).

CourseWave allows for eBooks to be uploaded directly to a resource - creating an all-in-one learning experience for students - and supports a wide variety of question types and allows for highly customizable content. A main highlight of the content creation side of the platform - the equation editor! Gearbox created a highly detailed equation editor for use in Math and Science content which will allow test creators and students to input complex equations and scientific notation. From fractions and superscript to square roots and polynomials - the equation editor can handle it.

Since the platform is entirely custom and extremely flexible, updates can be made and new features implemented well into the future - making CourseWave a long-term, adaptable addition to the ABC arsenal. At launch, CourseWave already had 30,000 questions input into the testing portion of the platform - and there is much to come.

## The Results

Through collaboration with Gearbox ABC has created a custom educational tool with the ability to automatically scale to any capacity and support hundreds of thousands of concurrent users. Detailed content creation systems ensure that ABC will always stay up-to-date with State standards and provide users with a premiere educational experience. And the highly adaptable nature of the platform will ensure that CourseWave will be able to remain at the forefront of the digital classroom space well into the future.
