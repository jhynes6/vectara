# The Benefits Of Using REST Instead Of SMTP In Your App

Email can be hard. Keep it simple by using standards and services specifically designed to easily send email from [Claris FileMaker](https://www.claris.com/filemaker/) or anywhere else.

We've been sending email for a long time. You may be surprised to know that the first email was sent in 1971.

This isn't a history lesson on email, but I do want to point out that REST APIs have been around and used since 2006, but we see many companies still using SMTP to send email and within the Claris FileMaker world, an email from that system may just consist of a script to open your email client of choice and populate the recipient, a subject, and maybe an attachment.

When SMTP works, it's great, but when it doesn't, the hurdles of troubleshooting can be daunting. In this video, we'll walk you alternatives with some example code and share some great services that allow you to **send email without the headache**.
