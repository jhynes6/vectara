# AWS S3 + FileMaker Integration

### **We expect...**

Attaching files, sharing documents, uploading images... it all sounds pretty straight forward.

### **The reality...**

It's often difficult to accomplish from a development perspective, and even harder to make easy for users.

We've been sharing some successful integrations we've recently done for some of our clients. In this video, I'll talk about Amazon Web Services S3 (Simple Storage Service), their platform for storing documents in the cloud. I'll share how easy it is and how seamless it can be across multiple platforms.

We'll run through a demo and we'll get to see communicating with S3 from Claris FileMaker, PHP, and JavaScript.

As always, if you have any questions or are interested in discussing integration, please give us a call or send us an email.
