# Introducing Mail Log for Laravel

Today, I'm excited to announce the release of Mail Log for Laravel, a simple yet powerful package that logs and displays all emails sent from your Laravel application.

## Why track your application emails?

Debugging email issues in Laravel applications can be challenging. Did the email actually send? What content was included? Was the formatting correct? Mail Log solves these problems by providing:

*   A clean, intuitive interface to view all sent emails
*   Complete email content preservation, including HTML and plain text versions
*   Easy filtering and searching capabilities
*   Commands for managing your email logs

## Simple interface, minimal setup

Mail Log comes with a simple management interface built with Inertia.js, Vue, PrimeVue, and TailwindCSS. Once installed, simply navigate to `/mail-log` in your application to see all emails your app has sent.

The interface provides both a list view of all emails and a detailed view of individual messages, making it easy to review and troubleshoot your application's communication.

## Try it today

Mail Log for Laravel is available now on Packagist. Get started with comprehensive email logging for your Laravel applications.
