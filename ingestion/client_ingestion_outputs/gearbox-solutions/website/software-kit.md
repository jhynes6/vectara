# Construction Software That Fits Your Workflow

## Your Business Isn't Off-the-Shelf.  
Your Software Shouldn't Be Either.

Stop forcing your team to use software that doesn't work for them. The Gearbox Construction Kit gives you the power of a fully custom platform, delivered in a fraction of the time and cost.

## The Challenge

You know the challenges. Generic software forces you to change your proven workflows, creating inefficiency and frustration. A fully custom solution sounds great, but it can take years and a massive budget to build from the ground up.

What if there was a better way?

## The Solution

The Gearbox Construction Kit is the solution. We start with a powerful, pre-built foundation that already includes the core features engineering and construction firms need. Then, we work with you to tailor, configure, and customize the platform to match your unique business processes.

You get the exact software you need, faster and more affordably.

### Save Time & Money

### Increase Adoption

## Supercharge Your Productivity with Integrated AI

Burdensome data entry and manual processing are a drain on your resources. Our construction kit uses powerful AI services to automate time-consuming tasks, reduce errors, and provide deeper insights.

### AI-Powered Invoice Entry

Simply drag-and-drop vendor invoices into the system. Our AI parses the full invoice, including header info, line items, and quantities, and enters it automatically. Save countless hours, eliminate manual data entry errors, and get a real-time view of project costs.

### Intelligent PO & Invoice Matching

Our AI goes a step further, automatically matching invoice line items to their corresponding purchase orders. Even if the descriptions don't match, the AI understands the context to link them correctly.

### Chat With Your Documents

Need to find relevant information in a 200 page document? Or verify a spec in a dense project plan? Just ask. Upload your documents and our "Document Chat" feature lets you ask questions in plain English. The AI finds the precise information and gives you the answer in seconds.
