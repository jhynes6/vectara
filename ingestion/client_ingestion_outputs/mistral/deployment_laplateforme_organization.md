# Workspaces

A La Plateforme workspace is a collective of accounts, each with a designated set of rights and permissions. Creating a workspace for your team enables you to:

*   Manage access and costs
*   Share fine-tuneds models among team members

tip

When you generate an API key from your organization's workspace and use it to create a fine-tuned model, your team members will be able to use this model. This ensures that the model is accessible and usable by all authorized team members.

## Create a workspace[​](#create-a-workspace "Direct link to Create a workspace")

When you first join La Plateforme, you can either create or join a workspace. Click on "Create workspace" to create and set up your workspace.
