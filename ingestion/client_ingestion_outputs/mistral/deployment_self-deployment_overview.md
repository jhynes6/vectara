# Self-deployment

Mistral AI models can be self-deployed on your own infrastructure through various inference engines. We recommend using [vLLM](https://vllm.readthedocs.io/), a highly-optimized Python-only serving framework which can expose an OpenAI-compatible API.

Other inference engine alternatives include [TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM) and [TGI](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/index).

You can also leverage specific tools to facilitate infrastructure management, such as [SkyPilot](https://skypilot.readthedocs.io) or [Cerebrium](https://www.cerebrium.ai).
