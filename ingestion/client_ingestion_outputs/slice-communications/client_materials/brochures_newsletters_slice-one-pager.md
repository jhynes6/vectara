The Importance of Strategic
Public Affairs and Community
Engagement

Public opinion and community opposition are playing
a more significant role than ever before in real estate
development. A “NIMBY” (“Not in My Back Yard”)
opposition group can derail and project regardless of
its legal merits.

To effectively navigate these challenges, law firms
need to equip their lawyers and paralegals with a
clearer understanding of how to apply strategic public
affairs and community engagement tactics. A lunch-
and-learn session with Kelly Henry, Principal with
H&G Public Affairs, a Slice Communications company,
provides your team with invaluable insights essential
for preventing delays, mitigating opposition, and
ensuring a smoother path to completion for
your clients.
