# Capitalize on Conferences

How to Make the Most of WBENC Events

WBENC provides its members two national networking and business development opportunities annually: Summit & Salute and National Conference & Business Fair. Each provides opportunities for Matchmaker meetings, networking, and informal gatherings. However, very little business gets done during the events themselves. Most corporate professionals are completely overwhelmed by the number of WBEs they meet. For that reason, business owners must have a strategic communications plan that incorporates a variety of tactics before, during, and after each event.

This eBook provides insight for WBEs into the mindset of supplier diversity professionals and corporate buyers. It provides practical advice and tactics to make the most of each WBENC event. And it outlines recommendations for staying top-of-mind with buyers over the course of the year between events.
