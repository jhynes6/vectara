# International Women’s Day with Valeria Maltoni, Conversation Agent

![](https://slicecommunications.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Valeria-Maltoni-1024x1024.png)

As a woman-owned business, we are honored to share the stories and messages of incredible woman leaders across a variety of industries for our International Women’s Day blog series.

This interview is with [Valeria Maltoni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/conversationagent/), Narrative Strategist and Founder at Conversation Agent.

**Why do you think it’s important to celebrate International Women’s Day?**

Celebration helps us recognize the progress we make and take stock of our achievements. It’s an important part of reflection and thoughtfulness.

**What motivates you to be a leader in your industry?**

The mission of my work is to reframe how we value things (and people) to transform business and society. I pursue it through narrative analysis and story design using conversation as a sense-making tool. Doing the work is my source of motivation.

**Are there any female leaders that have inspired you throughout your career?**

Journalist Oriana Fallaci and scientists Maria Montessori and Rita Levi-Montalcini are among the leaders and innovators I admire.

**What advice or message would you share with young women who are looking to build their careers?**

Be willing to do the work, and that includes building relationships with others. Competence only takes us so far, and learning to collaborate with and support others is critical to career success. The world is discovering what was always true: the power of social bonds and connections.
