# Why You Need a Social Media Plan

It is no question that social media holds a major influence over audiences of all kinds. Since over 65% of all American adults use at least one form of social media, it is no longer enough to simply have an online presence, but to have a presence that represents your company accurately and drives engagement.

**Why?**  
Customers are heavily influenced by the things they see while scrolling through their newsfeeds. Having a clear, attractive, and likeable page will not only drive new customers to your company, but also make them more likely to purchase something as well.

Along with this, it is easy to compare competing companies side-by-side when online. Therefore, the content you put out needs to look good, but also tell your viewers what your company does and what it stands for.

**How?**  
Creating a posting plan and social media strategy helps maximize your number of potential customers and increases the amount of engagement your viewers have with your content. A posting plan simply plans out what the content of your posts will be, and the date and time of your posts. Most posting plans are one to two weeks long.

**How a posting plan helps:**

- **Prevent Errors.**  
Simple things like misspelling a word or getting a date wrong can be a major turnoff for potential customers and make your company look unprofessional. Writing copy for posts on the go makes errors like these much more likely. Planning all of your posts for the week ahead will give you time to look everything over and ensure there are no mistakes.

- **Keep It Consistent.**  
Users respond positively when a page posts often and at a consistent rate. They typically don’t want to see the same page post 10 times in one day, and also won’t feel like it is worth following if they post only once a month. Planning out your posts allows you to be sure you’re posting at a rate that makes sense.

- **Target Your Audience.**  
Using a posting plan usually involves a social media management tool. These allow you to analyze the type of audience that is interacting with your posts the most. From here, you can better target your content for the audience that is responding to your posts. Along with this, it gives you ample time to plan out hashtags, polls, images, etc. that you know your audience will enjoy.

- **Have Quality Content.**  
Planning out your posts allows you to be sure that what you are putting out to potential customers is good quality. If you are in a rush to push content, you risk posting something that isn’t consistent with your brand and repeating old articles or images. Using a plan will allow you to have the time you need to research and find relevant blogs, graphics, etc. and to see all of your past posts to ensure all of your current posts are new and of high quality.

- **See What Doesn’t Work.**  
If you see a drop in engagement, you can compare the time with your posts to see what your audience was not responding to. Vice versa, you can look back to see what different strategies you used in the past that was driving engagement. This helps you alter your strategy to make sure all of your content is receptive to your audience.
