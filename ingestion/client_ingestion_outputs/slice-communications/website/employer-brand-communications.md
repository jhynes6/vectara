# Employer Branding Communications

Many companies today find their most pressing challenge is recruiting and retaining the right people. It can be the biggest barrier to growth – bigger than acquiring customers or clients.

Most marketing and communications have historically been focused on supporting revenue generation via sales and customer loyalty. Internal recruitment teams in human resources have played a crucial role in both hiring and retaining employees. But today, what employees want from their employer and how they consider a job opportunity is changing. They want companies that align with their values, and they validate a company’s authenticity by doing research online.

For that reason, smart companies invest in creating brands for who they are as employers. The best already have strong, well-defined cultures. They just need help articulating and communicating that culture so they get the right kind of attention.

## Approach

Slice has developed a detailed and thorough approach to defining and promoting employer brands. We begin with a set of surveys, audits, and worksheets. These help us understand the perception of the culture internally and externally. They also provide insight into the company’s strengths and priorities.

From there, we bring marketing, communications, and HR and recruiting together in our First Cut Session. We spend our time asking questions based on our research in order to identify areas of alignment and disagreement. In most cases, companies have never done any employer branding exercises, meaning HR and marketing have never worked together in this way before.
