# Attention Marketing

Since 2008, Slice Communications has been in the business of getting attention. Some call it marketing. Others call it advertising, public relations, social media, or branding. But no matter what you call it, the key is having the expertise to know which creative tools are best to get the job done and when to use them. That’s why we’ve developed our own original model for the types of attention organizations need to get.

## The Five Types of Attention in Marketing

In today’s crowded media landscape, attention is currency! With so much competition to make us look and listen, it can be hard to know how to stand out. That’s where our proven Attention Model comes in:

Through our work, Slice has identified five types of attention businesses strive for. By understanding the key differences and focusing on the right creative solutions to engage your Best People, we cut through the noise and get results with a focused and strategic approach.

### Aware Attention

Awareness is the first and most important step – without it, nothing else happens. It is focused on generating top-level impressions and putting your organization’s key messages in front of the broadest targeted audience.

### Connected Attention

After awareness comes connected attention. These people are interested in what you are saying and want to know more, but are not ready for a full conversation. They often are interested in value-add content and materials.

### Engaged Attention

Engaged attention is all around starting a conversation. For B2B companies, this can include people who have downloaded several pieces of content or filled out a contact form, while for B2C companies, it may mean someone who asks questions about a product.

### Converted Attention

Once someone is engaged, the goal is to eventually generate a conversion. More often than not, that would be selling a product, getting a donation for a nonprofit, or signing a new client contract for a service provider.

### Advocate Attention

After the sale, most companies think they’re done. However, there’s more to do — advocacy is the highest level of attention because it feeds the rest. It happens when those who have converted become invested in your success and support your work.
