## **Hiring a Finance Leader for Slice Communications**

## **Agency Culture Overview**

Slice Communications exists to get, keep, and use attention as the real currency driving our economy and our clients’ goals. We deliver trusted communication – with each other, with our clients, with our clients’ audiences, and to move our clients forward. When crisis strikes or things go sideways, we jump in, take the call, and work together toward resolution. We invest in people, focusing on deeper relationships and helping each other do our best work and grow.

The Slice company culture is primarily defined by our core values: Yes, And Energy, Copilot Attitude, Goal-Oriented Focus, and Always Learning. It is secondarily defined by EOS, the Entrepreneurial Operating System, which guides most of the processes by which we work.

Slice values the talents and abilities of its employees and seeks to foster an open, cooperative, and dynamic environment in which employees and the Company alike can thrive. Slice team members are accountable for their workload, ask for help from colleagues, and take breaks when they need them. We believe that work and life can exist in harmony, and we believe in the importance of caring for the mental health and well-being of our team. No one here is micromanaged and no one is on their own. We work really well together and support each other at every level of the company.

The Slice Squad operates in a hybrid work environment that our team loves because it enables them to work in whatever works best for them. Whether you choose to work from home or in one of our two co-working spaces located in Center City Philadelphia and Wilmington, Delaware, we maintain our ability to collaborate, achieve goals, and grow professionally. Beyond our work, we like to have fun, including two required in-person events each year, happy hours, family outings, and even small surprises in the mail!
