# Sky Management

## Challenge

Slice Communications was engaged by Sky Management to create awareness and secure media placements surrounding their recent Connecticut real estate acquisitions, a territory that Sky had never worked in the past. As Sky is a company with offices in Philadelphia and New York, Slice was tasked with establishing their roots in Connecticut and putting them on the forefront of media attention surrounding Real Estate and Sustainability.

## Insight

Slice tackled this challenge by reaching out to regional, local, national and trade press (both print and online) and strategically leveraging existing relationships while forging new ones in the Connecticut and greater New England area. Slice crafted press releases that were transactional in nature but also showed Skyâ€™s voice, positioning CEO and Founder Alex Dembitzer as the spokesperson for the company.

By focusing on thought leadership as well as transactional pieces, Slice was able to provide a clear picture of who Sky Management is and help to establish their place in the Connecticut landscape. Tapping into real estate trade publications as well as solar energy and renewable energy (due to the sustainable energy components at the acquisitions sites), Slice successfully positioned Sky in their target market.

## Success

The outcome was over 25 media placements in national, regional, local and trade publications including CityBizList, Mid Atlantic Real Estate Journal, New England Real Estate Journal, Solar Builder, and Manchester Journal Inquirer. Overall, these placements were both online and print and covered real estate, business, renewable energy as well as local news and happenings.
