## Public Relations

Getting your organization’s stories told by the right media outlet with the right audience can help get the eyes and ears of qualified potential customers and influencers. With decades of experience, our team’s approach goes beyond traditional media relations to generate attention for clients.

## Social Media

Social media marketing is all about connecting and engaging with real people in real time on the right platforms. Our team of experts help clients develop a digital voice, share key messaging to the right audience, and track performance to measure success and pull key insights and learnings.

## Email Marketing

Email remains one of the most effective messaging channels and when done right, can create a unique and personalized experience for subscribers. Slice’s experts support all email marketing efforts from list management and segmentation, tool set-up, automations, and strategic content creation.

## Strategy

Effective marketing strategies exist to support the growth of your business. Slice’s strategy team helps meet audiences where they are with the right content and messaging to garner their attention. From our First Cut Session, we create a strategic roadmap filled with tailored approaches to meet your goals.

## Content

Creating original content that is relevant, insightful, and actionable is key to building awareness and trust with your audience. Slice’s experts can create content from blogs and articles to eBooks to showcase your thought leadership. Adding them to the editorial calendar ensures they are being shared consistently and aptly.

## Measurement

We’ve all heard it before: you can’t manage what you can’t measure. That is why our team makes sure we are able to collect accurate data to then set meaningful goals against. Our weekly scorecard keeps us accountable to clients and our value reports use 13 weeks of data to pull key insights.

## Crisis Planning and Response

Great companies are the ones that identify and plan for issues. Slice can prepare plans, handbooks, and materials for a crisis, and then host workshops to prepare teams to react. If and when necessary, the Slice team can offer real-time crisis response.

## Training

We exist to support spokespeople and thought leaders to best represent their organizations externally through the media and social media. Having trained everyone from Fortune 500 executives to 5th graders, we offer various training workshops on how to best communicate the most important messages.

## Employer Brand Communications

We often work with companies who overlook a critical audience — their employees. It’s important, now more than ever, to invest in your company brand. Slice’s EBC approach helps align values, showcase your work culture, and garner attention from new employees.
