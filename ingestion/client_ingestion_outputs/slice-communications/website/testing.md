# Our Services

![Strategy](https://slicecommunications.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Slice-Icons_Services-Strategy-Icon-150x150.png)

[**Strategy**](https://slicecommunications.com/marketing-communications-strategy) – Our [First Cut Session](/firstcutsession/) was designed to help us get to know our fast-growing clients quickly and apply our model specifically to achieve their goals. The output is a communications strategy that forms the basis of our work together and is often evolved as we learn and grow.

![Content](https://slicecommunications.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Slice-Icons_Services-Content-Development-Icon-150x150.png)

[**Content**](https://slicecommunications.com/content-development) – From the beginning, we held the point-of-view that great communication is based in relevant, insightful and actionable content. We help companies speak so that others listen and take actions to create growth. [Bylined articles](/bylined-articles/), [blogs](/blog-writing/), and [interactive video content](https://slicecommunications.com/case-study/lankenau-medical-center) are all in our wheelhouse.

![Public Relations](https://slicecommunications.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Slice-Icons_Services-Public-Relations-Icon-150x150.png)

[**Public Relations**](https://slicecommunications.com/public-relations) – Media outreach is one of the ways we distribute content to help our clients get the ears and eyes of potential customers and influencers. Our approach is to listen first and pitch second. See what we did during the winter Olympics for [Godshall’s Quality Meats](https://slicecommunications.com/case-study/godshalls-quality-meats). Want to know more about how we can help your company with public relations? Read about how we approach [press releases](/press-releases/), [press kits](/press-kit/), [media outreach](/media-outreach/), and [media training](/media-training/).

![Social Media](https://slicecommunications.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Slice-Icons_Services-Social-Media-Icon-150x150.png)

[**Social Media**](https://slicecommunications.com/social-media) – Social media is another way we get content directly to customers and influencers. We interact with them, listen to them, and track their interactions to measure success and learn. We can help your business make the most of [Facebook](/5-common-facebook-questions/), [Twitter](/getting-a-handle-on-twitter/), [LinkedIn](/linkedin/), [Pinterest](/pinterest-for-business-why-you-need-it-now/), [Instagram](/toinstagram/), or pretty much any other social network. Just [tweet us](https://twitter.com/slicecomm) for more information.

![Email Marketing](https://slicecommunications.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Slice-Icons_Services-Email-Marketing-Icon-150x150.png)

[**Email Marketing**](https://slicecommunications.com/email-marketing) – We firmly believe that good email should elicit a response. Slice can tackle email marketing efforts from email list collection and segmentation, email tool set-up, broadcasts and even automation. Our team of experts will develop the content and execute the strategy to be sure you are staying top of mind with your targeted audience.

![Measurement](https://slicecommunications.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Slice-Icons_Services-Reporting-Analytics-Icon-150x150.png)

[**Measurement**](https://slicecommunications.com/measurement) – We’ve all heard it before: you can’t manage what you can’t measure. While communications efforts have been historically difficult to track and report impact, we have developed some new approaches to prove the value of content, public relations, and social media. See how we use [link tagging](/lets-play-tag-measuring-marketing-roi-through-link-tagging/) to help our clients begin to show return on investment to their internal stakeholders.

![Crisis Planning and Response](https://slicecommunications.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Slice-Icons_Services-Crisis-Management-Icon-150x150.png)

[**Crisis Planning and Response**](https://slicecommunications.com/crisis-planning-and-response) – Great companies are the ones that identify and plan for issues. Slice can prepare plans, handbooks, and materials for a crisis, and then host workshops to prepare teams to react. If and when necessary, the Slice team can offer real-time crisis response.
