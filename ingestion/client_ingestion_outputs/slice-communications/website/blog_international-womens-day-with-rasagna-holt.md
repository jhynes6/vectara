# International Women’s Day feature with Rasagna Holt, KGTiger Corporation

As a women-owned business, we are honored to highlight women who are incredible leaders in marketing and communications across a wide variety of industries. Each year on International Women’s Day we share an interview series celebrating these women and sharing their stories.

This interview is with [Rasagna Holt](http://linkedin.com/in/rasagnap), CEO of KGTiger Corporation.

**How do you define your leadership?**

To be a leader is to perform at a level that inspires others to achieve the same goal. To understand individual strengths and weaknesses and build teams that can leverage these attributes. To build inclusive teams with people from diverse backgrounds.

**How has your leadership changed in the past year?**

I believe in a collaborative environment where everyone gets to speak freely and express their opinion. I have worked towards fostering this culture in my organization where people from all levels can freely express their opinion and bring their ideas to the table.

**Can you share a story that demonstrates a key learning for you in your leadership journey?**

Delegation doesn’t necessarily come easily for me. I have made a conscious effort to delegate over the last year and use my time on ROI-generating tasks.

#### **Check out the stories of other incredible women leaders in the marketing and communications industry.**
