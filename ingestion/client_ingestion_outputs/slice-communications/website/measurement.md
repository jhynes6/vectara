# Marketing Analytics & Campaign Measurement

The question we get the most frequently from companies is how to measure the success of a marketing campaign. We believe that measuring success is and always should be about learning and improving. Companies that keep getting better about delivering their messages to the right people are the ones that will see the most growth and biggest success.

Our approach to measurement in communications has four parts:

## **Set Good Marketing Goals**

Unfortunately, many businesses do not currently have their marketing goals aligned with their business goals. Marketing teams are more focused on the number of followers or speaking opportunities they have instead of creating content that will help grow the business. At Slice, we have a very specific and effective approach to setting meaningful goals that increase confidence in marketing. Our eBook, _[A CEO’s Guide to Confidence in Marketing](https://slicecommunications.com/publication/a-ceos-guide-to-confidence-in-marketing)_, outlines our method of setting goals and how to align your marketing efforts with your business’s goals.

## **Collect Good Data & Analytics**

Once sufficient goals are in place, we need to be able to collect accurate data to keep track of our goals. This often means investing in marketing infrastructure such as Google Analytics, a social media CMS, a CRM, Cision, or other tools that provide good, clean data. [Our team of experts](https://slicecommunications.com/team) helps put best practices, such as link tagging, in place to ensure efficient tracking and retrieval of all analytics. This is very important because if this is not done and done well, measurements will not be insightful or actionable.

## **Identify Key Insights**

Not all data is actionable because not all data will tell us what we need to know. Our team likes to focus on the most important 5-15 data points and set goals against them in the form of a scorecard. We look at trends over time, comparisons to competitors, and progress towards hitting goals to draw new learnings for our clients.

## **Make Data-Driven Changes**

Once we’ve measured and learned something new, we act on it. Our team constantly recommends new approaches, tactics, and campaigns based on what we’ve seen work effectively according to the data. Often we push our clients out of their comfort zones to [try new strategies](https://slicecommunications.com/marketing-communications-strategy) and set themselves apart from their competitors.
