# Classic Towns of Greater Philadelphia

## Challenge

Founded in 2004, the [Classic Towns of Greater Philadelphia](https://www.classictowns.org) program developed by the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission aimed to promote several towns and neighborhoods by highlighting the reasons they are great places to live, work, and play. Slice Communications worked with Classic Towns to increase awareness of the program through organic social media management, paid social advertising, and email marketing.

## Insight

During our First Cut and strategy process, we identified Classic Towns’ ideal target audiences within the Greater Philadelphia area. With this information, our team developed messaging that would resonate with these audiences and encourage them to engage.

Our social media efforts included regular postings on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram that highlighted over 20 different towns and the events they hosted. To further the relationship with these towns, we shared posts from their channels, attended their events, and provided live coverage on social media.

In addition, we implemented monthly email newsletters that contained a strategic mix of general town spotlights, events and news. Through this, we were able to leverage the newsletters as an information source for the Greater Philadelphia community.

## Success

Our social media efforts were able to increase the average number of impressions per month by 319%, going from an average of 8,900 impressions per month to over 37,300. Additionally, their average engagements per month increased by 369%, rising from an average of 431 engagements per month to over 2,000. Finally, we were able to increase their following by 14% in six months. For their email efforts, we maintained an average click through rate of 16%; all of the traffic was driven to the Classic Towns website or to the individual towns’ website.
