# Hunt Auctions

## Challenge

Slice Communications was hired by [Hunt Auctions, LLC](https://www.huntauctions.com) for two engagements in 2019 surrounding their vintage sports memorabilia auctions. The first auction was held on July 9th, 2019 in Cleveland Ohio as part of Major League Baseball’s 2019 All Star Game festivities, while the second auction was held on November 9th, 2019 at the Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory in Louisville Kentucky.

## Insight

We developed and executed public relations on-site media tour plans for Hunt Auctions for two of their baseball-related auctions held in July and November.  

In July 2019 we traveled to the Cleveland area at the end of June, a week ahead of MLB’s All-Star game to do a pre-event media tour focused on morning television shows and talk radio. We then returned to Cleveland for MLB’s All-Star Week for more PR efforts focusing primarily on getting coverage of this year’s auction, highlighted by Hall of Famer Ivan “Pudge” Rodriguez’s personal collection, down at MLB’s Play Ball Park which included multiple television spots, radio spots, and print articles.

In November, we performed a media tour of the Cincinnati Ohio and Louisville Kentucky media markets prior to the annual Louisville Slugger Museum and Factory auction. This auction featured Bob Crotty’s Green Diamond Collection. For more than 50 years, Crotty collected a museum quality collection of baseball history that he displayed at his private museum/club in Montgomery, Ohio. This media tour included local morning news programs, talk radio, local newspapers, and the Associated Press.

## Success

For these two events, Slice Communications achieved a combined 33 media hits including 17 media broadcast segments (television and radio) for a total of 31.2 million impressions.
