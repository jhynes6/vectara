# Interview with Brittany Connor, Terrain Cafe + Terrain Events

During today’s uncertain times, marketing and communications pros are being forced to operate through previously uncharted waters. To learn more about navigating this situation, we’ve interviewed communications experts across industries.

This interview is with [Brittany Connor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bconnpsu/), the Promotions and Marketing Director for Terrain Cafe + Terrain Events, under URBN.

**What do you think has been your most effective communication?**

Our most important conversations have been happening behind the scenes with our events clients. I can’t think of a worse message to deliver than having to cancel or postpone someone’s wedding, which is something our team has had to do countless times over the past few weeks. Luckily, our team has been honest and nimble, working with couples and families to reschedule their occasions as much as possible through these tough phone calls.

**What do you think will be the biggest challenge for communicators in the coming weeks and months?**

The biggest hurdle for all communicators during this situation has been the incredible amount of uncertainty surrounding it. We’re all taking it day-by-day, but it’s difficult to feel prepared when things change on a dime. If nothing else, it’s teaching us how to live in the moment and message accordingly.

**What advice do you have for people in marketing communications for whom this is their first crisis situation?**

In this particular situation, I’ve found that it’s important to seek second, third and even fourth opinions on my communication. When you’re dealing with an unprecedented situation like this pandemic, there may not always be a “right way” to message, but there is more than likely a “wrong way.” Ask for help, run your verbiage by a few colleagues, and rework until it feels right.
