# Crisis Communications

Great companies are the ones that identify and plan for issues. That is why our crisis planning efforts begin with identifying the issues and collaboratively establishing a [crisis communications plan](https://slicecommunications.com/blog/how-to-create-a-crisis-communications-plan) that is clear and consistent.

## Crisis Workshop

The Slice team works with the client’s internal team to complete a [planning worksheet](https://slicecommunications.com/publication/crisis-communications-planning-worksheet) outlining situations that they may face and brainstorm issues unique to them. We then rate and prioritize, identifying high-impact occurrences. The result of this workshop is for the client to have an understanding of what issues they should respond to and in what ways.

## Crisis Playbook Development

Each of the top issues will receive its own plan, handbook, and materials. Underlying philosophies, approaches, and best practices will be included that can be applied to similar types of events. The materials may include standard operating procedures as well as draft landing pages, press statements, social media posts, talking points, email broadcasts, and location signage.

## Crisis Communication Training

Crisis plans are only as good as the people executing them. That’s why we host workshops for relevant staff to ensure they comprehend the plans and materials available to them. During these training sessions, clients will have the opportunity to ask questions and provide insights that could be incorporated into plan revisions. Together we design and execute table-top practice sessions to create meaningful working relationships between the parties and identify where breakdowns may happen. These practice sessions are invaluable to organizations that take preparation and risk management seriously.
