# Marissa Bruette

Vice President of Delivery  
[mbruette@slicecommunications.com](mailto:mbruette@slicecommunications.com)

Marissa is skilled in creating visually engaging content and crafting compelling stories to help clients reach their target audiences on a meaningful level. She began her career in the Digital Marketing space as a Social Media Account Manager where she learned to curate social strategies and execute organic and paid efforts. While she enjoyed client relations, she learned she had an act for turning mundane topics into exciting conversations, so she joined the strategy team as a Content Strategist.

Marissa’s current role as Vice President of Delivery allows her to lead her team in achieving client goals by crafting the right mix of [Goal-Oriented Content](https://slicecommunications.com/blog/creating-goal-oriented-content-that-drives-results) for a wide range of industries. She has completed work for manufacturers, nonprofits, retail, architects, community programs, festivals, food and beverage, radio and TV, and more.

Whether she’s drafting editorial calendars or managing an influencer program, she has a passion for all things content. Since joining the strategy team she has educated other professionals on how to begin their social media journey by speaking at events like Social Media Day Philadelphia and guest speaking at Temple University’s Fox.

Marissa graduated from Temple University with a bachelor’s degree in Communication Studies with a focus on Contemporary Media Environments. When not in the office, you can find her exploring a new city.
