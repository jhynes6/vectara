# The Importance of Revisiting Your Employee Social Media Policy

Written by: Cassandra Bailey

I’ve been thinking quite a bit lately about companies’ social media policies, especially as they have many of their employees (if not all), working remotely from home. That means they have more time to access social media channels like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn, TikTok, YouTube, _you name it._

We are seeing usage increase, which is not surprising. However, now may be a really good time for you to take a look at your company’s social media policy for employees to ensure that it is still relevant and up-to-date.  

You may want to adjust your social media policy to address any particular issues that your team might be facing right now in light of working from home or working remotely. You may also want to include a paragraph or an addendum that is specifically about the situation we are facing today. Explain what is OK to share online and what is not OK to share online in terms of company news and information.  

Review the policy, spend some time talking about it internally and then make sure that you roll out the revision effectively. That may mean sending an email to everyone with a link, but we encourage you to do something more than that.  

It may be beneficial to have a town hall conference call or video conference. You may also want to engage influencers in your company, including champions and managers, to make sure that it gets out to people. You may even want to create a little game around it, where people can complete a series of questions and get a prize in return. This is an opportunity to ensure that the information that is important is delivered and also find a way for employees to interact with your company and each other.  

So, take a minute and review your company’s social media policy. Make sure people know what’s in it and what it means for them.
