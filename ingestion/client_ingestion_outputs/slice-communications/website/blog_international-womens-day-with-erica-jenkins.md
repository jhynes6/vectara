# International Women’s Day with Erica Jenkins, Crayon

![](https://slicecommunications.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Erica-Jenkins-1024x1024.png)

As a woman-owned business, we are honored to share the stories and messages of incredible woman leaders across a variety of industries for our International Women’s Day blog series.

This interview is with [Erica Jenkins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erica-jenkins/), Chief Product Officer at Crayon.

**Why do you think it’s important to celebrate International Women’s Day?**

The key aspect that is most important to me is women’s rights to reproductive rights and choices about their own bodies. I learned several years ago about FGM – female genital mutilation – and I was appalled by it. Women are humans and deserve to make choices on their own but sadly there are places in the world, including the United States, that allow for this abuse.

**What motivates you to be a leader in your industry?**

As a woman in technology, it’s so important to mentor and support other females. As a C-level executive in technology, I’m tired of being the only woman in the room who has to work five times harder than my male counterparts. The more diversity, the more diverse viewpoints in decision-making.

**Are there any female leaders that have inspired you throughout your career?**

Kim Scott, the author of _Radical Candor_. Her management advice has molded my leadership style 100%.

**What advice or message would you share with young women who are looking to build their careers?**

Be curious. Those who strive to learn, read, analyze and start to formulate proposals for a solution are highly valued by great managers.
