# Dana Schmidt

Chief Operations Officer  
[dschmidt@slicecommunications.com](mailto:dschmidt@slicecommunications.com)

Dana Schmidt is the Chief Operations Officer at Slice Communications. Driven by her passion for digital marketing, Dana champions brand storytelling across social media, PR and email platforms.

Dana’s work has taken her from her hometown in Bucks County to New York City, to Denver, and back to Philadelphia–and even earned her an Emmy award along the way for her work on the “Women and Girls Lead” series at Rocky Mountain PBS. In addition to co-authoring [Pay Attention!](https://www.amazon.com/Pay-Attention-Keep-Grow-Business/dp/1637422644) and [Social Media is About People](https://www.amazon.com/Social-Media-People-Cassandra-Bailey-ebook/dp/B09ZWHB3PW), she has shared her expertise with marketing and communication professionals through outlets like [_Adweek_](https://www.adweek.com/performance-marketing/destinations-coast-coast-are-wooing-young-visitors-snapchat-172377/), [_NBC10_](https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/being-a-social-media-influencer_philadelphia/495/), [_6ABC’s Inside Story_](https://6abc.com/dangers-of-social-media-facebook-whistleblower-stephanie-humphrey-dana-schmidt/11099535/), and as a speaker at several national conferences. Prior to joining the Slice team, Dana worked in digital marketing at Philadelphia’s premier public broadcasting station, WHYY, as well as the city’s tourism agency, Visit Philly.

Having earned her Bachelor’s degree in Communications from New York University, Dana returned to NYU for her Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing. Although she’d like to start her novel in her free time, she is more likely out hiking with her husband, their wonderful children, and their fluffy husky.
