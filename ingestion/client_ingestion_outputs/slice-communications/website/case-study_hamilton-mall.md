# Hamilton Mall

## Challenge

Located in Mays Landing, New Jersey, [Hamilton Mall](https://shophamilton.com) is a shopping destination that aimed to position itself as a community center for the South Jersey community. Slice worked with Hamilton Mall for over two years to help them achieve this awareness through public relations tactics and event coordination.

## Insight

Slice developed and executed a public relations plan for Hamilton Mall that focused on generating greater awareness and media placements for its more than 50 yearly free community events. For these events, we not only helped promote the existing events, but also helped create new events, partnerships, and sponsorships.  

Two events we spearheaded were an Etsy Creator Market and a community Pet Adoption fair. The Etsy Creator Market was a pop-up market allowed local New Jersey Etsy creators to sell their goods and promote their online stores at the mall. This event reached its cap of 20 local vendors so quickly, that there was a waiting list for future creator markets. The adoption fair was the first of its kind in Southern New Jersey that featured five local animal rescue centers and shelters coming together to find homes for pets in need.

In addition to this events and public relations work, we supported the mall in several other ways. We provided crisis communications assistance by crafting responses for incidents at the mall and store closings. Additionally, we performed a bi-monthly competitive review of mall competitors for the Hamilton Mall to keep them informed of what the other malls were doing as well. Finally, we submitted Hamilton Mall’s Marketing Manager for professional awards. This resulted in her being named one of Atlantic County’s 40 under 40 and the Greater Atlantic City Chamber of Commerce’s Young Professional of the Year.

## Success

Through building relationships with local reports and news organizations, our various media alerts and press releases we were able to get the Hamilton Mall over 60 media placements in about two years in publications including AC Weekly, Press of AC, the Hamilton Current, SNJ Today, and Shore Local.
