# Social Media Marketing Training

Our team at Slice Communications works with spokespeople and thought leaders to help them best represent their organizations externally through the media and social media. We have trained everyone from Fortune 500 executives to 5th graders on how to best communicate their most important messages. We have developed the following custom marketing training workshops to share our professional experience and expertise with those who have been designated to speak on behalf of their companies, institutions, and nonprofit organizations.

### **Media Training**

A conversation with a reporter is unlike any other conversation a person will have. That’s because a spokesperson’s job is to deliver messages, not answer questions. In this [media training session](https://slicecommunications.com/media-training), we will provide background and best practices for a small group. We will then do one-on-one practice sessions to put theory to work in real-life scenarios. Being a media spokesperson is just like any other skill: it requires practice. For that reason, we recommend executives and thought leaders engage in media training twice a year. In this training session, we will cover:

* Background on the Media
* Types of Interviews
* Selecting Priority Messages to Communicate
* Blocking and Bridging
* Handling High Conflict Interviews

### **Social Media Policy Roll Out / Update**

A company’s social media policy is only as good as its compliance. People must know what is in it, why it is the way it is, how it supports the overall business goal, and how they can help. [Our team at Slice](https://slicecommunications.com/team) are experts at helping companies craft and communicate social media policies. We make sure the most important parts of the policy are clear, concise, and memorable. We make it fun for employees at all levels using humor, memes, exercises, and even a game for 90 days following the rollout. Our workshop includes:

* Policy Review
* Presentation Development
* Material / Handout / Worksheet Development
* Session Facilitation
* Followup Activities / Gamification 

### **LinkedIn for Thought Leaders**

Executives and thought leaders from any organization can use LinkedIn to powerfully promote themselves and their companies. It’s the primary platform for all business communications, including engaging investors, influencers, referral partners, employees, potential employees, customers, potential customers, and community leaders. However, most executives have no LinkedIn strategy at all. In this workshop, we will cover:

* Strategies for Executives
* Differentiating Yourself from Your Company
* Portraying Your Leadership Through Your Profile
* Best Practices for Promoting Yourself and Your Company
* How to Support Your Company’s LinkedIn Efforts
* Delegation – How and When to Do It

### **LinkedIn for Recruiting**

People like to work with people they like. However, using LinkedIn for recruiting is usually left to the HR department. This is a mistake. High quality candidates often research their potential bosses and colleagues on LinkedIn during the interview process. For this reason, leaders should have robust, active LinkedIn accounts. In this hands-on session, we will help leaders with:

* Profile Updates
    * Taglines / One Sentence Descriptions
    * Personal Statements
    * Images
    * Job History Descriptions
    * Awards / Affiliations / Boards / Etc.
* Inbox Management
* Posting and Updates Best Practices

### **LinkedIn for Sales**

Many professionals are on LinkedIn looking for people, products, and services. However, many sales people don’t know all the tools, technology, and tricks to most effectively stay connected with customers, top-of-mind with influencers, and interesting to prospects. Participants will learn how to:

* Update Their LinkedIn Profile to Best Represent the Company
* Post Regularly to Stay Top-of-Mind
    * What to Post
    * When to Post
    * How to Post
* Use Sales Navigator for New Opportunities
* Leverage LinkedIn Connections for Ongoing Marketing

### **Twitter for Executives**

We are often asked whether a CEO or executive should have a social media presence separate from the company. The answer is “yes”, as long as it is done strategically. We designed this workshop to be one-on-one with a CEO or a small group of executives. We also encourage marketing professionals to participate in order to create a consistent strategy. Discussions will include:

* Review of Overall Organization Social Media Strategy
* Goals for Executives
* Identification of Key Messages to be Communicated
* Identification of Other Opportunities for Inclusion
* Plan for Consistent and Engaging Posting

### **Twitter for Conferences and Events**

Many companies spend tens of hundreds or thousands of dollars each year attending conferences and events. However, they don’t get the best return on investment because they don’t have a social media plan to extend their real-life activities online. Twitter is the most effective “in real life” social media channel. Everyone representing a company at a conference or event should be well-trained on how to use it before, during, or after an event to connect with other attendees. This can pay off in terms of new opportunities with customers, employees, or referral partners. In this interactive workshop we cover:

* Updating Your Profile to Represent the Company
* Setting Goals 
* Planning for the Conference
    * Before
    * During
    * After
* Turning Connections into Opportunities
* Tweeting Between Events
