# Kelly Morrin

Senior Director of Client Success  
[kmorrin@slicecommunications.com](mailto:kmorrin@slicecommunications.com)

For the past decade, Kelly Morrin has worked in the marketing, sales, and communications world and has loved every minute of it. Whether she was involved with coordinating large benefit concerts for breast cancer awareness or building and managing brands for small businesses, she has always enjoyed digital marketing, user experience, brand management, and anything/everything in between. Over the last few years, Kelly has worked closely with client relationships in order to bridge the gap between strategy and success.

Kelly graduated from Temple University with a degree in Media Studies and Production, with a Concentration in Emergent Media, and during her time there traveled to London for a six-week course on Children’s Media in the UK. That study abroad program inspired her love for travel and nurtured her interest in human-centric marketing and strategic communication.

On top of traveling, she loves anything to do with the outdoors, yoga, reading thrillers, and spending time with her dog, Lucy.
