__“The work of Slice Communications is a huge part of our story. Beginning with listening to our mission and goals, Slice took the time to understand not just our business goals, but the “why” of what we do. They developed incredibly effective marketing strategies that didn’t just drive attention, but drove impact, reflecting both our business goals and who we were as an organization. In addition, Slice wasn’t just a communications partner, but a true partner, taking the time to engage in all aspects of our organization. Slice’s deep care, attention to detail, and ability to truly understand the “why” of what we do has had a profound and lasting impact on Hopeworks.__“
