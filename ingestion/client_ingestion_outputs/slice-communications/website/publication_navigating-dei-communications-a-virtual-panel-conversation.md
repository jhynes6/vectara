# Navigating DEI Communications: A Virtual Panel Conversation

The Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) communications landscape has undergone a significant transformation over the past year. Previously considered a standard component of corporate social responsibility, DEI communications have become a politically charged issue. Increasing government regulations, legal challenges, and public scrutiny have transformed DEI communications into a high-risk endeavor. Consequently, CMOs and corporate communications leaders must now approach all DEI communications with the same gravity as crisis communications.

Slice Communications hosted a panel discussion with experts in this field, who examined various approaches, best practices, and case studies to provide actionable insights applicable to your present and future work.

**Panelists include:**

* Allen Riddick, Executive Director, Supplier Inclusion and Procurement Services, Drexel University
* Clara Mattucci, Chief Relationships Officer, Slice Communications
* Alexander J. Nassar, Employment Law Practice Leader, Royer Cooper Cohen Braunfeld LLC
* Kyle Anderson, Senior Principal, Cozen Oâ€™Connor Public Strategies

* **After you watch the full webinar, let us know if you have any follow-up questions or specific communications challenges Slice can help you address!**
