# Retention Marketing Blog Series: Research Current Audience

Truly understanding your client’s and customer’s needs, interests and aspirations is essential to discerning the best way to engage and motivate them. That’s why research initiatives are so powerful as an investment. Quantitative research is about measurable data, while qualitative research relies on personal interviews or information that show how people think and respond to society and real-world issues. Captured in a discovery document, the combination of both is dynamic! It can uncover answers to important questions such as what concerns your customers most? What keeps them up at night? What do they think about your brand? What do they want from your products/services? Smart, thoughtful research can be the secret weapon that puts you ahead of your competition and forefront in the minds of your customers.

See the video below for more insights on the importance of understanding your audience and the impact that knowledge can have on your own business.
