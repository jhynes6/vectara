# Position for Selling

Selling your business can be complicated in many ways. One thing that doesn’t have to be complex is how you position and promote it to potential buyers.

Our team at Slice has worked with CEOs who are preparing to sell their businesses, either to strategic buyers or to private equity investors. Our work is aimed at getting you a high return.

## Approach

Buyers and investors want to know where a company is positioned in the market. They do not have the time or patience for a long drawn-out explanation. We work with our clients to create a messaging package that is clear, concise, and compelling for communication with all audiences. It includes:

* **Positioning Statement** – One sentence that clearly communications what makes your company different and special.
* **Point-of-View** – People buy or buy from companies that believe the same things they do. This simple statement communications what the owners believe and why they do what they do.
* **Supporting Messages** – There are typically 3-5 other things people need to know if they are going to be interested in working with your company. These must be clearly articulated and communicated again and again.

Once we have established your messaging trinity, we will update all of your marketing communications materials to be aligned with them: website, social media channels, sales materials, press releases, etc. This will show potential buyers that you know who you are and have your act together.
