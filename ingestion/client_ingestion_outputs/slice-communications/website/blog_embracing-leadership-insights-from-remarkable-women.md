# Embracing Leadership: Insights from Remarkable Women

For Slice’s yearly celebration of International Women’s Day, our [blog series](https://slicecommunications.com/blog/international-womens-day-2023) features inspiring words from women in leadership. This year, we reached out to our female trailblazers and requested a brief video describing what it means to be an empowering woman in leadership. It’s crucial to recognize and celebrate the accomplishments, wisdom, and resilience of women in various fields but a glimpse into how they got there is all the more enlightening. Our celebratory video draws inspiration from the insights shared by extraordinary women leaders and business owners. Their words offer invaluable lessons on leadership, empowerment, and the importance of supporting one another.

We found that the majority of the responses had one common theme: compassion—a trait shared by many women—is the most powerful leadership skill.

We are pleased to present the fierce women leaders featured in our annual International Women’s Day Celebration.

As we honor International Women’s Day, let’s heed the wisdom of these extraordinary women by embracing our uniqueness, making others feel valued, and cultivating creativity and diversity in our industries. We give ourselves grace and cultivate power while, as Penny Zenker suggests, we reset, we can create the space to build meaningful relationships, and empower one another to reach new heights both professionally and in our day-to-day lives. Together, we can create a brighter, more equitable future for all. Happy International Women’s Day!
