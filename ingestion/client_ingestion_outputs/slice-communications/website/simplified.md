# simplified. by Slice

[Slice Communications](https://slicecommunications.com/about) was founded to make people pay attention to our clients. We do that using PR, social media, and email marketing. However, some businesses don’t need everything – they just need straightforward digital marketing that helps them stay connected and top-of-mind. They also don’t want to hire a full-time marketing person. That is why we created **simplified. by Slice**.

**simplified. by Slice** is everything you need to stay connected and top-of-mind with your customers, prospects, and centers of influence. It includes:

* **Strategy** – We will develop a plan with goals and objectives to ensure we are delivering what you need.
* **Content** – Our team will research, write, and post one original blog per month to keep your website fresh and give people a reason to visit it.
* **Social Media** – We will manage your LinkedIn and Facebook pages, ensuring new posts go out multiple times per week.
* **Email Marketing** – Every month, we will write, design, and send an email newsletter that will put your information in your audiences’ inboxes.
* **Reporting** – We will provide monthly reports that show the progress we’re making towards your goals.
