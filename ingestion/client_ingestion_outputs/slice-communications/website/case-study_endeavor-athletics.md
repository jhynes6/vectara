# Endeavor Athletics

## Challenge

Founded by Philadelphia native and former NHL player Colby Cohen, [Endeavor Athletic’s](https://endeavorathletic.com/) mission is to create athletic apparel that enhances an athlete’s performance.

Endeavor established a pop-up shop in Philadelphia’s trendy Rittenhouse Square neighborhood, but needed more than just foot traffic to drive the brand awareness and results it wanted. With the pop-up shop only slated to run from May through July, Endeavor engaged Slice to drive media coverage, coordinate events in the space and increase brand recognition and reputation.

## Insight

We began by diving into Endeavor’s target audiences and competition, as well as what differentiates it from other brands in the athletic apparel market. Endeavor’s focus on the highest quality fabric technologies and its view that athletic apparel is athletic equipment immediately set it apart from its competition and became the backbone of our messaging. We created a positioning statement, point of view and key messages for Endeavor, and used those as the driving force for the rest of the PR strategy.

Since Endeavor’s pop-up was an aesthetically pleasing, open space, hosting events was a natural fit. We connected the Endeavor team with a variety of organizations, all of which mirrored their target audiences, to host events in the space.

We also hosted media tours of the pop-up shop and coordinated interviews between Endeavor’s leadership team and key members of the media, including Philadelphia Inquirer fashion columnist Elizabeth Wellington.

## Success

In addition to media placements in three of the top Philadelphia publications – the [Philadelphia Inquirer](http://www.philly.com/philly/columnists/elizabeth_wellington/endeavor-colby-cohen-under-armour-20180524.html), [Philadelphia Business Journal](https://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2018/05/01/endeavor-workout-clothes-retail-pop-up-stone-harbo.html), and [Philadelphia Magazine](https://www.phillymag.com/be-well-philly/2018/04/09/endeavor-athletic-wear-philadelphia/) – Endeavor hosted 12 events in the space, increasing brand recognition and reputation in the region.
