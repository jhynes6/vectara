# 4 Tips to Make Your Email Stand Out

Written by: Leo Manning

Each day, the average person [receives 121 emails](https://expandedramblings.com/index.php/email-statistics/). That means that your email marketing messages are forced to compete for attention in inboxes cluttered with newsletters, receipts, general correspondence, spam, and more. However, what gets an email the attention it needs so that it gets opened? Here are some [email marketing tips](https://slicecommunications.com/email-marketing) to optimize your email strategy and therefore boost your open rates.

## Sender Name

If you don’t know who is sending you an email, why would you open it? When sending out an email campaign, you need to choose a sender name that is recognizable to your target list. For example, if you are sending out a newsletter to your entire list, it would make sense to use your company’s name as the sender. However, if you are sending a follow up after a conference, the company name may not be as recognizable. Instead, use the name of the person who attended the conference from your company.

## Emoji

Normally reserved for social media, emoji are a great way to stand out in someone’s inbox. Unlike normal text and numerical characters, emojis are colorful and add a vivid pop when present in your inbox. However, they need to be used tactically based on your target audience; for example, if you are a lifestyle brand or a retail product, colorful emojis can be a major asset. On the other hand, more serious B2B companies might find them to be too comical or unprofessional.

## Personalization

Today, more than in the past, it is important for the contact to seem personalized to each recipient. While that might not always be possible, it is easy to make some small changes to personalize, such as adding a first name. If someone were to call your name, you instinctively look. The same thing often happens with email – by adding your recipient’s first name, you draw their attention and make it seem like the content is personalized for them.

## Preview Text

The preview text of an email normally appears to the right of the subject line or right below (depending on your email provider). Although only a few characters, it serves as an additional way to get your message across to your readers. Normally, the preview text is determined by the first lines of your email. This can sometimes work if your email gets to the point immediately. However, emails often contain header information that does not give a lot of information – such as “Preview in Browser.” To make the best use of the preview text, it makes sense to summarize the core message of your email in a way that complements the subject line. For example, if your subject line talks about an upcoming webinar, the preview text could mention the speakers by name to help get the message across.
