# Be Well Philly

## Challenge

[Be Well Philly](https://www.phillymag.com/be-well-philly/) had a small yet tight-knit community on social media. However, it lacked interaction, and so they were looking for a creative way to generate quality content that could both drive interaction and grow the community.

Slice’s goal was to increase “likes” on their Facebook page, which would help to increase their community and brand awareness while identifying top health influencers in the Philadelphia region.

## Insight

To generate likes, we began the Health Hero Challenge to interact with the region’s health and fitness community in a fun and engaging way. The campaign was developed as a three-phase challenge where the community would nominate individuals who had an impact on both their health and the health of the community at large. Once nominations were in and the semi-finalists were chosen, the community was asked to vote for the final four Health Heroes. From the final four, the winner was then announced to the community live at a celebration and broadcast over Facebook.

The contest ran from June through October, driven by Facebook ads and social engagement. By splitting up the contest into phases, we could generate additional excitement and buzz and prevent a drop-off rate from community members. Coinciding with the launch, Slice Communications reached out to influencers in the health and fitness community, as well as Philadelphia influencers such as the Mayor.

The combination of a multi-faceted social media campaign along with Facebook advertisements secured that all those in the health and fitness community would think “Be Well Philly” when the phrase “Health Hero” was mentioned.

## Success

During the Health Hero Challenge, Slice Communications received 500 nominations and over 10,000 votes throughout the entire challenge.

After the completion of the Health Hero Challenge, Slice Communications attracted over 7,000 new likes, reached over 2 million people, doubled the Twitter following, and increased visits to the website by 32 percent. Overall, this helped establish a strong following of community members who now look to Be Well Philly for all of their updates on Philadelphia Health and Fitness news.
