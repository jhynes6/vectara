# The Slice Squad

**No matter how you Slice it, we support our Slice Squad**

Slice Communications strives to provide a friendly environment in which _goal-oriented, always learning_ individuals work together with “_yes, and” energy_ and _copilot attitude_ to achieve our clients’ goals and help them grow. Slice’s commitment to serving our clients and to providing high quality social media, content strategy, email, and media relations support is what drives us to get attention for our clients to ensure success, achieve personal achievements through professional and personal goals, and provide support for each other and the company on a consistent basis. Such drive, energy, goal-setting, and authentic living of Slice’s values continuously provide a work environment that serves both clients’ interests and employees’ interests. We run our business on the Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS), as outlined in the book _Traction_. Utilizing the EOS model makes our company extremely goal-oriented and has a high level of transparency across the agency.

Every quarter our leadership team hosts an all-staff meeting where they share updates on how we’re performing against our business goals as well as finances. The agency’s goals are clear and discussed regularly among the team along with a clear line of processes and accountability to achieve each goal. We also operate using scorecards to track our, and our clients, performance week after week. As a data-driven company, being able to see how we’re performing against our KPIs every week attributes to our transparent culture.

## **Our Core Values**

*   _**Yes, And Energy**  –_ This is all about creating a collaborative, positive working relationship with our clients. It means that we’re willing to do anything in our power to find creative solutions to their marketing challenges, and to go that extra mile to get results.
*   _**Goal-Oriented Focus**_ – It means we are those people who are always setting and achieving goals driven by a clear understanding of our clients’ business objectives. We maintain a laser-like focus on what matters most to our clients and use that focus to guide our decision-making and prioritize our activities.
*   _**Co-Pilot Attitude**_ – We work at an agency because we are dedicated to helping people get where they’re going. Being the co-pilot means leading and guiding them, being proactive and predictive, and sometimes challenging their expectations and perceptions.
*   _**Always Learning**_ – We believe the best way to stay ahead of the curve is to always be seeking out new knowledge, skills, and insights.  And sharing our expertise by writing our own marketing books, starting a conference that turned into its own nonprofit organization (Social Media Day Philadelphia), and launching Slice University, a program that provides team members with education, training, insights, and professional development opportunities..

## **Dedication to Professional Development**

### **Slice University**

CEO [Cass Bailey](https://slicecommunications.com/team-member/cassandra-bailey) created a professional development program featuring guest speakers covering a variety of topics from unconscious bias to public speaking, media training, and everything in between to better educate our team.

### **Internal Learning Opportunities**

Here at Slice we never stop learning. Each week a team member leads a session covering anything from industry best practices, teaching new skills, working through common issues, and more.

### **Thought Leadership Opportunities**

All Slice Squad members are experts in their respective fields and we want everyone to know! We work hard to [secure media placements](https://slicecommunications.com/news-and-events/slice-news) and speaking opportunities for our team to share their expertise and establish themselves as thought leaders in their industry.

### **Slice’s Mentorship Program**

Slice Communications believes in the power of mentorship. That’s why we offer to connect all of our team members with the best industry professionals in our community. Based on individual goals, professional development needs, and communication style we work to find the best pairing.

### **Individual Professional Growth Plans**

Each quarter team member meets with their supervisors to discuss their long-term professional goals and map out a plan to reach their goal. Whether it’s leveraging the team’s personal network to find a mentor or getting you a certification, Slice is dedicated to supporting each team member’s growth.

## **Life at Slice**

### **Team Get-Togethers**

We value making memories together. Whether it’s a PowerPoint party, breakfasts in the office, or trips to the Philadelphia Zoo or Flower Show, Wilmington’s _Kalmar Nyckel_ or Constitution Yards, we think it’s important to take a step away from our work to have some fun together.

### **[Social Media Day PHL](https://smdayphl.com/)**

Although we’ve successfully transitioned planning of the incredible #SMDayPHL conference to its board, our team gets together every year to support and sponsor the event – and, of course, to keep learning from other industry leaders. (You’ll often find our team on the presenter roll!)

### **Annual Holiday Party**

Regardless of location, our team comes together every holiday season for an evening of celebration and team bonding. Each year, Cass secretly plans the party and emails clues every day the week of the party bringing the team together to hash out the meaning of each clue.

### **Hybrid Work Environment**

We have made the transition to hybrid working allowing our employees to choose where they prefer to work. Whether it’s from the comfort of their home or in one of our two co-working spaces located in Center City Philadelphia and downtown Wilmington, DE we still maintain our ability to collaborate as a team.
