Hassan D. Moore is the Vice President and Manager of DE&I Initiatives at Univest Financial Corporation. Prior to joining Univest, he served as the Manager of Supplier Diversity at [Temple University](https://www.temple.edu) – the first position of its kind at the university. In this role, he was responsible for overseeing the supplier diversity efforts across the institution and increasing the participation of Minority Business Enterprises (MBEs), Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBEs), Women’s Business Enterprises (WBEs), and Small Business Enterprises (SBEs), through university procurement and contracting opportunities. In 2019 he was certified by the National Association of Educational Procurement (NAEP) in Establishing an Impactful Supplier Diversity Program through the NAEP’s Supplier Diversity Institute.

Hassan has over 12 years of professional experience working in the healthcare industry with a focus on community advocacy and improvement. He has worked closely with community organizations, small businesses, and non-profits throughout his career, which led him to his current role at Temple.

He also earned Construction Management Certification through Temple in 2016.

Hassan was born and raised in Philadelphia and spent much of his youth working for his father who is a small business owner. This experience ignited his passion to serve the needs of the communities in which he was raised.

Most recently, he served on the boards of The Food Trust Program and Get HYPE Philly.
