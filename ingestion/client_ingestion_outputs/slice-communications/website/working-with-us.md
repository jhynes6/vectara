# Working with Us

There is a secret no one really talks about when hiring an agency: reliability. The client-agency depends on trust, and there’s no way to have trust without reliability.

Over the years, we’ve developed unique systems and processes to ensure that our clients can rely on our team at Slice. Some of them include:

* **Scorecards** – Most of the time, goals and objectives show up on a slide in a strategy presentation only to never be seen again. Our approach is different. We make sure all of our goals are SMART: specific, measurable, actionable, realistic, and time-bound. Once our clients have approved them, we put them into a spreadsheet. Every week, we review them with our clients to identify which are on-track and which are off-track. This means we remain focused on them, and our clients can rely on us to deliver results. If goals get out of our reach, our clients can also be sure that we’ll have open and honest conversations about why. We’re always looking out for them.
* **Meeting Ratings** – At the end of meeting, all the members of the client-agency team get to rate the meeting from 1 to 10. Great meetings start and end on time, focus on critical opportunities and issues, and identify things we can all do to make sure we achieve our goals. Low rated meetings start late, are disorganized, and are unfocused. These are more like status updates instead of real opportunities to work together to solve problems. Our clients have an opportunity every single week to let us know if we’re not delivering value, which ensures that we always do.
* **Our Values** – One of our company’s core values is “hustle.” We hire, review, and fire based on our team’s ability to get things done on time and on budget. This means that we reply to emails quickly, we use our time efficiently, and we get things done. It’s part of who we are as people, which is why clients can rely on it.

## Many of our clients have praised our reliability:

“The whole team has been a pleasure to work with. They’ve listened to any comments or concerns professionally and are always ready with new ideas and solutions for our team. In addition, the content they create is high quality and engaging our audience.”

“It is a pleasure working with Slice. They have been able to capture the overall look and feel of the concession program activity. We receive feedback about our posts regularly.”
