# Aching Ovaries During Menopause: Causes and Relief

*   Posted on September 27, 2025
*   By SensIQ

Many women experience aching ovaries during menopause, and ongoing pain should not be ignored. Causes range from ovarian cysts and uterine fibroids to bladder or digestive issues. Pain on the left or right side after menopause may signal different conditions.

Doctors use exams, imaging tests, and lab work to diagnose, and while lifestyle changes may help, severe pain requires medical care.

Many women feel worried when they notice aching ovaries during menopause. It can be hard to know if the pain is normal or if it means something more serious. SensIQ, led by Dr. Luke Barr, helps women understand these changes with science-based guidance and support.

### Key Takeaways

*   Many women experience aching ovaries during menopause, but new or persistent pain should not be ignored.
*   Common causes include ovarian cysts, uterine fibroids, digestive issues, or bladder problems that can mimic ovarian pain.
*   Location-specific pain, such as left or right side ovary pain after menopause, may signal different underlying conditions.
*   Doctors use medical history, physical exams, imaging tests, and lab work to find the cause and guide safe treatment.
*   Lifestyle changes may help mild symptoms, but ongoing or severe ovarian pain requires medical care to rule out serious health conditions.

## Do Ovaries Ache During Menopause?

Some women do feel ovarian pain during menopause. It may come from changing hormones, but not all pain should be ignored. Menopause symptoms can overlap with other pelvic pains that need a doctor’s attention.

A drop in estrogen and progesterone during this time can affect the menstrual cycle and cause aches in the pelvic region. These shifts may lead to cramping, bloating, or general abdominal pain.

Women often ask if pain happens after menopause, too. Yes – sometimes ovaries ache after menopause, often due to other health issues. Any new or lasting pain should be checked by a professional.

## Common Causes of Ovary Pain

Many health conditions can cause or mimic ovarian discomfort in menopause. Understanding these helps women separate normal changes from problems that need care.

**Gynecologic causes** are the most common. Ovarian cysts, which are fluid-filled sacs, may form even after periods have stopped. Some cysts shrink on their own, but larger ones can press on surrounding tissue and lead to abdominal cramps or pain that feels like menstrual cramps.

**Uterine fibroids** are another example. These growths inside or around the uterus can cause pressure in the pelvic region, heavy bleeding during perimenopause, or a dull ache that lingers.

**Non-gynecologic causes** also play a role. Pain from the bladder, intestines, or lower back muscles can radiate into the pelvic area and feel like it is coming from the ovaries.

For example, constipation, urinary tract infections, or hernias can all trigger discomfort that may be confused with ovarian pain. Because many organs share the same nerve pathways, the source of pain is not always obvious.

Some women also notice ovarian pain and bloating in menopause. This combination may be linked to hormone fluctuations, changes in digestion, or benign ovarian growths. While bloating is often harmless, new or worsening swelling in the abdomen should be checked to rule out more serious conditions.

Finally, there is a rare but confusing situation called “rogue ovulation after menopause.” In very uncommon cases, the ovaries may still release an egg or show brief hormonal activity. This can cause short-term pain similar to ovulation cramps. Although it is unusual, it is important for women to be aware of it so they know to discuss it with a doctor if symptoms appear.

## Location-Specific Ovary Pain

Some women feel pain more on one side. Left side ovary pain after menopause may come from cysts, fibroids, or bowel problems. Right-sided ovarian pain after menopause may be linked to ovarian cysts, appendix issues, or gallbladder pain.

Because the fallopian tube, bladder, and intestines are close together, the pain location is not always clear. That is why a doctor’s exam is important.

## When to Seek Medical Help

It is time to see a doctor if the pain does not go away or gets worse. Ongoing pain is not a normal part of menopause.

Seek urgent care if you feel sudden, severe, or one-sided pain. Warning signs include fever, nausea, or quick belly swelling. These can point to serious issues that need fast treatment.

## How Doctors Diagnose Ovary Pain

Doctors start with a medical history and a physical exam. They may also do a pelvic exam to check for swelling or tenderness.

Next, they order imaging tests like an ultrasound or a CT scan. These help detect cysts, uterine fibroids, or other problems in the pelvic region.

Blood tests may be used to check estrogen levels, other hormones, or markers for disease. With these steps, doctors can identify the cause and choose safe care.

## Treatment and Relief Options

Treatment depends on the cause. Doctors often suggest simple treatment options first.

*   Heat packs for abdominal cramps
*   Gentle exercise to reduce stiffness
*   Relaxation methods to ease mood swings and tension

If needed, medical care may include hormone therapy, surgery for large cysts, or other targeted care. For pain not linked to the ovaries, treatment is tailored to the condition.

Prevention matters too. Regular checkups and tracking of menopause symptoms help spot problems early. SensIQ supports women during this stage, but it does not replace medical treatment.

## Hormonal Changes and Menopause

During perimenopause, changing estrogen and progesterone can trigger pelvic pains and feelings like menstrual cramps. Women may also feel abdominal pain, bloating, or mood changes.

In postmenopause, hormones are lower, so pain is less tied to cycles. Pain at this stage is more likely from a health condition such as cysts or fibroids. Knowing the difference helps women understand their symptoms better.

## FAQs About Ovary Pain After Menopause

## Is pain common after menopause?

It is not very common, but some women still feel pain. Causes include cysts, fibroids, or issues outside the ovaries.

## Can ovarian pain come and go?

Yes. Pain may happen off and on, often linked to fluid-filled sacs, digestive issues, or muscle strain. Recurring pain should still be checked.

Women facing ovarian pain after menopause should know they are not alone. With clear answers, safe treatment options, and expert support, women experience more control and less fear. Under the guidance of Dr. Luke Barr, SensIQ helps women manage midlife changes with care and science.
