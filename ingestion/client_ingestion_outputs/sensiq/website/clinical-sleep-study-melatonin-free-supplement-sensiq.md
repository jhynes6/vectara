As Chief Medical Officer for SensIQ, I recently had the opportunity to present the results of our latest clinical study, this time focused on improving sleep quality without the use of melatonin. With sleep disorders affecting millions of people—and melatonin-based supplements raising questions around long-term use and tolerance—we set out to explore a more holistic, non-hormonal approach.

During the webinar, I began by outlining the challenges of generalized insomnia, which affects over 10% of the population and is often driven by a combination of stress, lifestyle factors, and physiological disruptions. Traditional pharmacologic treatments like benzodiazepines, Z-drugs, and sedating antidepressants can be effective, but often come with dependency risks, tolerance issues, or unwanted side effects.

This is where SensIQ Sleep comes in. We developed a melatonin-free formula built around pharmaceutical-grade ingredients including **Reishi mushroom**, **Magnesium Bisglycinate**, **L-Theanine**, **Valerian root**, and **Ashwagandha**. Each was selected for its clinically studied ability to support the parasympathetic nervous system, reduce cortisol and nighttime anxiety, and promote deeper, more restorative sleep.

We conducted a 7-day clinical trial with 40 participants experiencing sleep complaints or meeting the diagnostic criteria for generalized insomnia. Participants took 2–3 capsules nightly, depending on weight, and were evaluated using validated tools including the **PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Score** and the **PGIC (Patient Global Impression of Change)**.

The results were remarkable:  
We observed a **62% improvement in sleep quality** in just one week. Participants reported falling asleep faster, sleeping more soundly, and waking up feeling more refreshed. There were no serious adverse effects reported. Interestingly, a few participants noted vivid dreaming—an indication of enhanced REM sleep, which is often suppressed in chronic stress states.

This study was also selected for presentation at the **A4M (American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine) Spring Congress**, a leading event for innovation in integrative and longevity-focused healthcare. It’s a testament to the growing recognition that plant-based, neuro-supportive compounds can play a powerful role in addressing modern sleep challenges.

For practitioners seeking safe, effective, and evidence-based tools to support sleep—without melatonin—**SensIQ Sleep** offers a compelling solution rooted in clinical data and systems biology. I’m proud to be part of this work and look forward to continued research that pushes the boundaries of what’s possible in natural sleep support.
