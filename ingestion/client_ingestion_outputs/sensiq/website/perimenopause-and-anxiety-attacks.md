# Perimenopause and Anxiety Attacks: Causes and Symptoms

*   Posted on August 31, 2025
*   By SensIQ

Many women experience perimenopause and anxiety attacks in their late 30s and 40s. SensIQ, built by neurologists, helps women understand these changes and offers support. Dr. Luke Barr, Chief Medical Officer, notes that the right guidance can make symptoms easier to manage.

## Key Takeaways

*   Hormonal changes in estrogen and progesterone during perimenopause can trigger anxiety and panic attacks, often worsened by stress and poor sleep.
*   Symptoms may appear as emotional changes, physical signs like chest pain or racing heart, and nocturnal panic attacks that disrupt sleep.
*   Anxiety during perimenopause can last for months or years, and in some cases may continue into menopause if hormone levels remain low.
*   Treatments include talk therapy, short-term medication, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), and lifestyle adjustments such as exercise, sleep routines, and relaxation techniques.
*   Evidence suggests supplements like ashwagandha may support stress regulation and improve resilience, though medical guidance is always recommended.

## Why Perimenopause Triggers Panic Attacks

Hormone shifts during perimenopause affect the brain and body. These changes can increase anxiety and cause panic episodes. They are real, not imagined, and often link to changes in sleep and mood.

### Hormonal shifts and low estrogen panic attacks

Falling estrogen levels and changes in progesterone impact brain chemicals that control calmness. This may lead to low estrogen panic attacks, where sudden fear or a racing heartbeat appears. These attacks often vary with the menstrual cycle, making them hard to predict.

### Stress, sleep loss, and lifestyle triggers

Outside stress can worsen symptoms. Poor sleep, heavy workloads, or family demands raise the risk of anxiety during perimenopause. Over time, these triggers may lead to frequent panic disorders or ongoing worry.

## Recognizing Anxiety Symptoms in Perimenopause

Anxiety shows up in both the body and the mind. Understanding these signs helps women know what is happening.

### Emotional symptoms of perimenopause

Changes can include mood swings, sadness, or sudden feelings of anxiety. These symptoms of perimenopause overlap with symptoms of anxiety, which can be confusing.

### Physical signs and morning anxiety

Women may wake up already feeling anxious, with a fast heartbeat or chest pain. These are physical symptoms of a body under stress. They often happen even without a clear cause.

### Panic attacks at night and nocturnal episodes

Menopause panic attacks at night can wake women suddenly. They may feel sweaty, breathless, or fearful. This poor sleep then makes daytime anxiety worse.

### Patient voices: perimenopause anxiety stories

Many women share perimenopause anxiety stories about panic disrupting family or work life. Hearing these stories shows that others face the same struggle.

## How Long Does Perimenopause Anxiety Last?

Anxiety during this stage does not follow one set timeline. It can last months or years.

### Typical duration, and does it go away?

For many, symptoms last for several years. The answer to how long does perimenopause anxiety last depends on hormones and lifestyle. For example, shifts in cycle patterns may signal hormonal changes that influence mood and anxiety.

Some women improve as hormone levels stabilize, while others continue to feel anxious.

### Anxiety that continues into menopause

Some women experience anxiety, menopause, panic attacks, even after their periods stop. Low oestrogen levels can affect mood in the long term, linking anxiety to both perimenopause and menopause.

## Perimenopause Panic Attack Treatment

Care works best when it combines medical help and lifestyle changes.

### Medical and therapy options

Doctors may suggest talk therapy to manage fear and worry. Therapy helps women spot thought patterns that trigger panic. Some may also receive short-term medicine.

### Best HRT for perimenopause anxiety

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can help when symptoms are severe. Balancing estrogen and progesterone may ease hot flushes, improve sleep, and reduce mood swings. Not everyone can use HRT, so a doctor must decide.

### Other options: what to take for menopause anxiety

Beyond HRT, options include anti-anxiety drugs, antidepressants, or safe supplements. These are often used if panic disorders affect daily life.

### Lifestyle changes and coping strategies

Every day steps can improve the quality of life:

*   Exercise regularly.
*   Limit caffeine and alcohol.
*   Practice breathing or mindfulness.
*   Keep a steady sleep schedule.

These changes ease common symptoms like fatigue and mood swings.

### Evidence-backed supplements

Research suggests some supplements to calm the nervous system may help with stress regulation. One example is ashwagandha, which has been studied for its potential role in lowering stress and improving resilience to anxiety triggers. While not a cure, evidence indicates that it may support women experiencing psychological symptoms linked to hormonal changes.

SensIQ uses these findings to design doctor-formulated protocols that give women structured support during perimenopause and menopause.

## FAQs on Perimenopause and Anxiety Attacks

### Can perimenopause cause panic attacks?

Yes. Hormone changes can affect mood and stress response. This may trigger panic attacks with sudden fear, fast heartbeat, or breathlessness. Many women face this during perimenopause.

### How long does perimenopause anxiety last?

It depends. Some women feel anxious for only a few months. Others may have symptoms for years, and in some cases, anxiety continues into menopause.

### How do you treat perimenopause anxiety?

Care often combines medical help and lifestyle steps. Options include talk therapy, HRT, or short-term medicine. Exercise, rest, and stress management also support recovery.

## When to Seek Medical Help

Sometimes anxiety is a sign of a more serious problem.

### Red flags to discuss with your doctor

See a doctor if panic causes fainting, strong chest pain, or if anxiety blocks daily tasks. These may signal conditions beyond hormone changes.

### Key questions to ask at appointments

Prepare questions such as:

*   Could hormones be the cause?
*   What tests confirm it?
*   Am I a candidate for HRT?
*   What lifestyle steps should I focus on?

## Key Takeaway: Youâ€™re Not Alone

Perimenopause and anxiety attacks are common and treatable. With guidance, lifestyle changes, and tools like SensIQ, women can regain focus and calm. Dr. Ross Kopelman reminds women that they do not have to face this stage alone.
