The global pandemic has left an indelible mark on our society, not just in terms of immediate health concerns but also the lingering effects known as long COVID. As the world grapples with these prolonged symptoms, a recent study from the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) has shed light on the potential role of nootropics and adaptogens in aiding recovery.

## **The Penn Medical Revelation**

The [Penn Medical study](https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2023/october/penn-study-finds-serotonin-reduction-causes-long-covid-symptoms#:~:text=PHILADELPHIA—Patients%20with%20long%20COVID,research%20published%20today%20in%20Cell.) revealed that patients with long COVID exhibit a reduction in circulating levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin. This reduction is linked to persistent inflammation caused by traces of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the gut, even months after the acute phase of the infection. This inflammation disrupts the absorption of the amino acid tryptophan, a precursor to serotonin, leading to a range of neurological symptoms, including memory loss.

### **Nootropics and Adaptogens in Long COVID Recovery**

Nootropics, often dubbed “[smart drugs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9415189/),” and adaptogens, natural substances known for combating stress, have long been celebrated for their cognitive-enhancing properties. Given the Penn findings, there’s a compelling case for their potential to address the serotonin deficiency seen in long COVID patients.

For instance, certain nootropics can support neurotransmitter production and function, potentially aiding in restoring serotonin levels, and mental performance. Adaptogens, on the other hand, can combat the stress and inflammation that exacerbate serotonin depletion.
