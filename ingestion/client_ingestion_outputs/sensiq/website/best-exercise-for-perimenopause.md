# Best Exercise for Perimenopause: Expert Guide for Women

The best exercise for perimenopause is a balanced routine that combines resistance training, cardiovascular activity, and flexibility workouts. Strength training supports bone and muscle health, cardio improves heart and weight control, and practices like yoga or Pilates help with stress and sleep.

At SensIQ, Dr. Luke Barr explains how these exercises work together to ease symptoms, boost energy, and support long-term well-being.

### Key Takeaways

* Regular physical activity during perimenopause helps manage weight gain, improve body composition, and support bone health while reducing the risk of chronic disease.
* A balanced routine that combines resistance training, cardio, and flexibility exercises provides the best workouts for perimenopause, improving both physical and mental well-being.
* Diet choices, such as lean protein and whole grains, work alongside exercise, and emerging evidence suggests creatine supplementation may further support muscle strength when paired with strength training.
* Practical strategies, such as a 7-day workout plan, adapting exercise intensity, and avoiding common mistakes, make it easier for women to maintain consistency and achieve long-term benefits.
* Consulting a doctor before starting a new program ensures safety, especially for women with medical conditions, and reinforces an evidence-based approach to women’s health.

## Why Exercise Matters in Perimenopause

### How hormones affect weight, mood, and energy

Perimenopause and menopause involve shifts in estrogen levels that influence body composition, mood, and energy. Declining hormones can make it easier to gain body fat and harder to build muscle strength.

These changes may also reduce the ability to recover quickly from physical activity. Regular exercise helps stabilise body weight, improves heart rate control, and supports emotional health.

### Common symptoms that exercise can improve.

Physical activity can ease common menopausal symptoms such as fatigue, mood swings, and sleep problems. Research suggests that exercise may also help reduce the risk of chronic conditions linked to aging. Women’s health experts recommend consistent routines to improve quality of life during this transition.

### Exercise for stress and brain fog

Stress and brain fog are frequent concerns in perimenopause. Aerobic activity and strength training increase blood flow to the brain, which may improve focus and help women feel good. Gentle practices, such as yoga or Pilates, can support relaxation and promote better sleep.

## Best Workouts for Perimenopause

### Resistance training for perimenopause (strength program basics)

Resistance training for perimenopause is one of the most effective ways to support bone health and maintain muscle mass. Lifting weights two to three times a week can help preserve bone density and muscle strength. Start with light dumbbells or bodyweight exercises, and gradually increase the intensity of exercise over time.

### Cardio for energy and weight management

Cardiovascular workouts help balance body weight and improve heart health. Activities like brisk walking, swimming, or cycling raise heart rate and support fat metabolism. Aim for moderate cardio sessions several times a week to boost endurance and reduce the risk of heart disease.

### Yoga and Pilates for stress relief and flexibility

Yoga and Pilates are ideal complements to strength training. These activities focus on flexibility, core stability, and controlled breathing. They may help alleviate menopausal symptoms such as stiffness and tension, while promoting a sense of calmness.

### Is cardio better than weights for perimenopause?

Both cardio and strength training provide unique benefits. Cardio improves heart rate and body fat control, while strength training builds muscle strength and bone health. A balanced program that includes both is considered the best workout for perimenopause.

## Exercise for Weight Gain and Weight Loss

### Best exercise for perimenopause weight gain

Many women notice weight gain during perimenopause, especially around the abdomen. Combining resistance training and moderate cardio can help manage body composition. Short sessions of high-intensity exercise may also improve calorie use and metabolism.

### Best exercises for weight loss and belly fat

Weight loss and belly fat reduction are common goals. Cardio sessions paired with strength training offer effective results. For example, a workout routine might include lifting weights twice a week and three cardio sessions of 30 minutes each.

### How to lose weight in perimenopause

Losing weight during perimenopause requires a combination of exercise and a balanced diet. Focus on portion control, balanced meals, and regular physical activity. Practical strategies include walking daily, lifting weights, and monitoring body weight changes.

## Exercise and Diet Strategies

### Perimenopause exercise and diet tips

Diet and exercise work best together. A balanced diet rich in lean protein, whole grains, and vegetables supports muscle strength and recovery. Staying hydrated and limiting processed foods can also improve results.

### Sample meal and workout pairings

* **Morning:** Oatmeal with fruit, followed by a brisk 20-minute walk.
* **Afternoon:** Grilled chicken salad, then resistance training.
* **Evening:** Salmon with vegetables, paired with gentle yoga.

These simple pairings demonstrate how food and physical activity complement each other for improved outcomes.

### Evidence on creatine support

Emerging evidence suggests that creatine supplementation may help support muscle strength and body composition in women during perimenopause and menopause. A recent study found that creatine could contribute to improved physical function and exercise outcomes in midlife women, particularly when combined with resistance training. SensIQ’s Clarity supplement, which contains creatine as part of its formula, reflects this evidence-based approach.

Dr. Luke Barr and the SensIQ team highlight these findings to help women make informed decisions, while noting that supplement choices should always be discussed with a healthcare professional.

## Free Perimenopause Workout Plan

### 7-day beginner-friendly plan

Here is an example of a weekly plan for perimenopausal women:

* **Day 1:** Strength training – bodyweight exercises
* **Day 2:** 30-minute brisk walk
* **Day 3:** Yoga or Pilates
* **Day 4:** Strength training – lifting weights
* **Day 5:** Swimming or cycling
* **Day 6:** Light cardio – easy jog or walk
* **Day 7:** Rest or gentle stretching

### How to adapt it to your lifestyle

Adjust the plan based on fitness level, available time, and personal preference. Aim for at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week, spread over several days. Modify intensity exercise and duration as needed, focusing on progress rather than perfection.

## Building a Safe and Sustainable Routine

### How often to exercise in perimenopause

Experts suggest exercising three to five times a week. This frequency helps manage menopausal symptoms and supports long-term health. Combining different types of workouts prevents overuse and keeps routines enjoyable.

### Adapting intensity to your fitness level

Start with low to moderate intensity exercise and increase gradually. Pay attention to how your body responds and rest as needed. Tracking heart rate during sessions can guide effort and avoid strain.

### Common workout mistakes to avoid

* Skipping warm-up or cool-down
* Overtraining without rest days
* Ignoring form during lifting weights

Avoiding these mistakes helps reduce the risk of injury and supports steady progress.

## Lifestyle Habits That Boost Results

### Sleep and recovery strategies

Quality sleep supports muscle recovery and hormonal balance. Establishing a regular bedtime and limiting caffeine intake can improve sleep quality. Good recovery habits make exercise more effective and help women feel good.

### Stress management for hormonal balance

Stress can worsen body fat accumulation and affect overall health. Practising mindful breathing, yoga, or taking daily walks can help reduce stress levels. Lower stress helps improve body composition and supports women’s health.

## When to Consult a Doctor Before Exercising

Before starting a new program, women should consult a doctor, especially if they have medical conditions. A healthcare professional can recommend safe modifications and screen for risks. Dr Luke Barr, Chief Medical Officer at SensIQ, emphasises that medical review is an important step in protecting women’s health while building sustainable routines.
