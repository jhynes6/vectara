As Chief Medical Officer for SensIQ, I recently had the privilege of presenting some impressive results from our latest study on the company’s new Focus formula. It was an exciting opportunity to share insights into the challenges of maintaining focus in today’s fast-paced world, as well as how our innovative supplement is helping people achieve their cognitive potential.

During the webinar, I began by discussing the growing pandemic of distractibility we’re facing. Citing data that over 90% of people struggle with focus on a daily basis, and have reduced attention spans. There has been a significant rise in [ADHD](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/adhd/what-is-adhd) diagnoses among adults, as well as stimulant medication prescriptions.

Addressing this challenge, the team at SensIQ developed a comprehensive [Focus](https://sensiqnootropics.com//products/focus/) formula combining fast-acting and long-term cognitive enhancers. Ingredients like rhodiola, l-theanine, lions mane, and the acetylcholine precursor AlphaGPC work synergistically to improve focus, attention, and mood.

During the webinar, we highlighted a recent study we conducted involving doctoral students who took Focus before their biochemistry exams. We used crossover design to better measure the effects.  
The results were nothing short of remarkable. Within just one hour of taking our Focus, 75% of participants saw an increase in test performance. Standard-performers improved by an average of 27%, while the high-performers saw a 17% boost. Importantly, these benefits were sustained even after participants stopped taking the supplement.

As I emphasized during the webinar, these findings demonstrate the power of SensIQ’s Focus formula to rapidly and significantly enhance cognitive function, even for high-performing individuals. The crossover design also provided a robust, real-world assessment of the supplement’s efficacy.

I’m incredibly proud of these results and what they mean for our customers. For healthcare practitioners and their patients seeking natural ways to boost focus, attention, and mental performance, Focus appears to be a promising option.
