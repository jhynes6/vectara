## Key Ingredients in SensIQ Calm: Supplements to Calm the Nervous System

### Magnesium: Nervous System Health and Relaxation

Magnesium is vital for regulating the nervous system by calming nerve activity and reducing the symptoms of anxiety. It also promotes relaxation by encouraging the production of GABA, a neurotransmitter that reduces nerve excitability and stress.

### L-Tyrosine: Mood and Cognitive Function Support

This amino acid plays a crucial role in producing neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine. During times of stress, L-Tyrosine helps maintain mental performance, improving mood and cognitive function while easing tension on the nervous system.

### Ashwagandha: Stress Relief and Cortisol Balance

Known for its adaptogenic properties, Ashwagandha helps regulate cortisol, the stress hormone, which reduces stress and anxiety. By balancing stress responses, it promotes a calm, relaxed state, making it a key ingredient for nervous system support.

### Reishi Mushroom: Immune and Emotional Stability

Traditional medicine reveres Reishi for its calming effects on the nervous system. It helps maintain emotional balance by lowering stress and anxiety. It also boosts immune function. This makes it a good choice for overall well-being and nervous system health.

### Valerian Root: Natural Relaxation Aid

Known as a natural sedative, Valerian Root has been used for centuries to promote relaxation and improve sleep. It works by increasing the levels of GABA in the brain, helping calm anxiety, soothe the nervous system, and aid in restful sleep.
