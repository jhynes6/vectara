Service Differentiation

What makes you different from your competitors? What is your “special sauce”?SensIQ is exclusively developed for and sold to healthcare practitioners, emphasizing trust through natural, high-quality, third-party-tested ingredients. Our products simplify patient recommendations by combining multiple effective nootropics and adaptogens into single formulations, backed by a Medical Advisory Board of doctors, including a neurologist as Chief Medical Officer. Competitors are on amazon, selling D2C as well causing patients to price shop and see where they can find the cheapest products. Our formulas use very potent ingredients, that create noticable differences within 1 hour of taking them (Calm and Focus). Our formulas are so effective that the menopause association made us an official partner and ranked us as the number 1 insomnia products, and it turns out we were the only product thats melatonin free. 
 We have clinical studies on our formulas, and ongoing studies as well with leading universities.
 In a clinical study, 75% of doctoral students had a measurable performance increase on exams within 1 hour of taking SensIQ Focus*
 *Average performance increase translated to an entire letter grade better. Study conducted at Campbellsville University, involving 20 doctoral students in a randomized, open-label crossover study
 Ongoing studies on stress, insomnia, Alzheimer's, and  Dementia Sponsored by the Menopause Association

Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? What do you do to improve their business?Customer Problem:
 "I struggle to find trustworthy supplements to recommend to my patients. Many patients price shop online on Amazon, which creates trust issues and undermines product efficacy."
 Solution:
 SensIQ offers a single-capsule solution combining the most effective nootropics and adaptogens that doctors would otherwise need to source individually. We help clinics boost patient trust by providing reliable, third-party-tested, natural products that can't be found on Amazon or general e-commerce platforms.

Case Studies and Previous Customer Successes

For each service, what are case studies or recent customer successes that you use to highlight your expertise in your field?
 Increased Clinic Revenue: Clinics using SensIQ’s front-desk display kits report a 28% increase in supplement sales, supported by patient education materials.
 Enhanced Patient Experience: Doctors feel confident recommending SensIQ products because they’re backed by science. By offering Focus and Calm samples, patients can experience noticeable relief within 30 minutes to an hour, which drives trust and increases likelihood of purchase.
