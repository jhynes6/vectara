Service Differentiation

What makes you different from your competitors? What is your “special sauce”?
 (ex: We implement 8 proprietary flows to maximally engage customers via email. 14 touch-points across a 30 day visit to our customers site has been proven to concert the highest % of site visits to paying and repeat customers)
 Guarantee 100% accuracy of the data provided.
 Price, Scalability, Flexibility and breadth/variety of leads available
 No long-term commitment, totally flexible, low barrier to entry.
 Minimum $1,000 order base
 Advanced filtering capabilities across job titles, industry, company size, etc. etc.
 Customized lead delivery via whatever means the client wants, any CRM, format, etc.
 Access to millions of records across every category, niche, specialty, etc.

Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? What do you do to improve their business?
 (ex: My clothing line has stopped reaching new buyers and we want to break into a new niche. Facebook keeps getting more expensive and makes it hard to target new buyers.
 Solution: Organic UGC content is the perfect mechanism to branch out to new customers. We help you find influencers who are exactly like your target audience, work with them to create videos and then use those videos to penetrate your new niche audience.)
 Price to data quality = significant limitation for clients, esp given recent cuts in SaaS/tech for example, able to deliver the same leads without the manpower or cost normally needed
