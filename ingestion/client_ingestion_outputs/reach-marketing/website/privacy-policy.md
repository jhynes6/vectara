### Use of Cookies and Browser-Level Information

A “cookie” is a small piece of information that a website can store in a designated file on your computer or Web-enabled device. Cookies can be used, among other things, to identify your computer or device when you log into a website and may track your IP address in order to do so.

When you visit our website, we use cookies to collect aggregate information on the number of visitors to our site and the number of pages viewed. Reach Marketing does an analysis of its website logs to monitor the flow of traffic and make improvements to the site’s content. This information is used only by Reach Marketing and its agents or contractors and is not shared with any third-party companies.

If you register through our website, we place a unique identifier cookie that is used to maintain your “sign on” status for the duration of your visit to the site, customize or tailor your visit and to store your user preferences for that site over time. We also use cookies to track the pages visited so that we can deliver content based on a visitor’s profile (as provided by the visitor) and the visitor’s past activity on that site. The use of these cookies also enables our sites to “remember” the pages that visitors view to alert visitors to new areas that we think might be of interest to them when they return to the site, to ensure that visitors are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads, and to customize the Web page content based on a visitor’s browser type or other information that the visitor sends.

### Choices About Data Collection and Use

We may allow advertisements to be placed on our websites by third-party organizations. Those organizations may collect web-reporting data on their placed advertisements.

If you do not wish to receive information about our new products and services, third-party offers we may send you, or upcoming events, you may opt-out of receiving promotional Reach Marketing communications by sending an email request to info@reachmarketing.com. In your email, please indicate which mode(s) of communication you would like to opt-out of (postal mail, email or telephone contact).

To make such a request, please send an email to info@reachmarketing.com specifying that you seek your “California Customer Choice Notice” in the subject line.
