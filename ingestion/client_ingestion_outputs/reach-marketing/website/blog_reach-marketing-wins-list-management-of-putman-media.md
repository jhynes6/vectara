# Reach Marketing Wins List Management of Putman Media

PEARL RIVER, N.Y.- Putman Media, a leader in business-to-business publishing for the manufacturing sector, has chosen Reach Marketing as its exclusive list manager. The Putman Media Masterfile contains 249,035 email addresses, 337,520 postal addresses, and 204,226 phone numbers. The lists were formerly managed by Infogroup.

Putman Media has 67 years of experience publishing essential content for a diverse array of professionals in the manufacturing sector. For plant operations managers, buyers, research and development specialists, CEOs and production engineers, Putman Media’s publications offer analysis and insight from other industry leaders. As Fortune 500 companies move their manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., the reliance by subscribers to Putman’s essential content will increase.

Putman Media’s suite of mastheads are designed to facilitate operations across a broad range of manufacturing and process industries such as food, chemicals, plastics, metal fabrication, machinery, and other equipment. _Plant Services and Control magazine_ offer feature articles of interest to a wide spectrum of industrial production. For more specialized audiences, titles such as _Food Processing_ and _Pharmaceutical Manufacturing_ serve the specific needs of these industries. _Sustainable Plant_ is Putman Media’s online information resource and community dedicated to advancing the sustainability of manufacturing and other industrial operations.

Greg Grdodian, Partner at Reach Marketing, said, “Putman is recognized for their award winning editorial and we are honored to represent their list assets in the marketplace.
