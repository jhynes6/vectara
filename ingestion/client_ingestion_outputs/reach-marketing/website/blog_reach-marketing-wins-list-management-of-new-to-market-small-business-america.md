# Reach Marketing Wins List Management of New to Market Small Business America

PEARL RIVER, N.Y.- Small Business America, a media property of Pure Incubation, has selected Reach Marketing as its list management company. Small Business America is an extensive opt-in network of resources and services across all industries. With an overall subscriber base of 2,769,544 small business owners and decision-makers, the Small Business America Masterfile can be segmented by industries such as manufacturing, retail, construction, and health care among others. The Masterfile also contains 2,697,982 phone numbers and 1,342,263 email addresses.

Melissa Chang, Founder and President of Pure Incubation stated, “We are confident in our decision to award our list management business to Reach Marketing. With our large, diverse list, we needed a list management firm that could generate the maximum list rental revenue possible by intelligently leveraging the subscriber data to put our audience in touch with the appropriate offers for solutions they can truly use.”

The Small Business America multichannel list focuses on companies with less than 100 employees across all business industries. Small Business America offers these companies support via an extensive list of white papers, case studies and market research. Some data is available only to subscribers while other items are visible to visitors, adding value to becoming a subscriber.

Reach Marketing Partner Greg Grdodian expressed his excitement about the announcement. “Owners and managers of small businesses are often the most motivated to improve. They’re building their dreams, and what Small Business America offers is a firm foundation for that building process. We’re proud to partner with a progressive organization such as SBA and leverage our marketing expertise and technology to deliver critical bottom-line revenue.”
