# Find Your Best Marketing Automation Vendor

Not all marketing automation options are created equal. Finding the marketing automation vendor that matches your organization’s needs will let you make the most of everything MA has to offer. In this week’s infographic, discover how to run a self-assessment to find out what you want from your marketing automation system, find out how to use reviews to make the best choice, and learn why demos are so important.

## Choosing A Marketing Automation Vendor

Do your preliminary research and view some online product demos to gain a greater understanding of the generic capabilities of marketing automation systems.

Carefully assess your marketing needs early on, before spending much time trialing any platforms. Make a list of must have versus nice-to-have features.

Identify your available resources—both the dollars and the people that can be resourced to marketing automation.

When pricing vendors, make sure to include all implementation costs and know what resources the vendor is committing for implementation.

Don’t underestimate the importance of ease of use. Product demos often give users an impression that the product is simpler than it is. Trials are much better than demos for assessing ease of use. Don’t be shy about doing several trials.

Planning for marketing automation should include not only the technical implementation but also the time and resources needed to understand/create your marketing processes.

Make sure customer support is adequate to meet your needs. Assume that you will require support in implementing some of the features of marketing automation.

Assess the vendor’s financial and business viability. Ask about the number and growth in both employees and customers. Be concerned if a vendor is laying off workers as the overall market expands.

Use crowdsourcing sites like TrustRadius to get user reviews and customer feedback about vendors you are considering.

Once you’ve gone through vendor selection and have chosen your marketing automation software, you’ll be empowered to generate and nurture leads, gain complete control over campaigns, identify your web visitors, coordinate multi-touch marketing across channels and align your content marketing with your audience.

With marketing automation, you transform your marketing department into a revenue producer that quickly processes leads through your sales pipeline.
