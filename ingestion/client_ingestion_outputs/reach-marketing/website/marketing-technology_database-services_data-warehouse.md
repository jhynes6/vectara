*   Enables Advanced Analytics: Structured, cleansed data allows businesses to perform more complex analyses, predict trends, and make data-driven decisions.
*   Increases Efficiency: Automating the ETL process streamlines data operations, reduces manual errors, and saves time, allowing teams to focus on strategic activities rather than data management tasks.
