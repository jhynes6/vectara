# Business Mailing Lists

## Improve Sales with a Targeted Business List

Quality business mailing lists provide you with accurate, updated, and affordable leads. Prospecting from a mailing list that’s been verified and enhanced for the most complete, accurate customer records is more than just a chance to establish contact. You know your new audience to an unprecedented degree even before you’ve introduced yourself, and knowing these details lets you align your message and their interests more closely than ever.

### Business Mailing Lists with Robust Selectivity

Approximately 70,000 different mailing lists are available for rental on the market, representing a combined database of some one billion names. Reach Marketing provides experienced list professionals who will be your partner in choosing the most responsive mailing lists from this vast universe. As a Reach Marketing client, you receive this service for free.

Types of business mailing lists includes:

**Compiled mailing lists**  
These lists include people or companies assembled from established published sources such as industry listings and general-purpose directories. Compiled lists are excellent for broadcasting your message to large but specific audiences.

**Response mailing lists**  
These lists contain proven direct mail customers who have bought in the past. Mail order offers typically get high rates of return from mailings to response lists consisting of people and companies whose buying history matches your offer.

**Attendee/membership/seminar lists**  
People who have participated in industry conferences, trade shows & other similar special events often have a keen interest in products and services related to their industry sector. Because these shows often incur significant costs to attend, members are heavily invested in their sector; these lists represent an outstanding opportunity for highly targeted marketing.

**Subscription mailing lists**  
These are some of the best and largest lists on the market. Two types of subscription lists exist: controlled circulation and paid circulation. With controlled circulation, the readers receive the magazine free, provided they can prove to the publisher that they fall into a certain professional category. With paid circulation, the reader pays for a subscription and is not required to provide additional data other than name and address.

Controlled circulation lists, on the other hand, allow extensive selectability. Because controlled circulation subscribers have offered significant information, you can choose demographic segments within the list, including separation by job title, job function, size of company or type of products purchased.

## Business Mailing List Selectivity

Selects allow you to pinpoint your audience even further. Additional fees are charged for selections ranging from $5 to $50+.

Popular selects for business mailing lists include:

- Industry/Business Type  
- SIC Code  
- Job Title  
- Job Function  
- Number of Employees  
- Sales Volume  
- One Per Company

**What is a Datacard?**  
A datacard gives information on the mailing list you are interested in renting, such as number of postal addresses available, costs based on price per thousand, and a description of the list. Make sure the datacard includes an update frequency to ensure a clean, up-to-date list.

When choosing a business mailing list, ask for usage information available, which shows what other brands have used the list and what its success has been in terms of results.
