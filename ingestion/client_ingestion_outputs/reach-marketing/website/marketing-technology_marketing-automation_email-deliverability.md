**What’s a Sender Score?**

A Sender Score is a numerical representation of the reputation of an email sender’s IP address, typically ranging from 0 to 100. It is calculated based on various factors such as complaint rates, bounce rates, and spam trap hits. A higher Sender Score indicates a better reputation, leading to improved email deliverability rates and ensuring that emails reach the recipients’ inboxes rather than their spam folders. **Maintaining a high Sender Score is crucial for successful email marketing campaigns.**
