# Six Email Marketing Musts for 2021

After the havoc of 2020, businesses are trying to get back on track. New marketing strategies are being devised – and if your market-savvy, you’ll want to employ the most up-to-date online marketing strategies to get back in the game.

Consumer-business relationships are likely to be at the forefront of the new trends, and there is no better way to relationship-build with your global customer base in a post-pandemic world than via email marketing. Email marketing can quickly boost both your community’s engagement – and ultimately, your company’s revenue – getting you back on track after one of the strangest years on record. Read on to find out how.

## Make People Matter

In email marketing, personalization is key. **Emails with personalized subject lines get higher transaction rates** – six times higher, according to Experian – and according to Campaign Monitor, they’re 26% more likely to be opened than emails with no personalization.

Just adding a name isn’t going to cut it, though – hyper-personalization ensures that emails only supply customers with content that is directly relevant to them – or even feels like it was created specifically for them.

How? You might ask. Segmentation is the key.

The more segments you can create, the more personalized your content will feel. **Divide your list by purchase history, browsing behavior, location, and more**. Then, it’s as simple as creating unique content that is relevant to each group. It’s a bit more work-intensive, but the results will be envious.

## Create Interactions

The only thing better than acting in marketing is interacting. Customers who are given the opportunity to interact with the marketing content you send them will feel ultimately more engaged than ones who simply read, then discard. Some types of interaction included animated buttons and CTAs, product carousels, surveys, polls, and user-generated interactive content.

## Shine Bright

Colors evoke emotions and drive action. Psychologists often relate blue with tranquility, trust and security, while yellow brings about feelings of joy and happiness, for example. In US marketing trends, black often represents luxury or power.

Using vibrant, relevant colors in your marketing emails drives engagement while simultaneously increasing your brand awareness and even your click-through rates.

## Engage, Then Re-engage

Email engagement is incomplete without a re-engagement campaign to back it up. Re-engagement campaigns remind your customers about **abandoned shopping carts,** send exclusive discounts, or highlight related products to ones they almost or have already purchased. Usage trends show that customers often get distracted during the purchase process, and a simple email nudge is enough to get them back to their cart to complete that all-important sale.

## Transact Better

A transaction email is a confirmation message sent to customers who took some sort of action on your website. These all-important emails have an open rate that’s eight times higher than any other marketing email – so instead of letting them slide by unnoticed, you should be using them to increase engagement, sell, and upsell.

## Automate it

All of this personalization is undeniably labor-intensive. This is why perhaps the most important email marketing trend of 2021 is one that many savvy companies have already begun implementing – Automation. The more of your process that is automated, the less time it will take up, and thus, the less it will detract from your marketing budget.

There may still be setbacks and hiccups as the pandemic pans out, but keeping strong relationships with your global consumer base with a strong email marketing game will undoubtedly be key to this year’s growth – and with so many new ideas of how to make it happen, it’s the perfect time to make 2021 your company’s record year.
