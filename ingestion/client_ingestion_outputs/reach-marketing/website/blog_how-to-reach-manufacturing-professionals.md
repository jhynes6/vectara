# How to Reach Manufacturing Professionals

Recently, a study by Gardner Publishing was conducted to determine how manufacturing specialists consume media. They concluded that the majority of these professionals subscribe to manufacturing magazines. Who would have thought? These executives are always on the move and do not always have the time to sift through the Internet to find the answers to their questions. Rather, they trust trade magazines that always guide them in the right direction.

In this circumstance and, probably only a few others nowadays, flipping through a magazine is preferred to navigating a search engine. Magazines 1, Internet 0! Manufacturers cannot afford to receive their information from a source that isn’t credible. However, shortcuts, workarounds, and helpful tips can never be turned down.

Alright, question time. Did you know that manufacturing is now a growth industry? I know, interesting. For the first time since the 1990s, American manufacturers are creating new jobs, which is good for companies up and down the supply chain interested in increasing their sales of products and services. No one delivers more qualified, BPA audited, and responsive decision-makers in the manufacturing market better than Putman Media. You can access top corporate managers, engineers, plant operations managers, research and development managers, purchasing managers, sales & marketing professionals, and other key business decision-makers in all areas of manufacturing.

Let’s get down to it. You don’t want to waste your time, energy, or resources marketing your company to disinterested professionals. Quality magazine subscriber mailing lists eliminate this doubt and deliver the highest response rates. A perfect example of qualified direct request subscribers published by Putman Media include: _Chemical Processing_, _Control_, _Control Design_, _Food Processing_, _Pharmaceutical Manufacturing_, and _Plant Services_; and their online information resource and community dedicated to advancing the sustainability of manufacturing and other industrial operations, _Sustainable Plant_. Each of these publications focuses on a specific area in the manufacturing industry. You can now eliminate doubt and waste from your marketing budget because these executives are seeking state-of-the-art products and services to help them grow their companies.

Reality is that you are probably not the only one marketing your products and services to these manufacturing professionals. (I’m just being honest here…) Find a way to set yourself apart from the competition. Stand out. The unexpected is the new expected.
