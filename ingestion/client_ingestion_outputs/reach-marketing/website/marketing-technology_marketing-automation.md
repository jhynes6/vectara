### What does platform agnostic mean?

When someone says they are “platform agnostic,” it typically means they are impartial or neutral toward choosing between different technology platforms. In a business context, this can mean that a company or individual doesn’t favor one operating system, software, hardware, or technology over another. Instead, they focus on functionality and performance, choosing the best tools or platforms based on the specific needs of a project or objective, rather than being limited by allegiance to any particular technology. This approach enables flexibility and adaptability in solving technological challenges.

They can also offer training to your team and ensure the system is tailored to your specific business needs.

### What qualifications should I look for in a marketing automation consultant?

Look for qualities such as a deep understanding of marketing automation tools and technologies, proven experience in implementing successful campaigns, strong problem-solving skills, and the ability to tailor strategies to your specific business needs. Additionally, effective communication, a collaborative approach, and a track record of delivering measurable results are essential.
