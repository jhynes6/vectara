# Reach Key IT and Healthcare Management Professionals

Information technology has transformed the healthcare industry, giving medical professionals a wealth of information. From improving care at the level of individual patients to big-data applications that give researchers deep insight into whole communities, data now plays a critical role. The Health Data Management Magazine Subscribers Business Mailing List from SourceMedia and managed by Reach Marketing puts you in touch with healthcare professionals who are plugged into the latest information technology solutions.

Featuring nearly 150,000 postal addresses, more than 126,000 phone numbers, and 74,500 email addresses, this business mailing list includes decision-makers in a range of healthcare roles. Hospital and clinic administrators, boards of directors, senior hospital executives, general administration, clinicians, group practice administrators, health insurance providers, managed care providers, physicians, home care professionals, pharmacists, and more are a part of the Health Data Management Magazine Subscribers Business Mailing List.
