Typical Obstacles Today For
Successful Lead Generation

▪ Sky Rocketing Pricing – Prices of leads have

increased steadily, making them cost prohibitive in
many cases ranging from $40-70 per lead.

▪ Lack of Targeting – Many lead providers provide

leads that can’t pinpoint the audience resulting in
leads that are too general.

▪ Minimal Data Depth – Most leads contain minimal

contact data, and lack any firmographic data needed
for personalization and persona building.

▪ Data Accuracy – Most leads typically have at least
one inaccurate data point which many times are
critical to your success.

▪ Restrictive Minimums – Many lead providers require

large minimums with long term contract
requirements.

More than 40% of
marketers view the lack of
resources as the biggest
obstacle to lead generation.

33% of data is inaccurate.
You’re losing 33% of your
opportunities to gather leads or
convert opportunities to revenue.

Only 42% of marketers know
the basic demographic information
of their target audience, like their
name, gender, and location.
