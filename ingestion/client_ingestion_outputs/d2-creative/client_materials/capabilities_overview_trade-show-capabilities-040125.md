## Utilize Current Video Assets for In-depth Interactive Exhibits

Mizuho OSI has a wealth of video content across its lines of surgical tables and accessories. We recommend taking advantage of these existing assets and add to them where necessary to create a “virtual” showroom that can help detail the current (and potentially promote upcoming) product lines.

Videos currently exist for
ProAxis® Spinal Surgery Table
Trios® Surgical Table System
Levó™™ Head Positioning System
Comparisons
Modules
Additional content can be created to fill gaps or highlight specific features
A kiosk can be designed to serve up the video content along with other more detailed information including challenging cases, product details and specifications
Kiosks can drive large video screens that serve as booth attractors
