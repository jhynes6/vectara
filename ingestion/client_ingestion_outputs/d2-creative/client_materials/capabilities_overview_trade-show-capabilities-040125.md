Virtual Showroom
Utilize Current Video Assets for In-depth Interactive Exhibits
Mizuho OSI has a wealth of video content across its lines of surgical tables and accessories. We
recommend taking advantage of these existing assets and add to them where necessary to create a
“virtual” showroom that can help detail the current (and potentially promote upcoming) product lines.

• Videos currently exist for

• ProAxis® Spinal Surgery Table
• Trios® Surgical Table System
• Levó  Head Positioning System

• Comparisons
• Modules

• Additional content can be created to fill gaps or highlight specific features

• A kiosk can be designed to serve up the video content along with other more detailed information including

challenging cases, product details and specifications

• Kiosks can drive large video screens that serve as booth attractors
