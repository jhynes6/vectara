Cost of Services

What is your average order value? What are your “Starting At” costs for your services?
 Flexibility of engagement, test drive us
 We have offered initial engagements at a variety of price points in order to win new customers. Consulting engagements (excluding designed/built deliverables like content, websites, videos, print materials, etc.) can be offered as low as $10K.
 In the past 18 months most first-time engagements were in the $40 - $50K range. In these cases we were delivering both strategic and tactical services
 Fixed fee, no retainer option needed always 

Service Differentiation

What makes you different from your competitors? What is your “special sauce”?
 It’s nothing proprietary. Aside from having a depth of experience in the life sciences space (usually a prerequisite in order to win work) we have deep knowledge and understanding of the digital landscape. We also don’t swap teams once a project is awarded, i.e., there’s no “B” team. The core team you meet is the team that you work with. Finally, we generally have long client relationships (some 10+ years) and very little turn over internally.
 No B-Team, you are always getting the best. Paying for the senior level thinking

Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? What do you do to improve their business?
 Our clients typically have two primary problems/challenges.
 They do not have the resources/experience to mount comprehensive campaigns internally that they are being asked to execute
 They are challenged in meeting sales goals relying only on traditional (sales reps/tradeshows) marketing/selling practices and are looking for new ways to grow awareness of their products/services in a highly competitive and REGULATED environment

Case Studies and Previous Customer Successes

For each service, what are case studies or recent customer successes that you use to highlight your expertise in your field?
 Case studies and thought leadership materials provided under separate cover.
