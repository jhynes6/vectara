#### Tips for Programmatic Ads

*   **Understand everything you can about your audience**
The targeting options in programmatic ad platforms will only go as deep as you can make them. The more research you put into understanding the demographics and behavior of your audience, the more easily you’ll be able to focus on the users that matter most.
*   **Don’t neglect platform differences**
Just because you can blast one set of ads across every channel, that doesn’t mean you should. Each of the formats available through programmatic advertising has its own best practices, and ignoring them is a surefire way to lower the impact of your advertising.
*   **Take advantage of the on-demand scalability**
Don’t just set it and forget it! Programmatic platforms come with dashboards that let you closely monitor the performance of ads to determine what’s working the best and identify opportunities to fine-tune your strategy or budget.
