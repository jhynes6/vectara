# Programmatic Advertising

## Put Your Ad Spend Where Your Customers Are

### What is Programmatic Advertising?

Programmatic advertising refers to using third-party platforms or software to automate the digital ad buying process. By simplifying this part of the execution process, companies can more efficiently deploy campaigns across varied platforms.

This advertising strategy is generally used by companies looking to maximize their brand awareness among specific audiences, as its data-driven behavioral targeting helps marketers hone in on important channels and strategies for their audiences.

#### Why Go Programmatic?

*   **Scalable**  
    The programmatic approach lets you craft campaigns to your specific goals and budget, then easily adjust and optimize them in real time based on performance.
*   **Precise**  
    Programmatic ad platforms allow you to reach your exact audience by targeting users’ behavior, geographic location, and even what context they see your ads in.
*   **Multi-Channel Reach**  
    Campaigns can be run across a huge variety of digital platforms simultaneously to ensure your messaging appears where your audience will see it.
*   **Cost-effective**  
    The improved placement and targeting options of programmatic advertising help you lower costs and improve ROI by filtering out paying for only high-value impressions.

#### Tips for Programmatic Ads

*   **Understand everything you can about your audience**  
    The targeting options in programmatic ad platforms will only go as deep as you can make them. The more research you put into understanding the demographics and behavior of your audience, the more easily you’ll be able to focus on the users that matter most.
*   **Don’t neglect platform differences**  
    Just because you can blast one set of ads across every channel, that doesn’t mean you should. Each of the formats available through programmatic advertising has its own best practices, and ignoring them is a surefire way to lower the impact of your advertising.
*   **Take advantage of the on-demand scalability**  
    Don’t just set it and forget it! Programmatic platforms come with dashboards that let you closely monitor the performance of ads to determine what’s working the best and identify opportunities to fine-tune your strategy or budget.
