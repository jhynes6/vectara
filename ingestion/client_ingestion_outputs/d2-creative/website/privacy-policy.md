Whenever you send an email via our site, you will be providing us with your name, title, email address, phone number and any information you choose to include, such as an RFP opportunity, in the text of your message. For example, you may choose to provide your mailing address or other information necessary or helpful for us to address your query or other concern.

### Technical and Other Information

*   **All Site Users** – this site uses commonly-used automated information gathering tools. While you are browsing our site, we may automatically log your IP address (a number assigned to your computer when you use the Internet), general data (including your domain name, and the name of the web page from which you entered our site, and your activity while using our site.

## Use of Cookies, Tracking Pixels and Social Media Plug-ins

*   **Use of Cookies** – Various web tools (analysis programs and social media services) have been integrated into the Website that use “Cookies” or similar technologies. Cookies are text files that are sent by a web server to the user’s browser in order to store information on the user’s devices via the browser that is being used, for example the user’s current IP address and information about the user. The next time the web server is accessed, the applicable information regarding the user is transmitted from the Cookie file.

On this Website, we have engaged some service providers to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information from you. Such service providers may set cookies on behalf of us. We also use other third-party cookies to track the effectiveness of the Website and to advertise our services. Some of the web tools that track you include Google Analytics, Google Ads (i.e., DoubleClick), and LinkedIn.

*   **Social Network Plug-ins** – On the Website, plug-ins for the social networks (“network”) have been or may be integrated. When you access the Website, these plug-ins can potentially create a direct connection between your browser and the server of the respective network. The content of the plug-in will be directly transmitted from the network to your browser, which will integrate it into the Website. We have no control regarding the scope of the data which is collected with the aid of the plug-in. The integrated plug-in informs the network that the user has accessed our website and informs the network of the user’s IP address. If the user is logged in to the network of this plug-in at that point in time, the network will be able to link the visit with the user’s account.

If you are a member of the respective network and do not want it to collect information about you via the Website and to link this information with the data that the network has already stored about you, then please close the Website, log out from your user account for the respective network and afterwards visit the Website once again.

If you are not a member of the network or you have logged from the network before visiting the Website, the possibility still exists that the network will ascertain (at least) your IP address and store it. Please note that this information is already exchanged when you visit the Website, regardless whether you interact with the plug-ins or not.

*   **Use of Tracking Pixels** – Tracking pixels are small pieces of code used to collect and share information with online advertisers on your usage of our webpages, such as the pages that you have visited, or the way you have interacted with them. Through the tracking pixels, your browser automatically establishes a connection with the server of an online advertiser. In this way, the online advertiser receives the information that you have accessed one of our websites. This allows us to ensure that we are serving ads that match your interests, when you are visiting any of the websites of the online advertiser, or a website that includes ads served by the online advertiser. If you are authenticated to an online advertiser using tracking pixels, e.g. by being registered and logged in to a social network, the online advertiser can assign the visit to one of our websites or the access of our mobile applications to your account. We have no influence on the extent to which the data collected through the tracking pixels is used by the online advertisers and therefore direct you to their privacy notices linked below.
