## Strategy Trumps Volume in the Pursuit of Digital Marketing Success

Algorithms that reward consistency, competitors who seem to post ceaselessly, and anecdotes from other marketers of plummeting engagement after short periods of social media silence have all amped up the pressure on businesses to post as often as possible.

This compulsion is not unfounded—posting frequently can keep you top-of-mind with consumers and earn you some favorability with activity-based algorithms. But without thorough, intentional, data-driven planning, your [content marketing](https://www.d2creative.com/digital-glossary/content-marketing/) will fail to deliver results.

### The Problem with Tactics Without Strategy

When it comes to generating content for social media, it can be difficult to know where to begin. Many businesses look to trends, competitors, and legacy advice as they develop copy and media. The development process itself is time-consuming, and when it is done without guiding insights, it can yield inconsistent messaging, failing to capture appropriate audiences. Unfocused content with random (versus tactical) calls-to-action lacks clear Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). This makes ROI impossible to track, perpetuating a cycle of uninformed, ineffective media creation.

Ultimately, high-volume content creation without strategy wastes valuable resources, from employee time to marketing budgets. Frequent, inefficient posts can even have adverse effects such as diluting [brand messaging](https://www.d2creative.com/digital-glossary/branding-fundamentals/) and creating a perception of spam.

### Why Strategy is Non-Negotiable

Data-driven strategy ensures the most efficient use of your resources while maximizing target outcomes.

In order for a campaign or platform presence to be successful, there must be established, clear metrics for said success. Once measurable goals, KPIs, and target audiences have been identified, research can be done to determine which channels and media types will yield the highest impact.

A strategic content creation plan also involves measurement tools and data tracking, with both providing a framework for readjustments when necessary.
