## [Launch Products with Confidence & Land with Impact](https://www.d2creative.com/launch-products-with-confidence/)

Posted on [July 22, 2025July 22, 2025](https://www.d2creative.com/launch-products-with-confidence/) by [Keith Rasmussen](https://www.d2creative.com/author/krasmussend2creative-com/)

## More budget. More scrutiny. More stakeholders are watching every move.

Product launches today are high-stakes events, with internal and external teams closely tracking every detail, and the difference between success and failure can come down to how well you execute on every front.

### If you’re preparing a product launch or relaunch, here’s what you need to do, and what most teams often miss.

#### Strategic Messaging & Nailing the Narrative

![](https://www.d2creative.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/bullseye-arrow-regular@3x.svg)

Your product might be brilliant, but if your messaging doesn’t connect with the right stakeholders (which could include surgeons, clinicians, procurement teams, executives), then your launch won’t land.

**What many teams miss:**
Aligning messaging with buyer pain points and regulatory realities upfront.

#### Integrated Campaign Planning – Now is Not the Time for the Status Quo

![](https://www.d2creative.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/group-arrows-rotate-regular@3x.svg)

A launch shouldn’t be just one ad group or email. It’s a carefully choreographed mix of tactics that builds momentum and trust.

**What many teams miss:**
Coordinating digital ads, webinars, trade show presence, content marketing, and sales enablement to reinforce each other.

#### Creative Execution & Building Assets That Do More Than Look Good

A sleek sales deck or explainer video means nothing if it doesn’t motivate action.

**What many teams miss:**
Creating content designed to inform and convert.

#### Real-Time Launch Optimizations to Maintain Steam

No campaign stays perfect once it goes live. Ad fatigue can happen sooner than you plan, and the market, competitors, and audiences all shift fast.

**What many teams miss:**
Ongoing performance monitoring and nimble adjustments that keep your launch ahead.

### Launching Something Big? Let's Talk.

Bringing a new product to market in the life sciences industry is no small feat. Success requires strategic storytelling, precise positioning, and seamless execution across channels.

## [Digital Marketing Priorities for MedTech Startups](https://www.d2creative.com/digital-marketing-medtech-startup/)

Posted on [April 12, 2023July 25, 2025](https://www.d2creative.com/digital-marketing-medtech-startup/) by [Scott Holmes](https://www.d2creative.com/author/sholmesd2creative-com/)

[![Digital Marketing Priorities for MedTech Startups](https://www.d2creative.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blog-hero-marketing-priorities@2x1.png)](https://www.d2creative.com/digital-marketing-medtech-startup/)

[The role of digital marketing in MedTech](https://go.d2creative.com/digital-marketing-medtech-white-paper/) has become more prominent in the last few years, and marketing leaders at MedTech startups need to focus on a few key elements in order to attract and retain customers, build awareness, and drive revenue growth.

![](https://www.d2creative.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/brand-marketing-priorities@2x-1-1024x683.jpg)

**Website** – The website is the primary digital asset of the company, and it should be optimized for user experience and lead generation. MedTech leaders should work to ensure that the website is designed to be mobile-friendly, fast-loading, and informative, and features clear calls-to-action throughout.

**Search Engine Optimization (SEO)** – The website must also be optimized for search. It is important for your SEO strategy to involve identifying the most relevant keywords and phrases related to your products and services, and optimizing your website content to rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs). This would include both on-page (such as updating headlines and copy on the page) and off-page optimization techniques (such as improving site performance, adding or updating metadata, etc.).

**Content Marketing** –Brands need to quickly establish themselves as thought leaders. In order to accomplish this, MedTech startups should focus on creating and sharing high-quality, informative content across blogs, social media, and email marketing to engage with potential customers and build brand awareness. The content is generally designed around one of two main goals:

1.  **Promotional content** that informs your target audience about your products and services, their benefits, and the problems they solve.
2.  [Educational content](https://www.d2creative.com/capabilities/content-development/health-education/) that teaches your audience about important health topics that relate to your therapy/or products

**Email Marketing** – Build email campaigns to nurture leads and keep existing customers informed. Newsletters, new content announcements, product updates, new services, and other promotional materials all help keep subscribers engaged.

Overall, the digital marketing strategy for MedTech startups should prioritize creating valuable content, engaging with potential customers across various digital channels, and measuring and optimizing your efforts to achieve your business objectives.

## [Top Trends in the Medical Device and Life Science Marketing Industry to Leverage in 2022](https://www.d2creative.com/medical-device-life-science-trends-2022/)

Posted on [March 27, 2022November 14, 2024](https://www.d2creative.com/medical-device-life-science-trends-2022/) by [Scott Holmes](https://www.d2creative.com/author/sholmesd2creative-com/)

[![Top Trends in the Medical Device and Life Science Marketing Industry to Leverage in 2022](https://www.d2creative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/blog-hero-top-trends@2x-scaled.jpg)](https://www.d2creative.com/medical-device-life-science-trends-2022/)

## This Year, Consider These Medical Device Industry Trends

D2 Creative has compiled the top trends we believe companies should consider throughout the remainder of 2022.

## Trend: Wearable Technology Devices

![Two fingers pressing the Apple watch home button showing the home screen.](https://www.d2creative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/apple-watch@2x-1024x683.png)

Now more than ever, consumers are wearing medical devices like watches and wristbands – namely, Apple Watch, Samsung, Fitbit, etc. Users get the benefits of tracking their heart rates (sometimes even blood pressure, depending on what apps they download) and blood oxygen levels, as well as measuring activity levels and calorie expenditure through exercise output. Consumers can keep track of health records over time and quickly send out emergency calls/alerts if in a dire health situation.

The normalization of wearable devices has made consumers more comfortable using medical devices at home. However, companies need to create the right educational content to ensure all providers and their patients are able to utilize the technology correctly. Read a case study included in our [whitepaper](https://go.d2creative.com/medical-devices-industry-report/).

## Trend: Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality

Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) can serve many functions in the medical device and life sciences industry. For example, VR and AR can help physicians and surgeons practice their medical care in real-time. They can plug into an environment to practice certain skills or use virtual calculators to see the cost-benefit analysis of implementing new technologies.

Companies that already leverage VR and AR experiences can market and promote themselves by highlighting the benefits of this trend in social media posts, specifically patient and physician case studies, as well as videos demonstrating the use of this technology in their practice. [Download the whitepaper for a case study](https://go.d2creative.com/medical-devices-industry-report/), as well as other industry trends and stats.

## Trend: Remote Meetings

We saw the sharp rise of telemedicine during the pandemic, and patients are more open to this experience in their healthcare. Similarly, [HCPs expect at least some of their meetings with sales professionals to continue virtually](https://go.d2creative.com/medical-devices-industry-report/). There’s still room for medical device and life science companies to optimize how they leverage platforms and applications to conduct calls. This can include the use of video and call meeting software, as well as organizational platforms that keep track of patient and vendor appointments and keeps data secure.

## Trend: Increased Digital Engagement

Even as the world reopens, medical device organizations must continue to embrace digital marketing and sales channels. 84% of surveyed healthcare providers found a new sales model that incorporates online self-service and virtual interactions to be as, if not more, effective than the pre-pandemic model (Accenture, 2021). [Digital marketing services](https://d2creative.com/capabilities/) from an agency that specializes in medical device and life science organizations can get companies in touch with other businesses and consumers that want their products and services.
