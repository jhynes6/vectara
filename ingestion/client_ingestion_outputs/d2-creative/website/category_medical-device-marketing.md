## Launch Products with Confidence & Land with Impact

Posted on July 22, 2025 by Keith Rasmussen

## More budget. More scrutiny. More stakeholders are watching every move.

Product launches today are high-stakes events, with internal and external teams closely tracking every detail, and the difference between success and failure can come down to how well you execute on every front.

### If you’re preparing a product launch or relaunch, here’s what you need to do, and what most teams often miss.

#### Strategic Messaging & Nailing the Narrative

Your product might be brilliant, but if your messaging doesn’t connect with the right stakeholders (which could include surgeons, clinicians, procurement teams, executives), then your launch won’t land.

**What many teams miss:**  Aligning messaging with buyer pain points and regulatory realities upfront.

#### Integrated Campaign Planning – Now is Not the Time for the Status Quo

A launch shouldn’t be just one ad group or email. It’s a carefully choreographed mix of tactics that builds momentum and trust.

**What many teams miss:**  Coordinating digital ads, webinars, trade show presence, content marketing, and sales enablement to reinforce each other.

#### Creative Execution & Building Assets That Do More Than Look Good

A sleek sales deck or explainer video means nothing if it doesn’t motivate action.

**What many teams miss:**  Creating content designed to inform and convert.

#### Real-Time Launch Optimizations to Maintain Steam

No campaign stays perfect once it goes live. Ad fatigue can happen sooner than you plan, and the market, competitors, and audiences all shift fast.

**What many teams miss:**  Ongoing performance monitoring and nimble adjustments that keep your launch ahead.

### Launching Something Big? Let's Talk.

## Digital Marketing Priorities for MedTech Startups

Posted on April 12, 2023 by Scott Holmes

The role of digital marketing in MedTech has become more prominent in the last few years, and marketing leaders at MedTech startups need to focus on a few key elements in order to attract and retain customers, build awareness, and drive revenue growth.

**Branding** – Branding is extremely important for a MedTech startup, as it plays a critical role in shaping how the company is perceived by its target audience, investors, and stakeholders. A strong brand can differentiate the company from competitors, build trust with customers, and establish a unique identity in the marketplace.

**Website** – The website is the primary digital asset of the company, and it should be optimized for user experience and lead generation. MedTech leaders should work to ensure that the website is designed to be mobile-friendly, fast-loading, and informative, and features clear calls-to-action throughout.

**Search Engine Optimization (SEO)** – The website must also be optimized for search. It is important for your SEO strategy to involve identifying the most relevant keywords and phrases related to your products and services, and optimizing your website content to rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs). This would include both on-page (such as updating headlines and copy on the page) and off-page optimization techniques (such as improving site performance, adding or updating metadata, etc.).

**Content Marketing** – Brands need to quickly establish themselves as thought leaders. In order to accomplish this, MedTech startups should focus on creating and sharing high-quality, informative content across blogs, social media, and email marketing to engage with potential customers and build brand awareness. The content is generally designed around one of two main goals:

1.  **Promotional content** that informs your target audience about your products and services, their benefits, and the problems they solve.
2.  **Educational content** that teaches your audience about important health topics that relate to your therapy/or products.

**Social Media Marketing** – Use social media platforms like LinkedIn to build a community of followers, share content, and engage with potential customers. Lean heavily into organic strategies and tactics when all you have is time and talent, developing a strategy to create a healthy mix of regularly published content. Leverage paid ads to grow even faster, with tactics like follower ads or boosting high-priority content to get it in front of people who don’t follow you yet but should.

**Email Marketing** – Build email campaigns to nurture leads and keep existing customers informed. Newsletters, new content announcements, product updates, new services, and other promotional materials all help keep subscribers engaged.

**Web Analytics** – Leverage various tools and platforms to measure the effectiveness of your digital campaigns, so that you know what’s working and what needs improvement. Based on insights gained from the data analysis, you can make adjustments to your campaigns, website, social media content, and other digital tactics to optimize performance.

Overall, the digital marketing strategy for MedTech startups should prioritize creating valuable content, engaging with potential customers across various digital channels, and measuring and optimizing your efforts to achieve your business objectives.
