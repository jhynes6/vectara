### What is Display Advertising?

“Display advertising” refers to online advertising that uses visual elements (static or animated images, video) to promote a brand across online platforms (social media, websites, mobile apps).

### Rich Media Ads

Interactive ads with elements like hover effects or expandable sections

The advertiser pays for their ads either by the click ([pay-per-click](https://d2creative.com/digital-glossary/pay-per-click-advertising/) ads), or by the number of “impressions” / views their ads receive (a payment model inherited from traditional print and television advertising).

*   Display ad networks use a real-time bidding (RTB) system for their pricing. RTB prices go up and down based on complex algorithms. For the most part, these prices are based on supply and demand (which includes factors such as the host site’s viewership and the amount of competition there is for your type of ad), but there are other factors.
*   When an ad buyer makes a direct buy, the payment is a fixed-fee over a given time period.
*   The fastest growing segment of display advertising is on mobile devices.

#### Strengths & Weaknesses

Display ads have had a poor reputation since they were introduced. Clickthrough rates are typically low. Studies have shown that many people find them irrelevant amidst their internet usage and often do not read them. Even so, many organizations use them for brand and product awareness. While consumers frequently say they’re immune to advertising, most of us pay more attention than we’d like to admit—try asking a non-beer drinker how many brands of beer they can think of! Our customers have been very satisfied with the brand-visibility and identity-awareness results of their traditional display ad campaigns, as clickthrough rates do not reflect improvements in recognition.

Moreover, display advertising is becoming a more viable option for advertisers looking for measurable ROI. This is because it’s now possible to serve up more contextual, targeted, relevant ads that are subsequently better-received by viewers. Ad exchanges and real-time bidding allows advertisers to bid on only the ad space that’s relevant to them, based on how they want to target their audience. Advertising techniques like native advertising and various types of audience [retargeting](https://d2creative.com/digital-glossary/retargeting/) are proving to be much more effective than traditional banner ads.

#### Tips for Success

To make your display ad campaigns more successful:

*   Clearly define the campaign goals and set benchmarks
*   Select ad formats (sizes) with the best performance history
*   Use custom campaign landing pages
*   Track performance and be willing to change or modify the campaign creative, copy, or budgets based on your results

### Impressions

The number of times your ad is displayed on a website or app. High impressions indicate brand visibility, but they don’t guarantee engagement.

### CTR

**(Click-Through-Rate)**

**Formula: (Clicks / Impressions) × 100**. The percentage of people who click on a piece of content after seeing it. A higher CTR suggests that the ad is relevant and engaging.

### CPC

**(Cost-Per-Click)** **Formula: Total Ad Spend / Total Clicks**. The amount you pay for each click on your ad. Lower CPC means you’re getting more engagement at a lower cost.
