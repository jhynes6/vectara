# Transforming the Complex Into Better Health Education

### Why Most Patient Education Fails – And How to Fix It

For patients facing a medical condition, the right information can mean the difference between confidence and confusion—and even life or death. But here’s the problem: most patient education isn’t working.

Patients struggle to comprehend and retain complex medical details; especially when dealing with the emotional weight of a diagnosis. Instead of clear explanations, they receive dense pamphlets filled with jargon. Overwhelmed, many turn to the internet, where misinformation spreads faster than facts.

**What’s the secret to patient education that actually works?** Studies reveal one approach that dramatically improves understanding and retention. Yet it’s overlooked when producing patient educational content. Are you making the same mistake?

### Luminations: Because Better Education Leads to Better Health

Health education doesn’t have to be complicated or scary.

**Luminations is an innovative approach to patient educational content** based on scientific learning principles that help translate your most challenging concepts into memorable and enlightening experiences.

Luminations content empowers patients by teaching them about their disease and treatment options in ways designed to improve health literacy through engagement, interaction, comprehension, and retention.

Achieve your goals of improving adherence, increasing clinical trial enrollment, and/or driving better outcomes.

**Luminations content makes complex medical information engaging, actionable, and easy to understand.**

*   **Meet Patients Where They Are.** Accessible content that patients of all health literacy levels can watch, share, and trust.
*   **Align with Expert Recommendations.** Luminations content supports patient engagement and retention strategies recommended by the WHO, NIH, the Society for Public Health Education (SOPHE), and more.

*   **Education Over Promotion.** Luminations content is clear, unbranded health education that empowers informed decisions.
*   **Powered by Storytelling.** We turn complex topics into engaging, experience-driven narratives that stick.

Seek medical information from real medical experts, not questionable online sources

### “_Healthcare must base its messages on the theories and principles of health education (e.g., what the message says), health communication (e.g., how the message is delivered), and the health literacy of the intended audience (e.g., whether the message is accessed and understood)._”1
— WHO

### What is Luminations?

**The Luminations approach** combines a straightforward, translation-friendly narrative with visuals and storytelling that deliver “Aha!” moments where everything just clicks. We do this through **memorable videos**, **engaging interactive media**, **Ask the Expert Video FAQs and cleverly imagined infographics**.

Watch how our Luminations approach simplifies complex, health-related concepts with engaging, easy-to-understand content that resonates.

### “_Content that truly resonates with patients, such as animated educational videos, is effective at increasing both knowledge and comfort._”2
