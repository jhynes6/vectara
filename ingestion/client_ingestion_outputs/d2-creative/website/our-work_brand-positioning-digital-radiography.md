Fujifilm performed an extensive customer research study that provided new insights into brand awareness and customer satisfaction. The results told them that customers valued the reliability of their equipment as well as their quality service and support. Our task was to incorporate these results into a revitalized brand positioning campaign for digital radiography products.

We developed a customer-focused campaign that challenged the perception that “all providers are alike.” The “Bring It” campaign defines Fujifilm as a bold, strong, confident organization that can take on any challenge, and positions their customers to do the same.

The campaign was incorporated into Fujifilm’s Digital Radiography website and a series of print ads. The multi-touchpoint campaign emphasized the reliability of Fujifilm equipment and the company’s commitment to go the extra distance to maintain the service that customers expect.

We created a campaign that allowed this “challenger brand” to gain awareness and trust within the marketplace. The end result was the successful repositioning of a product to instill confidence, both within consumer interactions and throughout the organization itself. Through the “Bring It” campaign, we emphasized a message upon which Fujifilm is built: providing the best performance while offering true value to its customers.
