### Brand Discovery: What To Expect

We really can’t tell you how other companies “do branding” because, frankly, there’s a lot of variation. We can tell you what we do.

Every organization needs to go through branding at some point, and usually more than once. Effective branding means that your key, “big picture” thinkers need to get in one room and get their thoughts out on the table. That’s why we’ve created a streamlined branding process that we use with our clients for organizational-and product-level branding, rebranding, and “brand refreshing.” Usually it only takes one half-day, in-person meeting with all the stakeholders to complete our branding process. We’d like everyone’s input throughout the review process, but we know it’s hard to get everyone in the room together more than once, and we work with that.

Are we revealing the recipe to the secret sauce? Not really. We think ours comes from our expertise and our ability to listen and come up with results that resonate with you and your audience.
