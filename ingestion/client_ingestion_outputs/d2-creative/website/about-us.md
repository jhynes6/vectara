## We’re a Different Kind of Marketing Agency

How does being an **independent, full-service marketing agency** make D2 different? It’s simple really: We only answer to YOU, not some holding company or their shareholders. We are a [minority-and woman-owned small business](https://appliedinfopartners.com/about/) that combines a broad understanding of strategy, creativity, and technology to help our clients achieve success. We offer a range of services that help brands effectively grow their digital presence and promote themselves. Our clients like that. For over 20 years we’ve built strong relationships with non-profits as well as companies in the life sciences, medical device, and technology industries, among others. They trust us to always bring our “A” team to engagements and do all the work in-house, from [branding](/capabilities/brand-and-messaging-development/), [website design & app development](/capabilities/website-design-and-app-development/), [video production](/capabilities/video-production-and-digital-storytelling/), digital marketing, AR/XR experiences, and so much more.
