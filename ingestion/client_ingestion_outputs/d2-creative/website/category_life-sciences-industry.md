## Launch Products with Confidence & Land with Impact

Posted on July 22, 2025 by Keith Rasmussen

## More budget. More scrutiny. More stakeholders are watching every move.

Product launches today are high-stakes events, with internal and external teams closely tracking every detail, and the difference between success and failure can come down to how well you execute on every front.

### If you’re preparing a product launch or relaunch, here’s what you need to do, and what most teams often miss.

#### Strategic Messaging & Nailing the Narrative

Your product might be brilliant, but if your messaging doesn’t connect with the right stakeholders (which could include surgeons, clinicians, procurement teams, executives), then your launch won’t land.

**What many teams miss:**  
Aligning messaging with buyer pain points and regulatory realities upfront.

#### Integrated Campaign Planning – Now is Not the Time for the Status Quo

A launch shouldn’t be just one ad group or email. It’s a carefully choreographed mix of tactics that builds momentum and trust.

**What many teams miss:**  
Coordinating digital ads, webinars, trade show presence, content marketing, and sales enablement to reinforce each other.

#### Creative Execution & Building Assets That Do More Than Look Good

A sleek sales deck or explainer video means nothing if it doesn’t motivate action.

**What many teams miss:**  
Creating content designed to inform and convert.

#### Real-Time Launch Optimizations to Maintain Steam

No campaign stays perfect once it goes live. Ad fatigue can happen sooner than you plan, and the market, competitors, and audiences all shift fast.

**What many teams miss:**  
Ongoing performance monitoring and nimble adjustments that keep your launch ahead.

### Launching Something Big? Let's Talk.

Bringing a new product to market in the life sciences industry is no small feat. Success requires strategic storytelling, precise positioning, and seamless execution across channels.

That’s where D2 Creative comes in. We help life science companies plan, launch, and scale new products with campaigns that build momentum and drive results from day one.

## How to Create Clear, Engaging Patient Education Content (That's Not Just Another PDF)

You’re on the front lines of patient advocacy, education, and engagement and believe in empowering patients with the knowledge they need to take control of their health, but you face a tough reality:

* Patients tune out because materials are dense, dry, or filled with jargon.
* Navigating compliance and legal restrictions limits creative freedom in patient education.
* Internal buy-in is hard to get, and you’re constantly fighting for budget and resources.
* Health education competes with marketing noise and online content, yet lacks the creative edge to stand out.

**You _know_ patient education can be better. But how do you make it happen without hitting roadblocks, or wasting budget on materials that don’t work?**

## Ineffective Patient Education Wastes Time and Money

Most patient educational content these days is a collection of text-heavy PDFs or static web pages that get little engagement. These solutions are inexpensive to produce, but often fail to drive real patient understanding, leading to more questions, confusion, and non-adherence. Investing in high-quality patient education is a strategic move that, ultimately, saves more time, resources, and can help drive better patient outcomes.

## Taking a More Creative Approach

The most effective way to approach creating educational content for patients is by doing it in a way that blends creativity, science, and compliance. This way you’re creating materials that are:

* **Designed for engagement** – Use animation, engaging visuals, and compelling storytelling to simplify complex topics and hold attention.
* **Educational, not promotional** – Focus your content on empowering patients, not selling to them.
* **Scientifically sound, not oversimplified** – Translating complex concepts without dumbing them down helps user comprehension without feeling condescension.
* **Compliant but not boring** – It’s important to keep regulatory constraints in mind, but that shouldn’t stop you from using metaphors or a touch of humor to help with explanations.
* **Backed by expertise** – Don’t create content in a vacuum: collaborate with medical professionals, patient advocacy groups, and industry experts to ensure accuracy and relevance.

## The Future of Patient Education Starts with You

With the right approach, you become the champion for meaningful, effective patient education.

Here’s a how the process of pivoting your patient education strategy:

**Step 1: Define and Align.** Start by clarifying your goals, your audience, and the topics that matter most. This sets the foundation for creating content that resonates.

**Step 2: Create and Validate.** From there, creative takes shape, bringing complex ideas to life in a way that’s clear, engaging, and medically sound. Establish ongoing input from patient advocates, which helps ensure accuracy and accessibility throughout.

**Step 3: Deliver and Amplify.** Finally, a smart distribution strategy helps your content reach the people who need it, where and when it matters most.

If you’re exploring ways to elevate your patient education efforts, we’re happy to take a look at what you’re working on and offer some ideas.

## D2 Creative and Veeva Systems Partnership Q&A

President of D2 Creative, Mike DeFabrizio, discusses the thriving partnership between D2 Creative and Veeva Systems, and what it means for D2 clients.

## What is D2’s relationship with Veeva Systems?

Veeva is a leading provider of software solutions for the global life sciences industry, and our agency specializes in development, marketing, and communications in life sciences as well as the medical devices and technology industries. Many of our clients use Veeva, and have looked to us to make a great solution work even better for their sales teams.

D2 and Veeva have been working together for a number of years. We are a technology and multi-channel content partner with Veeva, and in 2021 our integration with CRM/CLM was certified by Veeva. Through the content partnership program, D2’s staff holds business and technical certifications in CLM, Approved Email, Engage Meeting, and Engage for Portals. As part of our technology partnership, members of D2’s development team obtained white belt certification in both CRM and Vault.

## What is Dynamic CLM Integration?

Our team had a specific pain point to solve: How can life sciences companies smoothly integrate outside data into Veeva? We created the Dynamic CLM Integration, a Veeva-certified technology solution, to push this external data into Veeva, making it available for use in presentations or to better inform reporting.

## Why Does Certification Matter?

Being a Silver Certified Technology Partner means that we’ve met stringent criteria to provide a proven, validated, and certified integration with Veeva. Silver Certified Partners must have Veeva-trained employees, reference-able customers, and continuously work with Veeva’s product team to maintain their certified integration.

## What’s Next for D2 and Veeva?

On top of our Dynamic CLM Integration, D2 Creative offers our clients multi-channel content partner services, enhanced Approved Email, content creation and publishing management, and custom development within Veeva. This is in addition to our standard digital agency offerings which include in-house brand building, digital marketing, video production, and other marketing support. There are plenty of opportunities for our current clients who use Veeva, as well as new clients, to take Veeva to the next level.
