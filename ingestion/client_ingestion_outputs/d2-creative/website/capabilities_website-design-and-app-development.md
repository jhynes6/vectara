# Website/App Design & Development

## Best-Practice Web Design

Website design, done right, begins with thinking about your audience, their objectives, and how you can help them find the information they need quickly. Site users need to be able to easily and efficiently complete tasks, whether they use a mobile phone, a tablet, or a laptop.

## A Focus on Your Users

We develop the UI through iteration—rapidly designing and testing prototypes, collecting feedback, and intelligently modifying our layouts. This approach marries both customer and marketer needs, ensuring a user-first design that gives you the data you need to make informed decisions.

This agile methodology is facilitated through the development of fully functional HTML wireframe prototypes. This allows us to test and validate page layouts before graphic design and coding begins. The result is:

*   Reduced design time
*   A decrease in project delays
*   Remaining on budget

## Custom Application Development

Finding a technology partner with the expertise to develop on a variety of platforms can be a challenge. Most firms specialize in one technology or another. We’ve made it a priority to support custom applications development using a variety of the leading enterprise technologies, or if need be we can customize your off-the-shelf or open source solution.

Our developers can deliver solutions using:

*   Software development technologies including Microsoft ASP.NET, .NET Core, Java EE, PHP, Node.js, Apple iOS, and Android
*   Front-end development expertise including responsive sites and technical optimization for search
*   JavaScript libraries/frameworks including Vue.js & ReactJS
*   Content management systems including **WordPress**, **Drupal**, **Joomla!**, and **Umbraco**
*   Databases including Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and MySQL
*   Integrations with third-party platforms/services including Salesforce, Mailchimp/Mandrill, Wistia, Vimeo, Bitly, Cvent, SCORM Cloud, bucketAV, and single-sign-on solutions such as Ping Federate
*   Cloud-based solutions such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and Rackspace
*   TeamCity, Jenkins, and Maven for build management and continuous integration
*   Selenium, with frameworks like TestNG and Cucumber for automated testing
*   Single Page Applications (SPA) and Progressive Web Apps (PWA)
*   Silver Certified Veeva Technology Partner

## Mobile Users Are a Priority

You’ve heard the mantra “**mobile-first**.” It requires you to think carefully about how users perform tasks using only the small amount of screen space available to them. Do your customers come to your site to register for events? Are they looking at pictures or just there for research? These tasks are often very different on a phone, compared to a laptop or desktop. For example, phone users are quite willing to scroll. This is a big change from the days when we lived in fear of placing important content “below the fold”. At D2 Creative, we design to ensure that every user has a great experience regardless of the device they use.

## Website Development Approach

Websites are an essential tool for virtually every organization, but they aren’t all created equal. Both customers and search engines, like Google, prefer sites that are fast-loading, easy-to-use, and optimized to work on their device of choice.

At D2 Creative, the foundation of our web development approach is to use best practices and proven technology platforms to address these needs. From basic template development to completely custom sites, our development team has the skill and experience to build the tools you need to conduct business online.

## App Development for iOS and Android

A website will fit your customers’ needs most of the time, but sometimes highly specialized tools work best as native mobile apps. For example, if your customers need a business tool that works even when they can’t get a reliable cell data connection.

We can help you take your idea from concept to a finished iOS or Android app. We’ll work with you to prototype, design and build the app. When it’s ready to launch, we’ll help you deploy it in the Apple App Store and Google Play.

## Progressive Web Apps

Did you know that there’s a cost-effective alternative to developing an app? Apps are standalone applications installed on a device, while a progressive web app (PWA) is a website that functions like an app. PWAs can be accessed through a web browser, offer offline capabilities, and provide a more app-like experience without requiring a traditional app installation.

See how D2 Creative helped CooperSurgical digitize in-person education with a progressive web app, providing on-demand training and resources to healthcare providers. Read the case study to see how a PWA transformed their user experience and streamlined access to vital information.
