## Video Production and Digital Storytelling’s Role in Communications

Video production is a core part of D2 Creative’s heritage. We absolutely believe in the power of video to reach, inform, and influence your customers. We can help you take your story and share it in a way that’s both right on target and makes you say “Wow!”

Our in-house capabilities allow us to produce science documentaries, educational content, product demos, patient profiles, 2D and 3D animation, and more! Our advanced production and technical team also creates VR experiences, interactive media, and innovative tradeshow installations. We are currently updating our online video library. In the meantime, feel free to contact us with your specific needs and objectives and we can share with you relevant examples.

## Animation and Video Storytelling: Making Complex Topics Easily Digestible

Video is an effective medium for explaining and conveying highly complex topics to viewers, as it combines visual and auditory elements to engage multiple senses and enhance understanding. By utilizing engaging visuals, animation, and storytelling techniques, videos can break down intricate concepts into digestible and relatable information, making it easier for viewers to grasp and retain complex ideas.

For example, Luminations are animated [health education](https://www.d2creative.com/capabilities/content-development/health-education/) videos designed to simplify complex scientific concepts and create “aha!” moments for patients. These engaging and memorable videos help patients make informed decisions about their care by providing clear, accurate, and non-threatening information in an accessible format.

By applying adult learning principles and incorporating feedback from patient advocates, Luminations content ensures that the information resonates with the audience. These award-winning videos have been recognized for their effectiveness and are a low-anxiety, fun, and “sticky” form of patient education.

Watch examples of Luminations videos we’ve created for organizations including Cancer_Care,_ Pfizer, Stand Up To Cancer, and more. [See Our Work.](https://www.luminations.health/our-work/)

## In-House Video Capabilities

Very little of the video production and editing work in our projects get outsourced, as we have extensive resources available on-site at our New Jersey headquarters, including:

*   Production studio with green screen
*   Three digital editing studios
*   Motion graphics, 2D and 3D animation design
*   Concept treatments, script writing, storyboarding
*   Sound design

Like all video production companies, we also have an extensive network of talent (actors, models, voiceover, etc.), camera crews, casting agencies, and other production personnel with whom we work with for large and complex productions.

## Video Production Process: Conception to Distribution

Our clients often want something that’s never been done before – especially when it comes to video. Luckily, even the craziest new ideas have a similar process – though occasionally we may have to add a few new steps to the project!

### Concept Development

To start the process we’ll want you to tell us 3 things:

*   **What** you want, **when** you want it, and **how much** is budgeted.

That’s a great start. Next, we’ll want to know more:

*   What outcome are you looking for?
*   Who’s your audience?
*   What channels will you use to distribute the video, now and in the future? For example:
*   Projected at a meeting?
*   Watched from a computer on YouTube or your own website?
*   How long will your video(s) be?
*   Are there any brand or design guidelines that we’ll be following?
*   Are there previous videos we should match?
*   Who are the stakeholders and what will the review process be?

We’ll confirm with you every step of the way, which may include developing an initial creative treatment. When we’re in general agreement, we’ll shake hands with a contract or statement of work.

### Pre-Production

Before shooting, we nail down as many details as we can. Then we get to work on:

*   Scriptwriting (for documentary-style videos, this might be a list of interview subjects and questions, locations to shoot, shots to get, etc.)
*   Storyboarding (if needed)
*   Casting talent, or scheduling interview subjects
*   Booking camera crews, locations, travel
*   Set rental and wardrobe purchase
*   Testing (i.e. testing special effects makeup on-screen; live action lighting vs. CG; new shooting methods/cameras)
*   Fine-tuning budgets and timelines
*   Working out final specifications for the output format, distribution channels, etc.

#### Video Production

Your shoot may happen in the studio with sets or against a green screen, or on location as interviews or documentary-style footage. We may use one camera crew or several, or multiple switched cameras at a live event. Shooting can take place over days, weeks, or in a single afternoon. It may involve actors, key opinion leaders (KOLs), a crew of 20, or just a two-person crew with a producer.

No matter what, when the shooting’s done, we’ve got the files, backed up and ready to edit.

### Post-Production

Some people call this “editing,” but post-production is way more than editing. Here are some of the things that happen in “post”:

*   Screening/logging footage
*   Developing “paper” cut: editing notes for an editor to work from
*   Loading footage into the non-linear editing system
*   Editing rough cut (simple transitions, rough audio mix with “scratch” voiceover)
*   Graphic design
*   Video retouching
*   Selecting music
*   Motion graphics – 2D and 3D animation for transition, backgrounds, or any element that will be computer generated
*   Auditioning voiceover talent and recording voiceovers
*   Color correction
*   Fine cut (more complex transitions, final voiceover)
*   Sound design – adding sound effects, music, mixing
*   Encoding versions for different display formats as well as archival versions
*   Final QA
