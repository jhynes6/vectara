### CAPABILITIES

## Plan, Build & Execute Digital Marketing

D2 can support your team’s digital marketing at any level, from initial planning through day-to-day publishing. Our experts will help you create and implement your campaigns using proven, best-practice tactics that get results. After launch, we’ll monitor performance and provide ongoing reporting and analysis to your team.

## Lead Generation & Landing Pages

Our clients may vary in size and industry, but they all have one thing in common: they need qualified leads. Leads for their salespeople, leads for potential members or employees and leads for financial supporters and donors.

Over the years, we’ve implemented numerous lead-generation campaigns for our clients, from planning outreach efforts to building custom [landing pages](/digital-glossary/landing-pages/).

In order to build a successful campaign that [turns prospects into leads,](/turning-prospects-to-leads/) we start by meeting with our client to define goals and objectives. From there, we develop a customized lead generation campaign, which can include:

*   Campaign development
*   Defining KPIs to measure performance
*   Outreach tactics, such as email marketing, direct mail, print advertisements, geotargeting, and other paid and organic promotions
*   Measurement and reporting

## Precision Audience Targeting

No matter where or how your customers use the web, we know how to reach them. Audience targeting is a critical aspect of digital marketing that enables businesses to maximize the effectiveness of their campaigns. By understanding who your customers are and what they need, we can tailor the message and deliver it directly to [the right audience segments](/target-audience-segmentation/).

This level of precision targeting ensures that your marketing efforts are not wasted on irrelevant or disinterested individuals. Instead, you can focus your resources on reaching the people who are most likely to engage with your brand, increasing the chances of conversions, sales, and long-term customer relationships.

We’ll work with key stakeholders to learn information about your target audience, which we’ll use to create your custom program. This information may include:

*   Industry
*   Job title (e.g., VP of Sales)
*   Profession (e.g., Endocrinologist, Engineer)
*   Interests
*   Street address
*   Geolocation (e.g., Madison Square Garden)
*   Event attendance (e.g., CES)
*   Favorite websites & mobile apps

Audience targeting empowers businesses to optimize their marketing strategies and achieve better results by connecting with the right people at the right time.

## Reporting and Analytics: Digital Presence and Campaign Performance

If you manage the digital presence for your company, you’re probably tasked with providing analytics and measurement reports too. Unfortunately, the amount of data points to measure can be overwhelming. Too often marketers end up with tedious-to-produce spreadsheets with row after row of raw data that’s hard to explain to colleagues, or decks with screenshots from multiple platforms that need to be manually updated each reporting period.

Here’s where D2 can help. We’ll collect and interpret your data, articulate what should be addressed, and deliver a turnkey report that you can easily present and distribute to colleagues. In addition, we can build a dashboard with performance metrics that can be viewed by key stakeholders at any point.

## Make Analytics Actionable

Questioning if your efforts worked or if you need to modify your approach? Not with D2. First, we define your business objectives and determine the key performance indicators (KPIs) for your site. Since this information is critical to gauging success, we establish benchmarks for ongoing monthly comparisons.

After nailing down the goals and objectives, our team outlines **visitor demographics**, **sources of traffic**, **content performance**, **user engagement,** and more in a monthly report. Where necessary, we take deeper dives into the data and provide explanations for notable changes. Whenever we identify opportunities for improvement, we include those in the report each month as well.
