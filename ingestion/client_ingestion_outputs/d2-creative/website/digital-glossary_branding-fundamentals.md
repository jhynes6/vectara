#### What is Branding?

Branding shapes the way you communicate, both to external audiences and within the organization. It helps key stakeholders get a better understanding of things like:

*   Your brand’s benefits
*   What you’re promising your customers
*   Your organization’s purpose

Branding provides you with a strong set of core messages to use as a basis of all your messaging. It also provides you with the tone of voice and visual identity you’ll use.

**Don’t:** Abandon your new brand. Once you’ve finished the discovery process, you’ve just begun! You’ve got the beginnings a brand that aligns with who you are and where you’re going as an organization. Don’t set it free and expect that it will do its job unaided.
