## The
Challenge

## Our
Approach

## The
Result

Every month, our client was asked to prepare a website analysis and performance report for company leadership. The report generally consisted of rows of tabular data in a spreadsheet with a handful of top-line charts. Feeling like the task was not only tedious to prepare but did not give them the actionable results they wanted, the client turned to us for our recommendations. We took on this task for the client, believing there was a more efficient way to report and analyze website and advertising performance reports.

Our task was to create a turn-key website analysis report that was easy for our client to understand, present, and distribute to colleagues. First, we worked with our client to understand some of their key business objectives. We mapped these objectives to a series of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that would lead off each monthly report along with an executive summary that outlined the analysis in a concise, easy to understand way.

The balance of the report includes deeper dives into the data related to the initiatives the marketing team is focused on. Where needed, we provide analysis and explanations for any changes seen in the data. The report concludes with a series of recommendations for improvements.

We’ve created a visually appealing product that no longer takes days to complete, and arrives in a client’s inbox every month. Our product is easy to interpret, present and share. With this methodology, our client is better served with more reliable web performance report in a fraction of the time.
