## The
Result

Fresh branding helped TRIOSE find its niche, but the growing healthcare logistics company still needed a way to get its new messaging in front of healthcare systems. Competing against 800-pound industry gorillas, it was a struggle to cut through and show audiences the unique benefits TRIOSE offers. Fortunately, our [campaign was designed](/capabilities/digital-marketing/) to do just that.

Our strategy was a multi-faceted campaign designed to both raise awareness of TRIOSE as a whole and hone in on specific decision makers that we could turn into leads. This began with the production of four campaign-specific landing pages. Using the language and differentiation of our earlier [branding development](https://www.d2creative.com/our-work/healthcare-logistics-branding/), these pages were designed to bring TRIOSE’s many unique benefits to the forefront of our audience’s attention.

Getting the right eyes on these landing pages called for an intelligent game plan for the Google and LinkedIn ads designed to support our [video campaign](https://www.d2creative.com/our-work/healthcare-logistics-video-production/). We strategically chose our targeting based on both the goals of the ads and the audiences we wanted to reach platform to platform. This meant a broad, behavior-based targeting on Google, paired with LinkedIn paid ads with targeting that narrowed in on the specific job titles, companies, and demographics determined to be our most likely and important leads. We also leveraged programmatic [display advertising](https://www.d2creative.com/digital-glossary/display-advertising/), geotargeting specific businesses by their physical locations and IP addresses.

Finally, these efforts were supported by a far-reaching email campaign targeting the most important job titles and industries identified. This allowed us to reach hundreds of thousands of additional prospects in their [target audience](https://www.d2creative.com/target-audience-segmentation/).

By putting the focus on TRIOSE’s truly unique benefits, this campaign cut through the noise of their larger competitors and put more eyes on TRIOSE than ever before. This meant TRIOSE could leverage its new brand to introduce more healthcare systems to their custom, personal approach to logistics.
