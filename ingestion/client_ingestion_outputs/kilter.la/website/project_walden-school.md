## CONTEXT

The Walden School believes in nurturing a child's natural wonder and personal dignity. They provide a personalized, developmentally appropriate program that encourages responsibility, initiative, child-led inquiry, ethical behavior, and excellence. The program fosters the spirit of Renaissance learning and teaches that we all have stewardship for the world in which we live.

## THE ASSIGNMENT

Walden tasked Kilter with updating their brand identity in advance of the school's 50th anniversary and with creating a distinctive and flexible visual identity system that could be easily applied to a variety of touchpoints by their internal team.

## OUR SOLUTION

We began by redrawing Walden's cursive wordmark so that it was more legible and worked better at small sizes. We then created a vocabulary of abstract containing shapes to pair with the logo that were inspired by Walden's engagement with the natural world and commitment to diversity. These shapes became the building blocks of a bold graphic pattern language. Finally, we expanded and tweaked the existing Walden color palette to create a unified but flexible brand identity system that was unmistakably Walden.

> “The brand Kilter created has enabled us to make everything we publish look crisp, fresh, and seamlessly integrated. It has helped us in our tours and our follow-ups, a successful admission season, two fundraising campaigns that exceeded their goals, our annual report, and informational presentations for our community.”
