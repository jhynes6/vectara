# The Equity of  
Women's Schools

Being taught by women, led by women, believed in by women leads to drastic advantages for female students and ultimately a more equitable future. Yet single sex schools are facing perception challenges that inhibit demand from qualified applicants. As a majority women-owned company, we’ve led many such schools to avoid the following common pitfalls when addressing promising young female pupils and their families.

Oftentimes representation is an afterthought, frequently overlooked after balancing requests from opinionated stakeholders, limited resources and tight budgets. But always make time during the design review process to check for representation. It doesn’t have to be literal, but strive to show an environment rich with diversity—even among female-identifying students there is quite a bit of variance to celebrate. When partnering with She Should Run to encourage women to run for office in local government, YWCA Glendale asked Kilter to create an inclusive look and feel for the event. We took the opportunity to celebrate the movement of diverse women using color, energy and shapes.

Stats and figures can feel like a safe way to communicate value, but often fail to capture a female point of view and do little to relate to new recruits or convey what makes their unique experience so meaningful. When Kilter worked with The Webb Schools on their admissions materials, we sought to incorporate bold language that captured the remarkably empowering intangibles of a classroom full of young women. When we partnered with Marlborough School to boost their admission efforts, we centered our approach on telling the stories of individual students to illustrate how the value of single-gender education manifested in the lived experience individual girls.

The admission microsite we designed for Marlborough School centers on an interactive quiz that matches prospective families with profiles of current students based on shared interests, enabling interested students to more easily imagine themselves at Marlborough.

Look around the room. Is it absent of the female perspective? When we worked with Scripps College on their Title IX materials, we felt it was critical to gather female student voices to help shape the narrative—they were, after all, a key and untapped resource. We also employed the first person throughout the interior, a subtle but important gesture for addressing this audience with respect.

The Bottom Line

From the very beginning, research supports the notion that young girls thrive in single sex classrooms. Studies point to mitigating biases as a factor, so let's approach our communication with the same cognizance, gravitas, and vision for an equitable future.
