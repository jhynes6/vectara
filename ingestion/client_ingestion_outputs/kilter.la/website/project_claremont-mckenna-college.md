# Claremont McKenna College: Title IX Brochure

##### OVERVIEW﻿

Kilter developed a compassionate, user-centered guide to help Claremont McKenna College communicate Title IX processes and support options to survivors of sexual violence and harassment.

##### SERVICES

*   Publication Design
*   Copywriting

##### CONTEXT

Sexual assault and harassment remain pressing issues on college campuses nationwide, with many survivors finding institutional response systems difficult to navigate during an already traumatic time. While Title IX offices provide crucial services and support, the processes and options available to students are often presented in ways that can feel overwhelming or institutionally focused rather than survivor-centered.

Claremont McKenna College recognized the need to transform how this vital information was communicated to their student community, seeking to create resources that would truly serve and support survivors at their most vulnerable moments.

##### THE ASSIGNMENT

Develop a comprehensive guide to the Title IX process that would clearly communicate available options and resources while maintaining a supportive, trauma-informed approach that centers the individual student's experience rather than institutional procedures.

##### OUR SOLUTION

We approached this sensitive project by reimagining how institutional information could be presented through a more human, empathetic lens. The resulting brochure employs a deliberately restrained and calming design aesthetic to avoid overwhelming readers during what is often a difficult and vulnerable time in their lives.

The cover immediately centers the individual student's experience with a large-scale blind-embossed headline asking "What Happens Now?"—a question that humanizes what can feel like an intimidating institutional process. Inside, the content breaks down complex procedures into clear, actionable steps while consistently affirming the survivor's agency and choices throughout their journey.

The design thoughtfully balances the need for comprehensive detail with emotional accessibility, using careful language choices and visual hierarchy to help readers digest complex information without feeling overwhelmed. Practical considerations were also paramount: the back cover features a perforated tear-off flap with important contact information, ensuring crucial resources are always within reach.

Rather than simply outlining policies, the guide actively works to give voice to survivors while providing them with the clear, practical information they need to make informed decisions about their path forward. The end result is a resource that serves its vital institutional purpose while remaining firmly grounded in compassion and support for the individual student.
