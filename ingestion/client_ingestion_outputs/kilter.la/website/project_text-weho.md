# CAMPAIGN

City of West Hollywood: Text WeHo

##### OVERVIEW﻿

Kilter developed a visual brand and messaging for the City of West Hollywood’s community text alert program.

##### SERVICES

*   Graphic Design
*   Illustration  
*   Copywriting

##### CONTEXT

In the spring of 2023 the City of West Hollywood launched a new community text alert program designed to let residents subscribe to different subject channels for updates and announcements from WeHo on topics relevant to them. The program represented a unique opportunity to help shape a new standard of government text communications where residents receive useful information about topics they’re interested in.

##### THE ASSIGNMENT

Kilter partnered with the City of West Hollywood to develop a brand and campaign voice for this new program.

##### OUR SOLUTION

With a target audience of younger WeHo residents, this project gave us the excuse to indulge our maximalist streak. We crafted an exuberant Gen-Z-inflected design language that leveraged emojis, stickers, and a vibrant color palette to create a fun youthful personality. We paired this visual language with a winking, irreverent voice that telegraphed that this service was far from boring.

The launch of the new brand coincided with WeHo’s iconic annual Pride celebration, with ad placements on social channels and digital signage throughout the city, ensuring that tens of thousands of revelers got the message.
