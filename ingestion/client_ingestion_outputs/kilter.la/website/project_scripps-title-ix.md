# Scripps College: Title IX Brochure

## OVERVIEW

Kilter partnered with Scripps College to develop a publication aimed at survivors of sexual assault, abuse, or harassment that clearly explained the Title IX complaint process and the support resources available to them.

## SERVICES

* Publication Design
* Illustration
* Copywriting

## CONTEXT

Sexual assault on college campuses is a serious and pervasive problem. According to a 2015 report by the Association of American Universities, 11.2% of undergraduate or graduate students experience rape or sexual assault. For survivors, reaching out for support is often confusing and overwhelming. It can be difficult to know where to turn for help, what your rights are, and what to expect if you decide to file a complaint with your school’s Title IX office or the police.

## THE ASSIGNMENT

To address these challenges, Scripps College partnered with Kilter to create an empathetic and comprehensive student guide.

## OUR SOLUTION

We worked closely with Scripps’ Title IX Coordinator to curate the information that would be most important to survivors and present it in an intuitive and easily navigable format ensuring that students would be able to quickly find the information they needed when they needed it most. We structured a visual narrative that was geared towards the perspective of the survivor and not the institution. The final result is a brochure that feels entirely different from most Title IX communications—one that presents answers and support options to survivors in a way that makes them feel heard.

> Kilter was an amazing partner—thoughtful, creative, and fun to work with. They helped to translate complicated, voluminous, and potentially intimidating information into a concise and approachable piece. The piece has been very well received by the college community, and because it’s so accessible and user-friendly, it’s also proving to be an effective training and educational tool.”
