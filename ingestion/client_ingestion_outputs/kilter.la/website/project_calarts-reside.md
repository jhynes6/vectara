##### CONTEXT

Since its founding in 1970, California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) has set the leading edge of contemporary artistic practice. The Institute and its alumni have helped fuel the rise of a multifaceted L.A. creative scene that is among the most dynamic in the world, and inspired similarly enterprising artistic communities across East Asia, Europe and Latin America. Today’s CalArts community—high-achieving, eclectic, globally connected—encompasses a greater breadth and diversity of artmaking than at any point in the Institute’s history.

CalArts summer residency program provides a place for artists to experiment, collaborate and refine their work. It offers an escape from routine through 5 weeks of intense focus and field trips with mentors.

##### THE ASSIGNMENT

CalArts partnered with Kilter to drive interest and boost admission for their fledgling summer residency program.

##### OUR SOLUTION

We highlighted the student experience of living and working in the charged creative environment of CalArts by building a message-driven admissions campaign that reflected the experimental nature of the Institute. “Reside in the face of provocation. Reside in radical immersion. Reside at CalArts this summer.” We paired this messaging with a bold experimental image-making approach to fully capture the one-of-a-kind CalArts experience.
