# BRAND IDENTITY

## WeHo OUT

### OVERVIEW

Kilter partnered with the City of West Hollywood to develop a strong consumer-facing brand for its outdoor dining & shopping zone program.

### SERVICES

* Branding
* Copywriting
* Environmental Design
* Motion Graphics

### CONTEXT

The COVID-19 pandemic upended daily life for everyone. Especially hard hit were those small business owners who saw their revenues drop exponentially as stores and restaurants were forced to remain shuttered (or operate in a limited fashion) for months on end. Throughout the pandemic, The City of West Hollywood was attuned to these problems and committed to finding creative ways to respond to community needs and support businesses with solutions that protect health and safety.

### THE ASSIGNMENT

Kilter partnered with the city to develop a strong consumer-facing brand for its WeHo OUT Zone program. OUT Zones (Outdoor Use Temporary Zones) provided temporary outdoor space in public rights-of-way for restaurants, shops, and personal care establishments to operate safely outside.

### OUR SOLUTION

In framing the visual language and tone of voice for the brand we focused our efforts on crafting an identity that felt buoyant and optimistic—a deliberate contrast to the gloomy zeitgeist of the moment. The result of our collaboration was a vibrant recognizable brand that stood out in both the busy West Hollywood streetscape and the competitive social media landscape, capturing the attention and interest of its target audiences.

> “The brand Kilter created brought a lighthearted engaging spirit to what could have otherwise been a very dry subject. Response from our community so far has been overwhelmingly positive!”
