# CAMPAIGN

## Avoca’Do

### OVERVIEW﻿

Kilter partnered with Avoca’Do, makers of delicious plant-based pudding, to craft a compelling campaign that would launch them into a new market.

### SERVICES

*   Copywriting
*   Art Direction
*   Graphic Design
*   Motion Graphics

### CONTEXT

Avoca’Do is a delicious plant-based pudding made with fresh avocados and rich dark chocolate. Vegan, kosher, and free of cholesterol, dairy, and gluten—Avoca’Do is an indulgent snack that you don’t have to feel bad about eating.

### THE ASSIGNMENT

Avoca’Do turned to Kilter to help launch their product in a new regional market and grocery store chain via a targeted digital-first campaign.

### OUR SOLUTION

Rather than foregrounding Avoca’Do’s health benefits — which are obvious to most consumers — we focused on conveying just how delicious the unlikely pairing of chocolate and avocado are. With a cheeky tone of voice focused more on taste than calorie counting and product photography that showed off the simple natural ingredients we created an eye-catching and ownable launch campaign.
