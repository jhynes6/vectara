# BRAND IDENTITY

## OVERVIEW

We worked with Glendale Arts to establish a memorable and iconic identity for the Glendale International Film Festival.

## SERVICES

* Illustration
* Graphic Design

## CONTEXT

Founded in 2014 and ranked by Film Freeway as one of the Top 100 Best Reviewed Festivals in the World, Glendale International Film Festival (GIFF) is a celebration of the transporting power of the cinematic arts. The eight-day festival features in-competition and out-of-competition screenings at the iconic Laemmle Theatre, Q&As, and panel discussions; a film, screenplay, and student competition and awards ceremony; and networking opportunities with peers and industry professionals.

## THE ASSIGNMENT

In 2022 Glendale Arts, an award-winning 501(c)3 non-profit, took the helm of the festival following the passing of its founder Velvet Rhodes. Glendale Arts turned to Kilter establish a new evergreen visual identity that would help elevate GIFF's profile and usher in a new era for the festival.

## OUR SOLUTION

Playing on the similarity of the GIFF acronym to an airport code, we crafted an identity built around an iconic hero image that brought together the worlds of film and international travel, highlighting the global nature of the festival. The illustration style referenced the hand-drawn aesthetic of Polish film posters creating yet another nod to the world of international cinema.
