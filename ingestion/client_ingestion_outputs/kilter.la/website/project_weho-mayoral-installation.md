# BRAND IDENTITY

## West Hollywood Mayoral Installation

##### OVERVIEW

Kilter helped the City of West Hollywood celebrate the swearing in of its new mayor with an inaugural celebration that could only happen in WeHo.

##### SERVICES

* Illustration
* Social media design
* Signage design
* Cake üç∞

##### CONTEXT

The City of West Hollywood is a vibrant, progressive, arts-focused community, so when it came time to swear in their new mayor a staid institutional invite just wouldn‚Äôt do. Incoming Mayor John J. Duran chose to host his installation on the historic Sunset Strip with a theme of flower power that honored the city‚Äôs rich cultural heritage.

##### THE ASSIGNMENT

The City of West Hollywood tasked Kilter with developing an event identity and promotional collateral for the new mayor's installation ceremony.

##### OUR SOLUTION

We partnered with the city to create an appropriately groovy event identity that referenced 60s psychedelica and botanical illustration, then applied it to everything from the invitation, to social media promotional graphics, to signage. The final product was an event identity that was unmistakably West Hollywood.
