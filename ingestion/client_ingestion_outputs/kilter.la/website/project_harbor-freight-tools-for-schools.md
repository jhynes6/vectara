## CONTEXT

A program of The Smidt Foundation, Harbor Freight Tools for Schools is dedicated to advancing skilled trades education in American public high schools. Their flagship initiative, the Prize for Teaching Excellence, awards $1.5 million annually to outstanding skilled trades teachers and their programs nationwide.

Despite skilled trades being essential to America's infrastructure and economy, these educational pathways often lack recognition and resources. The Prize aims to reverse this trend by celebrating excellence and providing much-needed funding to innovative programs.

## THE ASSIGNMENT

In 2017, Harbor Freight Tools for Schools enlisted Kilter to create an ongoing digital campaign series to increase Prize awareness, drive qualified applications nationwide, and celebrate skilled trades education excellence.

## OUR SOLUTION

From the beginning, our approach centered on authentic storytelling that showcased both the grit of individual educators and their transformative impact on students' lives. To tell this story, we crafted a sturdy stripped-down visual aesthetic that employed bold typography, cinematic visuals, vibrant colors, and dynamic animation.

From these building blocks, we created a series of annual campaigns that capture the energy and importance of skilled trades education. We tackled deliverables from promotional videos, to marketing email sequences, to social media assets, to the Prize website itselfâ€”all designed to make the application process clear while positioning the Prize as a prestigious honor.

Working closely with the Harbor Freight Tools for Schools team, we've refined our strategy each year, resulting in record application numbers representing all 50 states and a growing community of Prize ambassadors who champion skilled trades education nationwide.
