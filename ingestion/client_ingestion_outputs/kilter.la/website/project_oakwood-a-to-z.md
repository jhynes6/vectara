##### CONTEXT

Founded in 1951 by parents who wanted to provide their children with an educational experience that was rich in the arts, sciences, and humanities and challenging to their creative, intellectual, and physical capacities, Oakwood School is a top rated, K–12 private school located in North Hollywood.

Oakwood children thrive in an environment where it is safe to ask questions and to take risks; where diversity in culture, opinion and learning style is valued; and where students are encouraged to ask questions, to experiment, and to share their ideas and their excitement.

##### THE ASSIGNMENT

Oakwood turned to Kilter to develop a microsite for new parents that cataloged the school's unique terminology as well as to create a library of email communication templates in order to standardize communications with their community.

##### OUR SOLUTION

We designed a split-screen visual glossary microsite that leveraged its nonstandard architecture to delight and engage users while reflecting Oakwood's joyful, nonconformist personality.

To complement the microsite, we designed a comprehensive suite of streamlined email templates with a clear content hierarchy, which we seamlessly integrated with the school's existing BlackBaud system.

> “Kilter listened to what our organization needed and delivered an elegant, scalable, and sustainable solution — all while being a joy to work with.”

We also helped Oakwood School drive excitement and interest in their schedule of prospective parent events through targeted print advertising.
