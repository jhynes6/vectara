# Discover CalArts

##### OVERVIEW

We were thrilled to promote the inaugural Discover Studio Art and Discover Animation programs for California Institute of the Arts (CalArts).

##### SERVICES

*   Copywriting  
*   Graphic Design
*   Motion Graphics
*   Social Media
*   Media Planning

##### CONTEXT

The Discover programs are intensive experiences that allow young artists an opportunity to engage with new and innovative work while thinking critically about what makes it art and developing their own individual artistic voices.

##### THE ASSIGNMENT

We partnered with CalArts to drive interest in the Discover programs among their target demographics and increase enrollment.

##### OUR SOLUTION

We created a vibrant visual language built around the idea of erasing surface layers to reveal variations on key messages, an allusion to the way the Discover programs help students to dive deep into their selected disciplines. We then activated the creative through a multi-touchpoint campaign which included videos, animated banners, and even a series of lenticular postcards.
