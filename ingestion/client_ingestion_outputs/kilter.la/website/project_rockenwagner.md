# SALES COLLATERAL

## OVERVIEW﻿

Kilter designed a flexible sales kit for Röckenwagner Bakery to give retail and restaurant buyers a taste of their delicious and innovative offerings.

## SERVICES

*   Graphic Design
*   Copywriting

## CONTEXT

Röckenwagner Bakery understands the needs of chefs because they're run by one. Their founder, Hans Röckenwagner, is a classically-trained chef who has helmed acclaimed restaurants in Germany, Switzerland, Chicago, and Los Angeles.

Röckenwagner’s delicious products are crafted in a state-of-the-art baking facility in Los Angeles where their team creates exceptional artisan breads and baked goods, 24 hours a day.

## THE ASSIGNMENT

Kilter partnered with Röckenwagner Bakery to develop a modular sales kit that told their brand story and detailed their offerings for retail and restaurant buyers.

## OUR SOLUTION

Since the needs of retail and restaurant buyers can be quite different we knew that our solution could not be a one-size-fits-all approach.

To achieve maximum flexibility, we created a modular system of sales sheets which could be curated to meet the needs of an individual buyer. We paired these sheets with an evergreen brand book that told the remarkable story of Röckenwagner’s growth and culture of innovation.

To house these pieces, we designed a branded folder that transformed the monumental R of the bakery's logo into a die cut window that showcased photography of Röckenwagner's mouth-watering baked goods. The end result? A delicious and customizable tool kit for wooing new clients.
