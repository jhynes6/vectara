# Building Community Engagement

Community lifts us up, fuels our compassion, and defends our dreams. It’s there when we need a friend, or two, or three hundred… That foundation we share is the building block of incredible achievements–of things we couldn’t do alone.

Always in awe of the power of community, we have spent the past few years championing the incredible efforts that bring families, friends, neighbors, and strangers closer together. We've worked with cities, social enterprises, political candidates, schools, and museums to engage their growing audiences.
