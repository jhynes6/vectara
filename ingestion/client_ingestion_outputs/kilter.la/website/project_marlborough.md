# Marlborough

##### OVERVIEW﻿

##### SERVICES
* Website Design
* Copywriting

##### CONTEXT
An independent school for girls located in the heart of Los Angeles, Marlborough offers both a middle school and upper school program on their unified campus. With students coming from neighborhoods across the city—including as far as Pasadena, Pacific Palisades, and the South Bay—Marlborough embraces differences, seek commonalities, and prioritize kindness to positively impact each other and the community.

##### THE ASSIGNMENT
Marlborough tasked Kilter with creating an interactive admissions microsite to attract new applicants.

##### OUR SOLUTION
There's no substitute for experiencing a school first-hand. A fact that's doubly true when it comes to girls' schools where the intangible value of the experience can often be hard to convey to outside audiences.

To bring admission audiences one step closer to the authentic Marlborough experience, we built a website centered on an interactive quiz. Website visitors are matched with profiles of current students based on shared interests. By serving first-hand accounts from like-minded Marlborough students, we allow applicants to imagine what their own Marlborough experience could look like while also capturing important data about applicants interests for the school's admission team.
