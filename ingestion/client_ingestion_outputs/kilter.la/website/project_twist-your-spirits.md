# Twist Your Spirits

##### OVERVIEW﻿

Kilter worked with direct-to-consumer cocktail kit purveyors, Twist Your Spirits to create a refreshed brand presence and frictionless e-commerce website.

##### SERVICES

*   Concepting
*   Brand Strategy
*   Art Direction

*   Illustration
*   Web Design

##### CONTEXT

Twist Your Spirits is an artisanal cocktail subscription service that was in need of customers. They had a great product that didn’t seem to be getting the attention it deserved.

##### THE ASSIGNMENT

Twist Your Spirits partnered with Kilter to help differentiate them from their competitors with a new e-commerce website and refreshed brand positioning.

##### OUR SOLUTION

Surveying the competitive landscape we quickly noticed that Twist Your Spirits' competitors all had one thing in common—a distincitively masculine (and often nostalgic) brand personality. We helped position the female-owned Twist Your Spirits, as a more contemporary, female-focused alternative to the cocktail bro culture that dominated the sector.

We crafted a fun, playful copywriting voice and art directed a new library of lifestyle photography that focused on the joyful social experience of sharing a drink with friends to create a welcoming, accessible brand.

Once we had defined their brand voice we crafted a streamlined new website for TYS that helped reduce friction in the discovery and purchase process. The result? A user-centered experience their audience can savor.

“Kilter was a great partner. Their fresh perspective was exactly what we needed to take our marketing message and website to the next level.”
