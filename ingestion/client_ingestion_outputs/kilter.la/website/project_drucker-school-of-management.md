## CONTEXT

The Peter F. Drucker and Masatoshi Ito Graduate School of Management stands out among business schools because of their approach to management as a fundamentally human endeavor that plays an essential role in creating a functioning society. The school prepares leaders with powerful, ethical, and universal management skills.

## THE ASSIGNMENT

The timeless wisdom of Peter Drucker is embedded in much of the school’s curriculum and communication, and they wanted a fresh, modern message-driven campaign to supplement those classic principles. Kilter partnered with the school to bring new relevance to those ideals in today’s world, with an aim to boost awareness and engagement across social media and, ultimately, increase applications from a growing audience.

## OUR SOLUTION

After conducting interviews and researching the competitive landscape, we kept coming back to a famous Peter Drucker quote: Management is a liberal art. That idea served as a foundational part of this campaign, which took on a humorous tone. The messaging pokes fun at corporate jargon and business lingo, while highlighting the school as a place for substance and deeper understanding. Also hidden in the complex patterns are nods to clipart and visual cliches frequently found in the business world. The School was thrilled with the #notmylingo direction, and quickly found consensus to launch the campaign across their various social media channels.
