# BRAND IDENTITY

## Glendale Tech Week

### CONTEXT

Located in the heart of Upstart Valley, Glendale is SoCalâ€™s fastest-growing hub for innovation and technology. Glendale Tech Week is a weeklong celebration highlighting the work happening in the City of Glendale and the region at large.

### THE ASSIGNMENT

Kilter was tasked with creating an arresting campaign identity to promote TechWeek as well as spinning up a comprehensive marketing campaign and event website all on an accelerated time table.

### OUR SOLUTION

After meeting with committee members and speaking to residents and business owners, we sought to create a strong visual narrative to distinguish the event, and the city. Known more for its shopping than its tech, Glendale faced awareness and perception challenges that called for something bold and innovative.

Ultimately, we created a striking blue campaign designed to stand out, with pixelating elements and fun illustrations that played out across the campaign, website, and identity materials. Playful messaging calls out Glendale as the Jewel City 2.0, and reflects a comfort with and understanding of the tech space in Glendale, when innovation peaks in the silicon mountains. The outcome? Attendance AND sponsorships more than doubled from the previous year, a big win for the community!
