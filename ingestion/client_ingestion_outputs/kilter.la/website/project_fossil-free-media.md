# CAMPAIGN

## Fossil Free Media

### CONTEXT

Fossil Free Media is a nonprofit media lab that supports the movement to end fossil fuels. They work with grassroots organizations and national coalitions to stop fossil fuel infrastructure and pressure federal decision makers to take on Big Oil and their enablers.

### THE ASSIGNMENT

Kilter was tasked with developing a national, branded campaign to end Big Oil's influence over our political process.

### OUR SOLUTION

As we dug in to the issue we quickly realized the challenge was less about convincing the public that Big Oil is a dangerous influence over our government, and more about convincing them that there is a solution to that problem. A successful campaign would not only need to grab the public’s attention but combat their apathy and sense of fatalism. We would need to harness the public’s optimism as well as their outrage.

Drawing inspiration from the public-spirited boosterism of WWII-era mobilization posters, we created a series of iconic illustrations that visualized not only the problem but also the solution. We paired the visuals with a confident active tone of voice to create an eye-catching and affirmative campaign platform that could break through the noise of typical environmental messaging.

> “We tasked Kilter with creating an attention-grabbing campaign that highlighted Big Oil's pernicious influence on our country's political process. Not only were they able to craft multiple compelling creative directions that fit the bill, they were also able to pivot quickly and rethink their creative approach when changing geopolitical events demanded a different tone. The end result was a clever, memorable campaign that spoke directly to the audiences we were targeting.”
