##### CONTEXT

The Center for Election Innovation & Research (CEIR) is a nonprofit whose core mission is to work with election officials to build confidence in elections that voters should—and do—trust. CEIR has a proven record of working with election officials from around the country and both sides of the aisle. Their team has spent decades building trust with key stakeholders in the field and is committed to a fiercely nonpartisan approach.

##### THE ASSIGNMENT

In preparation for the 2024 U.S. Presidential elections, CEIR engaged Kilter to modernize their brand identity and develop a robust, user-friendly web platform to showcase their extensive content.

##### OUR SOLUTION

Central to our rebranding strategy was the challenge of positioning CEIR as a trusted, nonpartisan authority in a highly polarized political landscape. We chose to eschew divisive visual cues, instead opting for a refined, professional aesthetic that underscored CEIR's technical expertise in election management and security.

The new logomark we designed encapsulates CEIR's mission through a series of multicolored checkmarks, symbolizing both the voting process and the diverse political voices CEIR represents. These checkmarks are nestled within a hexagonal shield, visually reinforcing CEIR's role in safeguarding electoral integrity and nurturing public confidence in the democratic process.

To complete the rebrand, we crafted a sleek, intuitive website that organizes CEIR's extensive research and news content into easily navigable sections. The new site architecture allows CEIR's varied audience—from election officials to researchers and the general public—to efficiently access and search through the organization's wealth of information.
