##### CONTEXT

In the space of a few short weeks, the Coronavirus crisis upended almost every aspect of American life. As the pandemic hit California, the City of West Hollywood quickly emerged as one of the communities in L.A. County hit hardest by COVID-19. Recognizing the seriousness of the unfolding situation West Hollywood acted swiftly to enact emergency measures aimed at saving lives and protecting both residents and businesses.

##### THE ASSIGNMENT

Starting in the early days of the pandemic, Kilter partnered with WeHo to develop communication materials focused on conveying vital information in a tone that was clear, calm, and distinctively West Hollywood.

##### OUR SOLUTION

Rather than having a single piece try to convey a laundry list of information, we worked with the city to create discrete targeted touchpoints that each addressed specific pieces of vital information. Headlines were short, to the point, and supported by clear, unambiguous graphics. We also worked to create a visual language and tone of voice that felt positive and reassuring even when conveying serious information.
