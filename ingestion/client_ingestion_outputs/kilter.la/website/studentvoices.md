# Amplifying the Student Voice

At Kilter, we believe in centering the student experience when crafting communication materials for our education clients. By prioritizing students’ voices in the design and messaging process, we help schools create impactful content that resonates with their target audiences.

## ADMISSION

In today’s competitive educational landscape, students and families are bombarded with countless indistinguishable admission materials. The sea of brochures, websites, and emails can easily blend together, leaving prospective students feeling overwhelmed and uninspired. By capturing genuine student experiences, schools can break through the noise and establish a unique voice that brings relatability and credibility.

The admission microsite we designed for Marlborough School centers on an interactive quiz that matches prospective families with profiles of current students based on shared interests, enabling interested students to more easily imagine themselves at Marlborough.

We helped The Webb Schools welcome a new class of students into the fold with a video that celebrated Webb's unique unbounded student experience.

We crafted a bold new visual language for Caltech's Center for Technology & Management Education to use in their admission materials. The refreshed brand bypassed the usual cliches of the sector and put the experiences of their student body of working professionals front and center.

We developed a viewbook for Vistamar School that took the form of a pocket-sized manifesto. The piece combined an overview of the school's one-of-a-kind educational approach with a series of personal accounts from students and alumni about the impact of Vistamar on their lives.

> “Kilter really captured the essence of our community. Their incredibly powerful work spoke to the unbounded spirit and sense of adventure at Webb. They were thoughtful in their approach and listened to our needs to create a fun video that spoke directly to our audience.”  
> Dr. Jamila Everett  
> Director of Admission and Financial Aid, The Webb Schools  

## FUNDRAISING

Framing outreach efforts around student outcomes establishes emotional connections that motivate donors. Highlighting the student experience inspires empathy and encourages donor investment. Sharing stories of transformed lives showcases the tangible impact of philanthropy.

We helped Saint Mark's School launch their latest fundraising campaign with a publication that framed the value of their upgraded campus in terms of the benefits to Saint Mark's students rather than just a laundry list of features.

We created a fundraising appeal for the launch of Children's Community School's endowment campaign that intertwined a narrative of the founding and growth of the school with an alumna's story of the difference that CCS made in her life.

> “Working with Kilter was a really enjoyable experience. From our first introduction on they were thoughtful collaborators who brought fresh ideas, listened well, and adjusted along the way. In the end, we have amazing materials that speak to our community and help us share our story!”  
> Irene Mason  
> Director of Advancement, Saint Mark’s School

## INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS

Effective internal communications can foster a sense of belonging and engagement among students, faculty, and staff. By centering student perspectives, schools create a cohesive and inclusive environment that empowers students. This student-centric approach strengthens the school community and fosters pride.

We partnered with Claremont McKenna College to create a brochure that gives a voice to survivors of sexual violence and harassment. The comprehensive guide to the Title IX process explains options in a way that is clear, supportive, and geared to the perspective of the individual student not the institution.

We worked with The National Association of Episcopal Schools (NAES) to design a poster/brochure aimed at helping their member schools better communicate the value and impact of an Episcopal education to their communities.

## The Bottom Line

By showcasing authentic student experiences, highlighting philanthropic impact, and reflecting genuine perspectives, schools foster inclusivity, connection, and engagement within their communities. At Kilter, we design for social impact, placing students at the forefront. Together, let's celebrate every student's voice.
