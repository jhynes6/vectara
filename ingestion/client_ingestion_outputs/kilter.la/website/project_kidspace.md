### 2022 ANNUAL REPORT MICROSITE

In 2023, Kidspace tasked us with developing a new brand language for their institutional and fundraising materials. Starting from the core building blocks of their marketing brand, we translated the wonder and discovery of the Kidspace experience into a sophisticated streamlined package. The end result captured the joy that defines Kidspace without feeling juvenile.

We applied the new brand language to an annual report microsite that further built upon the values of play and discovery through a unique split-screen design that surprises and delights viewers while pacing out potentially dense information into digestible and engaging chunks.

### STAR LIGHT, STAR BRIGHT FUNDRAISING CAMPAIGN

In 2020, as the world grappled with the COVID-19 pandemic, we collaborated with Kidspace to develop a fundraising campaign for the museum. During a time dominated by distance learning and virtual playdates, our campaign highlighted the unique and magical in-person experiences that only Kidspace could offer.

### 2017 ANNUAL REPORT

When we tackled Kidspaces' 2017 annual report the museums' then current design language was typified by maximal compositions and an exuberant use of color. To achieve a more sophisticated look for the report we stripped this approach back, reiniterpreting their core brands elements in a more elevated fashion. By expanding their visual language to include gradients, we covered the complete spectrum with fewer elements. The narrative we developed emphasized the access, joy, and power of play the museum brings to the community every year.
