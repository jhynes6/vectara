## CONTEXT

Caltech is a world-renowned science and engineering Institute that attracts the brightest minds in the field to address fundamental scientific questions and pressing societal challenges. Given this pedigree, it might come as a surprise that Caltech is also home to a world-class performing arts series.

## THE ASSIGNMENT

When CaltechLive approached us to brand their 2018–19 season we faced a challenge: in a crowded marketplace like Los Angeles where dozens of other performing arts venues compete for the same audience, how can they stand out?

## OUR SOLUTION

Our solution was to lean into what makes CaltechLive unique: its status as a performing arts series embedded within a world-class science and engineering school. Drawing inspiration from a past CaltechLive performer who declared that “music is where math meets emotion,” we crafted a visual system and tone of voice that highlights the intersection of science and the arts. The resulting positioning is something that only Caltech can claim, elevating and distinguishing them from their competitors.
