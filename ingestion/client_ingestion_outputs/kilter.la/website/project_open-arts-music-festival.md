# Open Arts & Music Festival

## OVERVIEW

We partnered with Glendale Arts to rebrand the 3rd annual Open Arts & Music Festival, a free family-friendly event with live music, an arts market, a beer garden, temporary public art installations, and all-day activities for children.

## CONTEXT

Launched in 2016, and presented by Glendale Arts and the Downtown Glendale Association, the festival is a free all-ages event that connects members of the local community to the arts and one another.

## THE ASSIGNMENT

Glendale Arts enlisted Kilter to develop an updated brand, website, and marketing campaign to help expand the reach of the event going into its third year.

## OUR SOLUTION

We designed a dynamic look & feel that visually depicts the way OAM brings together artists and audiences and paired it with a headline that distills the appeal of the event to three simple beats — “Art, Music, You.” We applied the resulting identity to a variety of marketing touchpoints — from a website, to digital & outdoor advertising, and print collateral. The end result was an exciting message-driven campaign that helped to drive a 33% increase in attendance from the prior year.

## RESULTS

33% Increase in Attendance over previous year
