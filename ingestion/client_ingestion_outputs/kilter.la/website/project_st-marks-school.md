### CONTEXT

Founded in 1960, Saint Mark’s School nurtures students from preschool through sixth grade, emphasizing strong academics, character building, diversity, and spiritual growth. The school’s philosophy balances social-emotional development with intellectual pursuits, providing a supportive environment for young learners.

In 2023, Saint Mark’s launched a transformative campaign to fund crucial campus improvements, including a new early childhood education center and elementary sports court.

### THE ASSIGNMENT

Kilter was tasked with creating a compelling fundraising brochure and video to inspire the Saint Mark’s community. Our challenge: to vividly illustrate how these enhancements would elevate the Saint Mark's experience and motivate generous support from the school community.

> “Working with Kilter was a really enjoyable experience. From our first introduction on they were thoughtful collaborators who brought fresh ideas, listened well, and adjusted along the way. In the end, we have amazing materials that speak to our community and help us share our story!”

### OUR SOLUTION

Rather than just enumerating a laundry list of campus upgrades, we crafted a campaign narrative that instead focused on how these improvements would amplify Saint Mark’s core values and transform the student experience.

The headline we crafted for the cover of the brochure invited community members to "Envision a place for... exploration, laughter, community, growth, celebration, discovery, revelation, mastery, friendship, courage, breakthroughs, play, collaboration, inquiry, understanding, joy, affirmation, everyone." This thematic thread wove through the entire piece, with sections like "A place for growth" highlighting preschool facility upgrades and "A place for play" showcasing improved sports courts. The brochure culminated in "A place for generosity," a heartfelt appeal reminding families that their support was crucial in bringing this vision to life.

To complement our messaging, we developed a series of joyful, watercolor-style illustrations depicting the vibrant community moments these upgrades would foster. This approach both forged an emotional connection with readers and elegantly addressed the practical challenge of limited architectural renderings.

Building on the brochure’s foundation, we expanded our narrative into a short fundraising video. This piece brought the everyday student experience to life while illuminating how the proposed upgrades would enhance the Saint Mark’s journey for every child.
