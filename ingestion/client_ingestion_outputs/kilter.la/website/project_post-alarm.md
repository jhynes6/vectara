### THE REBRAND

For decades, Post's visual identity was defined by the octagonal shape of their logo and lawn signs. While once a unique differentiator, the shape had long become ubiquitous in the security sector and was no longer proprietary to Post. Using the familiar shape as our jumping off point, we translated the octagon into the visual metaphor of the shield, a simple device that embodies the protection Post offers its customers.

To complement the updated logo we fully overhauled Post's visual identity system with a vibrant new color palette and an illustration style that served as an extension of the formal language established by the logo. Finally to modernize the half-century-old brand we crafted a compelling new copywriting voice and messaging system focused on the emotional pull of protecting the things you love.

### DIY CAMPAIGN

We debuted the updated brand with a launch campaign for Post's new Light & Easy bundle, an entry-level DIY alarm package. To cut through the noise of a crowded security marketplace, we deliberately avoided the fear-based messaging common in the sector and instead built a friendly and approachable campaign focused on the importance of protecting the people (and pets) you love.

### NIGHT SHIELD CAMPAIGN

Close on the heels of our initial brand rollout we helped Post launch yet another innovative offering, their Night Shield service. Using smart camera technology Night Shield allows Post to automatically detect suspicious activity at a customer's home and rapidly deploy a patrol response, often before the homeowner even realizes there is an issue.

To promote the new service we created a TV commercial as well as a series of print ads, and direct mail pieces that explained the multi-step process in a simple and clear way, highlighting the benefits and ease of the service.

### PEOPLE OF POST CAMPAIGN

As a 3rd-generation family-owned business with deep roots in the community, Post offers unmatched experience in the Southern California security sector. To highlight this expertise, we launched a multi-channel campaign focused on celebrating the people who make up Post's award-winning team. From the owners, to the patrol officers, to their command center operators, Post's employees are all proud members of the communities in which they operate. Our campaign focused on how this local know-how intersected with Post's cutting-edge technological offerings to offer unparalleled peace of mind to their customers.
