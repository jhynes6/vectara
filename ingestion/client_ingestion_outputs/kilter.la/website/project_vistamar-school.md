## CONTEXT

Vistamar School believes high school shouldn’t be a means to an end, but an end in and of itself. Focused on cultivating balanced, engaged students, Vistamar prides itself on teaching students how to think, not what to think.

## OUR SOLUTION

Our solution focuses on student experience, with candid, intimate photography that captures authentic moments of interaction and discovery. To convey the immersive nature of the academic experience, we crafted a visual system where text and imagery are woven together to create a fluid visual landscape. The result is a viewbook as singular as Vistamar itself.
