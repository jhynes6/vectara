# BRAND IDENTITY

## SAJE: LA For Everybody

### CONTEXT

Strategic Actions for a Just Economy (SAJE) has spent over two decades working alongside LA residents to build community power and fight for equitable housing. Their grassroots approach has established them as a leading voice for tenant rights and economic justice in South Los Angeles.

As SAJE prepared to host their first major fundraising gala, they needed an identity that would honor their community-driven mission while appealing to potential donors and supporters.

### THE ASSIGNMENT

Design a brand identity for SAJE's inaugural fundraising gala—LA For Everybody—that would authentically represent their work and values while creating an engaging experience for attendees and donors.

### OUR SOLUTION

Our visual identity for "LA For Everybody" draws from the city's street signs and commercial vernacular, using the custom typeface Mulwray—itself an homage to vintage LA street signage. This approach grounds the gala's identity in the lived experience of everyday Angelenos while elevating the grassroots authenticity that defines SAJE's work.

The resulting design speaks directly to SAJE's belief that the future of Los Angeles' neighborhoods should be decided by those who call them home. It celebrates the organization's legacy of community empowerment while inviting supporters to join their movement for housing justice and economic equity.

### TESTIMONIAL

“We partnered with Kilter to develop a brand for our annual fundraising gala. The solution they crafted was bold, memorable, and strategically aligned with our mission and vision. They were a pleasure to work with and we couldn't be happier with the results.”
