# CAMPAIGN

## City of STEM

### OVERVIEW

Kilter created a playful brand identity for LA's official science festival that inspired tens of thousands to experiment with STEM. Working closely with the Columbia Memorial Space Center, we developed an authentic approach that caught the eye of families across Los Angeles and drove exponential growth for the event.

### CONTEXT

City of STEM is LA's Official Science Festival and the largest free-to-attend STEM program in Southern California. Their mission is to create accessible ways for learners of all ages to experience STEM and inspire the next generation of scientists, technologists, engineers, and mathematicians. The festival presents a no-cost launch event in conjunction with LA Maker Faire, then promotes STEM experiences throughout the month.

### THE ASSIGNMENT

Kilter was tasked with creating a brand identity that authentically represents the joy of STEM, celebrates the breadth of experiences available, and captures the attention of busy parents. We also needed to establish a media strategy that would build word-of-mouth and fuel interest with a limited budget.

### OUR SOLUTION

Beginning in 2019, we established a playful visual style that collaged illustration and photography to create immersive tableaus that celebrated the world of STEM. This approach showcased City of STEM's wide breadth of offerings while establishing a sense of wonder and discovery. The quirky campaign sparked curiosity, drove interest, and improved event attendance.

As the festival evolved, we continued to refine the visual language to be more impactful and ownable with a greater focus on illustration. We leveraged content partnerships with parent blogs, grew our grass-roots marketing efforts, and fueled word-of-mouth through targeted digital campaigns. To maximize the vast network of partners, we created a social media toolkit that empowered museums, celebrity talent, and other partners to promote the event effortlessly.

In 2023, when City of STEM partnered with Maker Faire LA, we further evolved our approach to incorporate illustration centered around Makie the robot—the Maker Faire mascot—and leveraged a nostalgic visual aesthetic that referenced 70s educational touchstones like Sesame Street and Schoolhouse Rock. As City of STEM continues to grow, we remain committed to exploring fresh creative directions that capture the wonder of science while expanding the festival's reach and impact across Los Angeles.
