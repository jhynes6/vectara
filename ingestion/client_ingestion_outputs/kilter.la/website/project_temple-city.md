# PUBLICATION DESIGN

## Temple City: Connect Magazine

### OVERVIEW

Kilter worked with Temple City to redesign and relaunch the city's flagship publication.

### SERVICES

*   Concepting
*   Art Direction
*   Publication Design
*   Illustration
*   Copywriting

### CONTEXT

Founded in 1923 in Southern California's San Gabriel Valley, Temple City is a suburban residential community home to a diverse and vibrant population.

In addition to the print publication we developed animated versions of select ads to run on the city's social media channels.

### THE ASSIGNMENT

Temple City tasked Kilter with reimagining their biannual magazine to better represent & engage their population and connect them with important happenings at City Hall.

### OUR SOLUTION

We eschewed the jam-packed newsletter approach often favored by governmental publications opting instead for a quieter, more deliberately-paced publication. We also helped to streamline content and make important information more accessible by separating Temple City’s recreation class schedule into a separate booklet nestled within the main publication. The end result was a magazine that brought over 15,000 households into the fold.
