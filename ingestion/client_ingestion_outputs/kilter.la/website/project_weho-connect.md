# CAMPAIGN

## WeHo Connect

### OVERVIEW

### CONTEXT

Founded in 1984 by an unlikely coalition of LGBT activists, seniors, and renters, West Hollywood is a city like no other in the world. With a vibrant arts scene, a thriving LGBTQ+ population, and a robust spirit of community activism and civic pride, WeHo continues to make a disproportionately large impact on the cultural life of Southern California. There’s a lot going on around town, but too often the city found WeHoans were missing out on local news and action.

### THE ASSIGNMENT

Kilter partnered with the City of West Hollywood to develop a multi-channel advertising campaign aimed at boosting followers for the city's social media channels.

### OUR SOLUTION

Kilter created a campaign that plays with the idea of newsworthiness to promote WeHo and help residents connect to the city on social media. The artwork was designed to grab attention across print, outdoor and digital environments while having fun with what makes WeHo unique. Our work led to a 15% increase in followers within 7 months, and was awarded the 2018 CAPIO Epic award for Excellence in Public Information and Communications. It even caught the attention of City of West Hollywood Mayor John Heilman, who commented “This CAPIO award is affirmation that we’re leading the way among small cities in how we engage with the community.”
