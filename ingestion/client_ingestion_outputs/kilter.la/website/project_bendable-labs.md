## CONTEXT

Bendable Labs is a technology, consulting, and research firm that aims to improve economic stability, mobility, and opportunity for people across the United States.

Spun out of the Drucker Institute at Claremont Graduate University, Bendable Labs designs, builds, and tests social innovations in the areas of lifelong learning, workforce development, and job quality.

## THE ASSIGNMENT

Kilter first partnered with the Bendable Labs team when they were a fledging startup housed at Claremont Graduate University's Drucker Institute. We worked closely with them to market and refine their flagship product Bendable, a digital hub for learning resources.

When the time came for Bendable Labs to launch as a standalone company, they turned to Kilter to establish a brand identity, website, and collateral.

## OUR APPROACH

In developing the Bendable Labs brand, we were faced with the challenge of crafting an identity that felt both related to and distinct from their similarly named flagship product Bendable. We started with the same visual building blocks employed in the product's identity, then refined and recontextualized them to establish a more expansive and elevated system.

The logo we created—an abstract mark drawn from a detail of the Bendable logo—serves as a reference to Bendable Labs' 10,000 foot view of the interrelated pieces of the jobs and education landscape. We also reimagined the linear "learning path" graphic device that plays a central part in Bendable's visual identity as an endless patterned plane, reflective of Bendable Lab's broader focus.

To round out the identity system we created an iconographic illustration style inspired by the work of designer and activist Gerd Arntz, a nod to the social mission of the organization.

> “Working with Kilter has always felt like a true partnership. They took the time to truly understand our team culture, our work and our mission. They embraced our human-centered approaches to designing our offerings and stepped in with marketing and branding expertise that they seamlessly applied to our social impact space. I can honestly say that we would not be scaling our products and growing our business as we are today without our partnership with Kilter.”
