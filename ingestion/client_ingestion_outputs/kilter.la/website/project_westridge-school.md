## CONTEXT

Since 1913, Westridge School has been a beacon of excellence in girls’ education. As the institution entered a new era—marked by fresh leadership, an innovative curriculum, and a reinforced commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice—it sought a brand refresh that would reflect these pivotal changes while preserving its rich heritage.

## THE ASSIGNMENT

We partnered with Westridge to update their visual identity and brand messaging.

## OUR SOLUTION

Through extensive conversations with Westridge students, faculty, and alumnae, we uncovered a defining characteristic: Westridge is more than just an excellent college preparatory institution. It's a nurturing environment where girls are given the freedom and support to explore, take chances, and grow on their unique paths to success.

Recognizing Westridge’s role as a launch pad for lives of impact, we centered the updated brand around this concept with the powerful tagline: "Where the First Draft of Extraordinary is Written." Our messaging system was carefully crafted to highlight both Westridge’s exceptional academic outcomes and the customizability of the individual student experience with headlines that captured this essence, such as "Discover Your Origin Story at Westridge" and "Infinite Space for Unstoppable Girls."

To complement the updated messaging system we defined a playful new visual identity that leveraged the breadth and depth of the Westridge experience with a bespoke illustration library that showcased every dimension of the student experience. We then integrated these new brand elements across multiple touchpoints including a reimagined viewbook; a dynamic, user-friendly homepage; and an engaging marketing campaign.

The new brand platform celebrates Westridge as a place where young women don't just prepare for college, but for life, a positioning that resonates deeply with prospective families, as well as the current school community. This refreshed brand presentation sets the stage for increased enrollment, enhanced community pride, and a reinforced position as a leader in girls’ education.

> “No two phrases are better suited for our girls’ school than these: ‘Waiting for the World to Catch Up Since 1913,’ and ‘Where the First Draft of Extraordinary is Written.’ They are somehow fresh yet familiar, magical yet ‘well, duh!’ In both, there are no clichés, and neither are there at Westridge. I'll be second in line for those tote bags!”
