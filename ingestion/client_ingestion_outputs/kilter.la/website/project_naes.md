##### CONTEXT

The National Association of Episcopal Schools (NAES) is the only national pre-collegiate educational organization that is Episcopal in character, supporting approximately 1,200 Episcopal schools and early childhood education programs throughout the country. Founded in 1965, NAES advances Episcopal education by providing essential services, resources, and networking opportunities focused on Episcopal school identity, leadership, and governance.

NAES needed to reimagine their key communications piece about Episcopal education. The existing double-sided text-heavy poster format was proving impractical and overwhelming for audiences, limiting its effectiveness in reaching diverse stakeholders from member schools to prospective families.

##### THE ASSIGNMENT

NAES tasked Kilter with transforming their core educational principles document into an engaging, multi-purpose communication piece that would be both practical and inspiring. The piece needed to serve multiple audiences and functions: demonstrating the value of NAES membership to schools while also providing those schools with an effective tool for communicating Episcopal education's values to prospective families.

##### OUR SOLUTION

We approached this challenge holistically, rethinking both the format and content strategy. Working closely with NAES, we streamlined and rewrote the text into clear, accessible language that would resonate with diverse audiences while maintaining the depth of Episcopal education's principles.

Our innovative hybrid format resolved the practical limitations of the previous poster design. The piece unfolds to display as an inspiring poster that visualizes Episcopal education's core values. It also functions equally well as an informative brochure that schools can use in admissions conversations.

Using a playful illustration language, we created scenes that depict core values in action—from students planting gardens to represent growth and stewardship, to community gathering spaces that emphasize inclusion and fellowship. The illustrations are complemented by carefully balanced typography that maintains readability across both formats.

The result is a versatile communication tool that serves multiple strategic purposes: schools can display it to spark interest in Episcopal education, use it as a detailed brochure during recruitment conversations, or leverage it to strengthen their connection to NAES. The design demonstrates how thoughtful visual storytelling and smart format choices can make complex institutional values both accessible and engaging for diverse audiences.
