# BRAND IDENTITY, WEBSITE & CAMPAIGN

Kilter crafted a brand identity, website, and marketing campaign for sustainable design pioneers CarbonShack.

## CONTEXT

CarbonShack is a new kind of architecture firm, one that represents a holistic approach to green design. Their skilled artisans, talented in-house architects, and interior designers craft environmentally sustainable home environments inspired by the beauty of nature. Their integrated approach to custom interiors, home furnishings, and construction means top-quality, personalized service with an abiding passion for sustainability.

Kilter worked closely with CarbonShack to launch a new brand identity, inspired by the same natural aesthetics that inform their work and to update and evolve their marketing materials as their offerings grew.

## THE ASSIGNMENT

When CarbonShack launched a new line of home furnishings and accessories, Kilter was tasked with rolling out a multi-channel marketing campaign and redesigning their website from the ground up to incorporate a new e-commerce store.

## OUR SOLUTION

To anchor both the campaign and the website, we developed messaging that highlighted the ways that CarbonShack draws inspiration from the natural world to develop modern sustainable home environments that defy the expectation that green homes must also be austere modernist boxes.

CarbonShackâ€™s vast set of offerings (everything from bathroom remodels, to textile designs, to building performance optimizations) meant that the new site had a lot of ground to cover. Working closely with CarbonShack, we crafted language and an information architecture to connect their diverse offerings into a larger brand story that was compelling and memorable. We devised an intuitive user experience that made it easy for customers to find what they were looking for while also being exposed to other services under the CarbonShack umbrella.
