## CONTEXT

One of the biggest pain points of running a small business is doing the books and keeping an accurate record. Even with all the available tools in the marketplace, owners run into problems when it comes time to filing taxes for their personal and business finances. Anchor Bookkeeping was established to bring together the convenience of digital technology with the expertise of skilled bookkeepers guaranteeing the quality of service while delivering accurate financial reporting to give small businesses the peace of mind they need.

## THE ASSIGNMENT

Anchor turned to Kilter to help define a brand and marketing strategy that would appeal to small business owners.

## OUR SOLUTION

Through focus groups and competitive research we helped Anchor hone in on a specific audience — startups and entrepreneurs at a critical growth juncture — and develop a brand that spoke to their needs and concerns with a vibrant visual language and aspirational tone of voice. We applied the brand identity to a website and marketing touchpoints that ranged from a social media campaign to podcast advertising.

As part of our strategy to build awareness of the Anchor brand, we advertised on podcasts such as the Marketplace Morning Report that appealed to our target demographic.
