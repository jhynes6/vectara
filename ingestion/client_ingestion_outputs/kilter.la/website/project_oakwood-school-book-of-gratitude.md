## CONTEXT

Oakwood School was founded in 1951 by parents who wanted to provide their children with an educational experience that was rich in the arts, sciences, and humanities and challenging to their creative, intellectual, and physical capacities. They wanted a learning community which would foster independence of thought, intellectual integrity, sensitivity to the needs of others, and prepare students for participation in a democratic society.

## THE ASSIGNMENT

Oakwood approached Kilter to develop a narrative concept and visual design for The Book of Gratitude, its annual report publication.

## OUR SOLUTION

Focusing on the idea of gratitude we designed an annual report that highlighted stories from members of the Oakwood community, giving them a platform to talk about what Oakwood means to them. It also became an opportunity for the school to reflect back gratitude to the parents, alumni, and students who do so much to support them.

We paired this narrative with a colorful and vibrant visual language that captured the energetic and pluralistic spirit of the school. Building on that narrative we developed a multi-touchpoint campaign to launch Oakwoodâ€™s annual fund appeal creating a consistency of storytelling that helped to drive engagement and giving.
