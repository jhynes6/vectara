## CONTEXT

Scripps College was founded, in 1926, with the mission of educating women for lives of commitment and engagement. As the college approached its centennial, it undertook a strategic planning process to ensure a future filled with infinite possibility for the 21st century and beyond.

## THE ASSIGNMENT

Scripps partnered with Kilter to roll out their centennial vision plan to the broader college community through a printed piece and a dedicated microsite.

## OUR SOLUTION

We crafted an elegant and aspirational visual system paired with a photographic language that was (literally) forward-looking, highlighting members of the Scripps community to personalize the impact of their new Centennial Plan.
