# Lumen Energy

##### OVERVIEWï»¿
Kilter partnered with solar energy innovator Lumen Energy to craft a personalized outreach campaign to prospective customers.

##### SERVICES
*   Brand Positioning
*   Strategy
*   Copywriting
*   Graphic Design

##### CONTEXT
Lumen Energy is a different kind of solar energy provider. Focusing on the commercial sector, Lumen offers a frictionless approach that makes going solar as easy as signing up for a credit card. Lumen manages the process from start to finish, covering all installation and equipment costs, and even paying building owners an upfront cash bonus for making the switch.

##### THE ASSIGNMENT
Lumen Energy tasked Kilter with crafting a personalized marketing campaign that targeted the owners of commercial buildings and explained in a clear and compelling fashion the unique benefit of partnering with Lumen to go solar.

##### OUR SOLUTION
Using smart segmentation and variable data printing we crafted a series of customized touchpoints tailored to each prospect with individualized data about their potential solar savings and the needs of their specific industry. By personalizing the appeal and quantifying the business impact of going solar we were able to create a compelling campaign that reframed the typical solar discussion.
