### CONTEXT
Community Schools go beyond traditional education, offering a holistic approach that combines core academics with expanded learning opportunities and comprehensive support services. These schools address students' physical, mental, and social-emotional needs through strategic partnerships with diverse community organizations. They serve as vibrant centers where educators, families, and neighbors unite to foster innovative learning environments.

Pasadena Unified School District (PUSD) faced the challenge of effectively communicating the unique value and impressive outcomes of its nine Community Schools to stakeholders and the wider community.

### THE ASSIGNMENT
PUSD entrusted Kilter with the crucial task of developing a cohesive visual identity and key communication assets for its nine Community Schools. This new identity needed to serve dual purposes: articulating the district's visionary approach to these schools and spotlighting the individual success stories of each location.

### OUR SOLUTION
Our approach to this challenge was multifaceted and comprehensive. We initiated the process with in-depth stakeholder interviews, uncovering compelling narratives from the advocates, principals, and partners who breathe life into Pasadena's Community School model. This mosaic of diverse experiences and insights formed the foundation of the comprehensive 36-page impact report we authored, which vividly illustrates PUSD's Community School philosophy, benchmarks, and success stories.

Building on these insights, we developed a bold, unifying visual identity for the nine Community Schools. This dynamic system visually represents how these programs synergize a wealth of partners and resources, creating an impact greater than the sum of its parts. At the heart of this system lies a bespoke iconography set, each icon symbolizing a unique strength of the Community Schools.

To ensure widespread adoption and consistency, we translated this new brand platform into a versatile toolkit, empowering each school with resources for impactful social media, marketing, and signage. This user-friendly approach ensures consistent, compelling communication with all stakeholders across the district.

Through this comprehensive strategy, we've equipped PUSD's Community Schools with a powerful narrative and visual language to showcase their innovative approach and remarkable achievements. The result is a cohesive, engaging identity that effectively communicates the value and impact of these vital educational hubs to the broader community.
