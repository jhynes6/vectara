# PACKAGING DESIGN

## Todo Verde

### OVERVIEW﻿
When it came time to launch their first ever line of vegan seasonings, Todo Verde turned to Kilter to create packaging that encapsulated the spirit of their brand and would appeal to both the health-conscious and those who’ve never considered eating plant-based before.

### CONTEXT
Founded in 2015 by Chef Jocelyn Ramirez, Todo Verde is on a mission to advance food equity while helping home cooks create healthy and delicious Abuelita-approved plant-based Mexican meals.

### THE ASSIGNMENT
Already celebrated for their cooking classes, catering, and cookbook Todo Verde tasked Kilter to design the packaging for their inaugural line of seasonings.

### OUR SOLUTION
We employed vibrant colors and evocative illustrations to celebrate the healthy, Mexican flavors that inspired the recipes and ensure that the packaging stood out on retail shelves. The end result was a set of premium packaging that helped to elevate the Todo Verde story and widen its community of passionate fans.

> “The Kilter team designed such beautiful and thoughtful packaging for our first product line. From the label design to the branded boxes, every element of our packaging feels intentional, premium quality, and so vibrant! Our community of customers love all the elements of our unique design.”
