# CAMPAIGN

City of West Hollywood: Homeless Services

##### CONTEXT

In recent years, homelessness has emerged as a pressing challenge for the City of West Hollywood. Despite its reputation for cultural diversity and progressive policies, the city has seen a notable increase in the number of individuals experiencing homelessness. Encampments have become a visible presence in certain neighborhoods, highlighting the urgency of the issue. However, West Hollywood remains steadfast in its commitment to tackling homelessness head-on. Through collaborative efforts with local organizations, government agencies, and community stakeholders, the city has implemented multifaceted approaches aimed at providing housing, support services, and resources to those in need.

##### THE ASSIGNMENT

Kilter partnered with the City of West Hollywood to develop a look and voice for their homeless services division and roll out a series of campaign assets.

##### OUR SOLUTION

Designed to speak to both homeless individuals in need of services and business owners & residents concerned about how the city was addressing the problem, West Hollywood’s homeless campaign employed a bold illustrative treatment to highlight the homeless as individuals, humanizing an issue that can often seem vast and impersonal.
