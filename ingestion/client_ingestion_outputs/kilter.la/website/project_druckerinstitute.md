### CONTEXT

Founded in 2006, the Drucker Institute was established to carry on the work of pioneering management consultant Peter Drucker—hailed by BusinessWeek as “the man who invented management.”

Mirroring Drucker's own belief that a functioning society requires effective management of the private, public, and nonprofit spheres, the Institute was home to a wide variety of programs that promoted effective management across all sectors. Over the years, the Institute's broad portfolio of offerings included everything from a prize recognizing nonprofit innovation to a partnership with The Wall Street Journal ranking America's best managed companies.

### THE ASSIGNMENT

As the Institute's agency of record, Kilter worked closely with the Drucker team to evolve the organization's brand and launch countless programs and deliverables.

### OUR SOLUTION

Peter Drucker famously viewed management as a liberal art, a view reflected in the Drucker Institute's belief that effective management is both a business and a moral imperative. With this as our jumping off point, we worked with the Institute to craft a refreshed brand identity that highlighted their mission of "strengthening organizations to strengthen society." The updated brand centered on a bold tagline "Manage with courage" that highlighted the moral dimensions of effective leadership.

In evolving the brand's visual identity we adapted the Institute's existing asterisk logomark into a richly layered pattern language reflective of the many fields in which the Institute played, as well as its nimble entrepreneurial spirit. This approach created a system that could flex and evolve across different applications while maintaining brand coherence.

We implemented the new identity system across innumerable touchpoints ranging from page, to pixel, to space. Our work helped to reinforce the Institute's unique positioning as a social enterprise operating in a world that often only cares about the bottom line. Our efforts supported the Drucker Institute as they launched new programs both at home and abroad, helping introduce Drucker's timeless wisdom to new generations across the world.

### TESTIMONIAL

“Equipped with knowledge and collateral from the Kilter team, the Drucker Institute has raised millions of dollars, built sustainable lines of business and, ultimately, delivered on our mission for thousands of customers.”
