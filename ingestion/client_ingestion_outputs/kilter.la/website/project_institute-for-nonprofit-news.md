## CONTEXT

The Institute for Nonprofit News (INN) is a network of more than 150 newsrooms — nonprofit, nonpartisan, and dedicated to public service. INN provides education and business support services to their member organizations while promoting the value and benefit of public-service and investigative journalism.

## THE ASSIGNMENT

INN tasked Kilter with creating an approachable annual report that clearly explained the organization's impact and could live in both print and screen formats.

## OUR SOLUTION

By employing a vibrant and approachable visual language we were able to create a report that put the focus on INN’s story and functioned equally well across both print and digital platforms.
