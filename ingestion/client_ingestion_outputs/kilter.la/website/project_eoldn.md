# BRAND IDENTITY

Election Official Legal Defense Network

##### OVERVIEW﻿

We partnered with the Election Official Legal Defense Network to rethink their brand from the ground up and launch a refreshed web presence.

##### SERVICES

* Branding
* Positioning
* Web Design
* Print Collateral

##### CONTEXT

In recent years the simple idea that elections should be run on a professional, nonpartisan basis has come under attack in America. Many election officials have become targets of ire and intimidation and newly-passed laws seek to punish them for just doing their jobs. By recruiting lawyers across the country to provide a line of defense for these embattled officials, the Election Official Legal Defense Network (EOLDN) serves as an important corrective to these pernicious trends.

##### THE ASSIGNMENT

Kilter partnered with EOLDN to rebrand their organization and relaunch their website.

##### OUR SOLUTION

We worked closely with EOLDN’s leadership to develop a brand that not only clearly communicated who they are and what they do but also conveyed a sense of impartial trustworthiness. The timeless new visual identity draws inspiration from 1930s Works Progress Administration poster graphics with a logo that highlights the patriotic resolve of our nation's election officials. The end result is a compelling brand identity that proudly manifests EOLDN's mission to protect democracy and elevates their visibility and credibility.
