# ICD Programmer Interface

## OVERVIEW

Kilter partnered with Schmid Design & Strategy to develop an intuitive user interface for a new medical device from a global medtech company.

## SERVICES

* UI Design
* Information Graphics
* Prototyping
* Illustration

## CONTEXT

Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are small battery-powered devices placed in a patient's chest to detect and stop irregular heartbeats, known as arrhythmias. By continuously checking a patient's heartbeat and delivering electric shocks when needed, an ICD can restore a regular heart rhythm and prevent potentially fatal cardiac episodes.

## THE ASSIGNMENT

Kilter teamed up with Schmid Design & Strategy to develop a user interface for a new ICD programmer that would be clear and easy to use for doctors, technicians and other medical professionals.

## OUR SOLUTION

Working in a fast-paced iterative process, Kilter developed a design language that was both intuitive and streamlined but also sophisticated enough to accommodate a deep library of features and readouts all on a device with limited screen real estate.
