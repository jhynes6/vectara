### CONTEXT

Citizens of the World is a national network of charter schools that celebrate and reflect the full diversity of their communities. Their goal is to prepare students to succeed in an increasingly interconnected, global society and to help them fulfill their potential as global citizens.

### THE ASSIGNMENT

Citizens of the World tasked Kilter with launching an admission campaign that raised awareness of and interest in their Silverlake campus in Los Angeles.

### OUR SOLUTION

Through emphasizing the connection between high diversity and high achievement, we increased Citizens of the World's reach with a boldly designed campaign featuring an eye-catching contemporary illustration style and confident use of their signature green.

Kicking off the campaign with a billboard on Santa Monica Blvd, we ran targeted media placements that ran in multiple languages to create a seamless experience—all directing to a simple online signup form to help cultivate the diverse student body that makes the school so essential. Ultimately the campaign reached over 1,000,000 Los Angeles residents, garnered over 100 school tour signups, and increased engagement with the school’s social media platforms by 14x, all within a compressed timeframe.
