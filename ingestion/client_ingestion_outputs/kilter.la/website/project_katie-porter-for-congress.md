# CAMPAIGN

Katie Porter for Congress

##### OVERVIEW﻿

We partnered with OPRO by Open Progress, a digital media agency for progressive candidates and causes, to develop infographics and animations for Katie Porter’s 2018 congressional campaign.

##### SERVICES

* Motion Graphics
* Animation
* Illustration
* Infographics
* Concepting

The “Beaches” video was viewed in full more than 100,000 times on Facebook and Instagram alone.

##### CONTEXT

Running as a progressive Democrat in California’s 45th Congressional District, a longtime Republican stronghold, Porter faced an uphill battle.

> “The animation by Kilter allowed for a visceral connection to the question being posed by Katie: who do you trust to protect our Orange County jewel—our beaches and ocean front? In a race that was won by under 10,000 votes, this work mattered.”

##### THE ASSIGNMENT

Working on a tight timeline, we partnered with the team at OPRO to develop illustrations and motion graphics for a series of pivotal digital campaign ads.

##### OUR SOLUTION

By visualizing a clear and authentic narrative about the issues that mattered to Porter, we helped her to break through to a wider audience.

After a neck-and-neck race that lasted more than a week after the polls closed, Katie Porter won the 45th congressional district in Orange County, becoming the first Democrat to hold the seat.
