# WeHo: Community Safety and Well-Being

## OVERVIEW

We created a campaign to help the City of West Hollywood engage residents in the development of the city’s first-ever Community Safety and Well-Being Strategic Plan.

## SERVICES

* Graphic Design
* Illustration

## CONTEXT

The City of West Hollywood takes a progressive and proactive approach to public safety. Since its incorporation in 1984, the city has invested in a wide range of initiatives and relationships to ensure the health, safety, and well-being of the community. When it came time to develop a comprehensive Community Safety and Well-Being strategy for WeHo, the city knew that opening a dialogue with residents to solicit input would be a crucial part of the process.

## THE ASSIGNMENT

Kilter was tasked with creating an approachable and friendly campaign voice for the city’s CSWB efforts in order to engage local residents in the planning process.

## OUR SOLUTION

We centered our approach on a layered and vibrant illustration of the community to create a flexible brand kit designed to engage WeHo residents in this important planning process.

Elements from the master illustration we created were then remixed to create targeted assets focused on specific areas within the plan like Public Safety and Homeless Outreach. Finally, we applied the visual system to a wide spectrum of physical and digital touchpoints to create a campaign that engaged the public by enlivening what is often a dry and abstract policy discussion.
