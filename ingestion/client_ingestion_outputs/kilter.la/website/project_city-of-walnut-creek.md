# BRAND IDENTITY

## City of Walnut Creek

##### OVERVIEW﻿
Kilter partnered with the City of Walnut Creek to refresh and modernize its graphic identity.

##### SERVICES
* Branding
* Illustration
* Art Direction

##### CONTEXT
Just outside San Francisco, Walnut Creek offers quick and easy access to the excitement of a vibrant city and the charm of hometown California, all in one central location. In a sunny, upscale and comfortable environment, at the base of Mt. Diablo, the city brings together an eclectic collection of culture, award-winning shopping, hotels, sports facilities and cuisine.

##### THE ASSIGNMENT
Walnut Creek tasked Kilter with redesigning their logo and identity system to better serve contemporary needs.

##### OUR SOLUTION
Although recognizable to the community, Walnut Creek's existing logo was hampered by a degree of detail that made it hard to reproduce in all the necessary mediums and at small sizes. We began our efforts by giving their iconic tree a dynamic streamlined new look. The new rendering maintained the equity of the existing illustration while making it much more practical to use.

Prioritizing accessibility, we also updated the city's color and typographic palettes giving them a more focused contemporary feel that spoke to all residents. From its online presence to signage and community events, the City of Walnut Creek can now engage with its citizens freshly and authentically.
