### CONTEXT

Pasadena Unified School District is a system of over two dozen K–12 public schools, serving over 15,000 students. The district includes neighborhood schools, specialty schools, and magnet school programs.

Pasadena is also home to more private schools per capita than any city in the United States. This competitive educational landscape meant that many of PUSD's amazing magnet school programs were underrecognized in the community.

### THE ASSIGNMENT

Kilter was tasked with creating a multi-school marketing campaign to raise awareness of and interest in three of PUSD's newest magnet school programs.

### OUR SOLUTION

Because each of the three featured schools offered a variety of different specialized programs, it was often difficult for prospective families to understand what the overarching philosophy of each school was. We developed a messaging system that clarified each school's unique differentiator while playfully highlighting their most exciting offerings with a vibrant sticker-like visual system.

The messaging for the individual schools was united under the headline "Discover the best education money can't buy" driving home the fact that exceptional educational experiences are available within Pasadena's public school system.

To reach our local audience we ran digital ads on community websites, canvased the neighborhood with door hangers, ran print ads supported by editorial in local papers, ran targeted e-blasts, and created brochures to help the schools share their story with interested families. The end result? A surge in interest in the featured schools and an increase in enrollment.
