# OneLegacy

## OVERVIEW

Kilter partnered with Fiona Hutton & Associates to create a refreshed brand presentation for the organ donation nonprofit OneLegacy tailored to increase their visibility and reputation among physicians, political leaders, and possible donors.

## SERVICES

* Website Design
* Collateral Design
* Email Design

## CONTEXT

OneLegacy is a nonprofit organization dedicated to saving lives through organ, eye, and tissue donation in the seven-county greater Los Angeles area. With more than 215 hospitals, 11 transplant centers, and a diverse population of nearly 20 million, OneLegacy is the largest organ, eye, and tissue recovery organization in the world.

## THE ASSIGNMENT

Kilter was tasked with completely redesigning OneLegacy's digital communication tools, from their website, to their email templates, to their fact sheets.

## OUR SOLUTION

The centerpiece of our efforts was a redesigned website which reorganized and streamlined a voluminous amount of information aimed at several distinct stakeholder groups. The new site features a user-friendly structure and automatic translation options to provide easy access to a diverse community of donors and recipients. To support the new site we also created a digital communication strategy to keep constituents informed and engaged through email newsletters and targeted fact sheets.

Our new brand presentation allows OneLegacy to have a professional, unified presentation while tailoring its message to its diverse audience of stakeholders.
