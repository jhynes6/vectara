# Get Your Ass Out and Vote

##### OVERVIEW﻿

In the lead up to the November 2018 midterms, Kilter partnered with Open Progress, a nonprofit whose work is focused on defying the hold of big money on government, to create social media content that energized voters and drove turnout on election day.

##### CONTEXT

After two years of the Trump administration, 2018 represented a pivotal moment in America's political trajectory. Would the MAGA movement deepen its hold on our country's political system or would voters repudiate Trumpism at the ballot box?

In order to shift the political momentum, one thing was clear: Democrats would need to assemble a broad coalition of engaged voters and motivate them to come out in droves on election day.

##### RESULTS

8 million

ad impressions

305,000

completed views

100,000

visits to commit.showupto.vote

##### THE ASSIGNMENT

Kilter was tasked with creating a series of Get Our the Vote ads for social media to drive excitement among Democratic voters in the 2018 midterm elections.

##### OUR SOLUTION

We crafted a series of videos featuring Black-ish star Jenifer Lewis, designing and creating animations to cut her performance into a hilarious spot run nationally by Knock the Vote, Commit to Vote, and Open Progress. The videos went viral, getting attention and shares by prominent figures and celebrities like Chelsea Handler. With more than 8 million ad impressions, 305,000 completed views, and 100,000 visits to commit.showupto.vote, her ad was the best performing piece of get-out-the-vote content that Commit to Vote’s national program ran.
