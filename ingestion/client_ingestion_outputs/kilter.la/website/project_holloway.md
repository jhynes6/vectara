## CONTEXT

In 2022, the City of West Hollywood acquired the Holloway Motel with a plan to convert the mid-century landmark into an interim housing facility. Operated by Ascencia—one of the city's nonprofit social services partners—the Holloway would provide comprehensive services and a supportive space for people experiencing homelessness to transition into stable housing.

## THE ASSIGNMENT

West Hollywood tasked the Kilter team with developing a brand and messaging system for the new facility to help frame the city's communications about the Holloway to their residents.

## OUR SOLUTION

From our earliest conversations with the city, it was clear that the brand for the Holloway needed to feel uplifting and accessible without minimizing the seriousness of the issues the facility was intended to address.

Referencing the iconic location, we built out an illustrated identity system that reflected the optimism of travel ads and the visual vernacular of mid-century motel ephemera. Our messaging struck a similarly affirmative note, focusing on the Holloway's role as a gateway for unlocking a brighter future for those experiencing homelessness.
