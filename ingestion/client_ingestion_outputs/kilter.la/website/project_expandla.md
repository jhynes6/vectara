# BRAND IDENTITY

## OVERVIEW

Kilter crafted a vibrant and extensible brand identity and website for education nonprofit ExpandLA.

## SERVICES

*   Logo Design
*   Branding
*   Web Design

## CONTEXT

Launched in 2022, ExpandLA was founded with the goal of supporting and advocating for Los Angeles youth and local after-school & expanded learning providers. The nonprofit’s mission: to ensure that all students have the opportunity to participate in high-quality programs that will help prepare them for a bright future.

## THE ASSIGNMENT

Kilter partnered with ExpandLA to build a brand that celebrated the organization’s work unifying these partner organizations.

## OUR SOLUTION

We created a logo made of building blocks, referencing both elementary education and the vibrant network of area nonprofits that ExpandLA works with. A bold color palette and a flexible and extensible visual language create a robust digital-first identity system ideally suited to telling ExpandLA’s story and reaching potential donors, supporters, and policy-makers. Finally, we crafted a streamlined and engaging website for ExpandLA that housed a wealth of resources and information in an intuitive user-friendly design.
