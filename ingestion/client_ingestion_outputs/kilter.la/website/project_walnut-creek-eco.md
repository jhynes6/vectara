# BRAND IDENTITY

## Walnut Creek E.C.O.

### OVERVIEW﻿

Kilter worked with the City of Walnut Creek to develop an inclusive and welcoming umbrella brand for their environmental initiatives.

### SERVICES

* Naming
* Concepting
* Art Direction
* Branding
* Copywriting

### CONTEXT

The city leaders of Walnut Creek sought a new way to talk about climate change. A leader in sustainability, Walnut Creek took the opportunity to publicize and popularize critical initiatives designed to improve the local economy, environment and public health. As the government’s language often colors perception and shapes attitudes around climate issues, Walnut Creek felt a responsibility to communicate clearly and effectively in the fight against global warming.

### THE ASSIGNMENT

With a topic that’s both polarizing and urgent, it’s essential the branding and language are chosen with care. We teamed up with Walnut Creek to bring a lightness and innovation to the presentation of sustainability-related topics.

### OUR SOLUTION

We steered away from politicized labels and “green” shorthands, in favor of the adaptable acronym E.C.O. As an umbrella brand, Walnut Creek’s E.C.O. promotes essential initiatives across many different departments. From E.C.O.mmuting with public transit to conserving water, the new Walnut Creek brand identity flexed to support all new website copywriting, printed brochures, and program fliers. The result is a bright and inviting brand identity designed to reach residents across the city (and the aisle).
