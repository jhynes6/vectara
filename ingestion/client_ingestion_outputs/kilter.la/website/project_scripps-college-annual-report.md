##### CONTEXT

Founded in 1926, Scripps College stands as an internationally recognized leader in women’s liberal arts education. While the college’s impact on developing future leaders through academic excellence and community engagement was clear, their annual report needed to evolve beyond traditional formats to better engage their diverse audience of students, faculty, staff, trustees, alums, and donors.

The college sought to transform their annual reporting from a conventional document into a dynamic digital experience that would authentically showcase their vibrant community and institutional achievements.

##### THE ASSIGNMENT

Scripps tasked Kilter with creating an innovative microsite that would expand access to their story of academic excellence and institutional strength, while providing an engaging user experience built on their existing WordPress infrastructure. The solution needed to seamlessly integrate with their brand guidelines while incorporating data visualizations and multimedia content.

##### OUR SOLUTION

We designed a single-page microsite that transforms institutional data into a compelling visual narrative. The architecture follows a storytelling approach, using a combination of scrolling interactions, dynamic data presentations, and multimedia elements to create an immersive experience that brings Scripps' achievements to life.

The design system we developed ensures that complex data remains accessible and engaging, using bold infographics to highlight key metrics about the college’s operations and impact. We integrated video and audio elements throughout the experience to showcase the authentic voices of the Scripps community.

Critically, we built the site as a reusable template within their WordPress CMS, allowing the school’s internal team to easily update content for future annual reports while maintaining design consistency. The resulting microsite successfully bridges the gap between conventional reporting and digital storytelling, creating an experience that resonates deeply with the Scripps community while effectively communicating the college's achievements and vision for the future.
