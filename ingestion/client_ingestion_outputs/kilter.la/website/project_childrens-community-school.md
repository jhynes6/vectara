## CONTEXT

Children’s Community School was designed to invite the neighborhood in, ensuring it remains one of the most diverse independent schools in Los Angeles. Their progressive curriculum is built around active learning—free from the limitations of tests, textbooks, or grades.

## THE ASSIGNMENT

To celebrate their unconventional approach to education, we developed a series of provocative message-driven admission touchpoints to challenge the tenets of traditional education across videos, social media, and printed materials.

## OUR SOLUTION

Communicating how CCS's educational philosophy translates into the classroom had sometimes been tricky for the school. We anchored our approach on highlighting how the school's pedagogy manifests itself in practical terms. Using direct language and playful visuals we built a campaign that underscored CCS's bold curriculum while simultaneously taking the mystery out of progressive education.

First we highlighted each key offering of the school, working quickly from concept to completion to create a series of short videos as well as a longer fundraising narrative. The admissions materials ran across local media outlets, public radio, and social media. From there we completely reimagined the school’s admission collateral from their viewbook to a new comprehensive educational roadmap that broke down CCS's curriculum by subject matter and age, clearly elucidating what their rigorous approach to progressive education looks like.
