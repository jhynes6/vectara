CLEAR

SPACE & SIZING

Clear space is the area surrounding our logo that must be kept free of any text or graphic elements. By
leaving space around the logo, we make sure it stands out in all of our communications. The minimum clear
space is 50% of the height of the entire logo. Our logo must be sized large enough to be easily read on every
application.
