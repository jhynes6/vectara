* Elevate Your Law Firm's Credibility with Expert Public Relations
* Get More Clients Through Public Relations & Media Exposure

Hi [Law Firm/Associate],

We’re blushing.

“In short, their work for me has been outstanding and sometimes bordering on miraculous.” - Jack Garson, Lawyer and Strategic Advisor

That’s just one of the kind comments we’ve received from law firms after we raised their profile in the media, boosting their credibility in ways traditional advertising simply can’t match.

You have lots of competitors. Other law firms are vying for the same clients who might actually prefer YOU as their lawyer.

We make sure those clients can find YOU when they need YOU!

We helped Garson Law and other prominent DC law firms become nationally recognized thought leaders by securing prestigious awards and coverage in top-tier publications like The New York Times, NBC Nightly News, Forbes, or on local news outlets.

At On The Marc Media, we specialize in public relations that positions you as an expert source in local, regional, or national media. Here’s how we do it:

* **Identify Your Expertise:** We pinpoint your areas of expertise and craft compelling narratives that highlight your strengths.
* **Media Placement:** We secure placements for you in reputable news outlets, establishing you as a trusted authority in your field.
* **Amplify Your Presence:** We help you share these stories through your social media channels, email marketing, and website. When people see you featured as the expert the news relies on, it significantly boosts your credibility.

So…

Ready to elevate your firm’s credibility and get more clients?

Dear [Law Firm Partner/Marketing Director],

At On The Marc Media, we specialize in strategic public relations for the legal sector, helping firms like yours gain influential exposure in local, regional, and national news outlets -- ultimately getting you more clients. While advertising is a valuable tool for brand visibility, incorporating public relations can elevate your firm’s authority and trustworthiness in a way that traditional ads simply cannot.

Media coverage acts as a third-party endorsement, providing your firm with the credibility that comes from being featured in respected publications and broadcasts. This not only enhances your firm's stature but also deeply resonates with potential clients who are often influenced by the authoritative voice of the media.

We would love the opportunity to meet with you and discuss how we can bring this added dimension to your firm’s marketing strategy. Our tailored approach means we identify and highlight the unique aspects of your practice, positioning you as thought leaders and experts in your field, which in turn, attracts more informed and engaged clients.

Could we schedule a brief meeting to explore how a targeted public relations strategy could benefit [Law Firm Name]?

Thank you for considering this opportunity to distinguish [Law Firm Name] from the competition. I am excited about the possibility of working together to showcase the excellent work you do.
