CASE STUDY GARSON LAW

CLIENT AT A GLANCE

Garson Law was a long-term On The Marc Media client who
sought assistance in raising and maintaining awareness of
his practice, as well as in becoming a nationally known
thought leader with unparalleled expertise in commercial
real estate, construction, and business law.

CHALLENGES

Attorney Jack Garson sought PR and marketing counsel to
help him stand out in the fast-paced, hard-charging panoply
of law firms and legal stars in the Washington, D.C., region. A
savvy real estate, construction- and business-contract
expert — he has drafted and negotiated over $2 billion in
construction contracts, including contracts for the
development of apartment, condominium, hotel and golf
course projects — Garson wanted to attract a more elite
level of clientele to his firm. He was also a gifted
communicator but needed editorial and media guidance to
channel his talents into content that would be seen by
prospective clients.

SOLUTIONS

On The Marc Media president, Marc Silverstein secured a publishing deal (with St. Martin’s
Press) for the book How to Build a Business and Sell It for Millions.
OTMM helped Garson earn article placements and awards year after year, including:
Interviews and profiles in The New York Times, The Washington Post, Bloomberg
Businessweek and the Washington Business Journal
TV coverage on WUSA9, ABC 7, ABC 2 Baltimore, News Channel 8, and First Business.
OTMM arranged contributor positions for Garson in targeted publications to help him build
thought leadership and reputational awareness. OTMM assisted with brainstorming column
topics, as well as reviewing and editing his pieces in:

High-profile national outlets Forbes and Huffington Post
A monthly law column called The Legal Edge for SmartCEO (a leading business magazine
in the D.C. region that has since ceased publication)
