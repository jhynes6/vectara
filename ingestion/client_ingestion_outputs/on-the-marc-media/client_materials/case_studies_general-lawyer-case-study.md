LEGAL CASE STUDY

CLIENT AT A GLANCE

A full-service law firm, including business;
commercial litigation; construction; criminal;
employment; estates, trusts and probate; family;
personal injury; real estate; and tax law. It targets a
broad variety of audiences that need legal
assistance, from accident victims to criminal
defendants, businesses with complex commercial
disputes to families seeking wills and real estate
contracts, and more.

CHALLENGES

PUBLIC RELATIONS GOAL

The firm sought public relations assistance to
help them stand out from their competition in the
Washington, D.C. region.

The Washington, D.C region ranks #2 — after the NYC area — for the most lawyers of any U.S.
metropolitan area, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. (The DCBar alone reports having
“more than 111,000 members in all 50 states and over 80 countries and territories.”) With all that
competition, the law firm wants to increase its name recognition and positive reputation among potential
clients.

RESULTS

On The Marc Media is attracting extensive
coverage for the firm in targeted media outlets.
Since beginning our work, OTMM pitched an
array of stories to high-profile DMV news outlets,
successfully garnering placements in numerous
outlets.
