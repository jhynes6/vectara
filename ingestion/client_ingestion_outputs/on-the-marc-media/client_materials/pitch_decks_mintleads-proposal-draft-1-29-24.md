HOW WE WORK

Working with us is easy. We use a three-step process to get started.

STEP 1:  TARGETED ONBOARDING AND INTEGRATION
We  start  with  a  deep  dive  into  your  business  to  understand
your  primary  audiences,  key  objectives,  and  target  media
outlets. In this onboarding session, we assess your marketing
needs, brainstorm potential story ideas, and identify how we
can bridge any additional marketing gaps. We ensure our PR
strategies align seamlessly with your internal and/or existing
marketing  vendors  and  integrate  seamlessly  for  a  cohesive
and cost-effective impact.

STEP 2: CUSTOMIZED PR AND MARKETING STRATEGY
We  craft  a  PR  strategy  that  not  only  amplifies  your  media
presence  but  also  aligns  with  and  enhances  your  current
marketing activities for an integrated approach.

STEP 3: COLLABORATIVE PLAN IMPLEMENTATION
We present our tailored plan to you, refining it based on your
feedback. Following this, we implement the strategy, closely
monitoring  key  metrics  to  ensure  we're  meeting  your  goals.
We  make  adjustments  as  needed,  ensuring  your  success
every step of the way.

Marketing and public relations can be complicated. But working with On The
Marc Media is simple. We’re laser-focused on helping you succeed.

WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT

We’ll want to know your priorities, what success looks like to you, your
mission & values, who on your team will be involved in decisions and
approvals, and what’s worked or hasn’t worked for you in the past.

We’ll also ask a lot of questions about the people who make up your
audiences. What makes them tick? What are their hopes, aspirations,
fears, challenges? What’s truly important to them?

We work with you to unlock the emotionally powerful stories buried in
your organization.

We see things you might not see. We spot story opportunities you
might not consider.

Then, we decide how to tell your stories in ways that move people to
take the actions you want.

We engage with your audience to build a relationship, a bond of trust, a
shared sense of caring.

And we stay tuned in and flexible, so we can quickly see what’s working
and what’s not...then nimbly change if needed.

MORE ABOUT US

We’re former TV reporters turned PR pros.

We started On The Marc Media after leaving our TV careers because we saw
that companies and nonprofits were having a tough time telling their stories
effectively.
