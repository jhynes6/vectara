CLIENT OVERVIEW

American Gene Technologies® (AGT™) founder and CEO Jeff Galvin launched the company as a
startup in 2008. Galvin had been retired from a career in Silicon Valley as a software entrepreneur
and angel investor, when a 2007 meeting with acclaimed National Institutes of Health researcher
Roscoe Brady, MD, PhD, showed him the power of lentivirus vectors to edit genes. That revelation
drove Galvin to form AGT to pursue potential gene therapy cures for diseases like HIV, PKU and
certain cancers.

On The Marc Media was integral to AGT’s marketing and PR efforts. After a successful Phase I human
trial of AGT103-T (the company’s gene therapy for HIV), On The Marc Media helped AGT prepare for a
corporate transformation that may result in a public company, to be called Addimmune™, which
would focus on further developing the HIV gene therapy program, while AGT would work on gene
therapies for other diseases.

CHALLENGES

The company needed comprehensive planning and execution of:

Branding & messaging
Website design
Public relations
Content marketing
Search engine optimization
Social media
Video series called The Cure Chronicles
Explainer videos on a variety of topics
Internal marketing team development and leadership

CASE STUDY AGT & ADDIMMUNE

In particular, one of our recurring challenges involved the need to translate highly technical and
scientific information into content tailored to specific audiences. AGT sought to engage with a
variety of stakeholders, from HIV activists to investors to scientists to government regulators to the
general public.

Because gene therapy is both new to many people and controversial to some, we had to help AGT
be both proactive in educating audiences as well as reactive in addressing misinformation,
misconceptions and questions that arose especially in social media and online forums.

SOLUTIONS

We designed and executed a sustained, comprehensive, integrated, multimedia communications
strategy to achieve the companies’ goals.

Branding & Messaging: On The Marc Media did extensive work for both companies to clarify
and build out their branding and messaging.

For AGT, this included: staff bios, message house, FAQs, knowledge base, elevator pitches,
mission statement, vision statement, values statement, key messages, detractor
messaging, stakeholder messaging, website copy, fact sheets, one-pager clinical trial
messaging, and PowerPoints.
For Addimmune, this included: staff bios, message house, FAQs, key messages, website
copy, knowledge base, PowerPoints, elevator pitches, mission statement, vision statement,
values statement, and apparel design & printing.

High-Value Earned Media: We pitched and secured media coverage in targeted outlets,
resulting in more than 90 media hits from January 2022 – January 2024.

Contributor Articles: We positioned CEO Jeff Galvin not only as a thought leader in the pursuit
of a cure for HIV and other diseases, but also as a biotech business leader in Maryland and
beyond. We successfully wrote and placed bylined features for him in targeted publications.

Awards & Recognition: We researched and submitted CEO Jeff Galvin and AGT itself for
prestigious awards. These awards garnered additional media attention for Galvin and for AGT.

AGT was awarded the 2023 Gold Globee® Disruptor Award.
Galvin received the Life Sciences Voice Top Industry Leaders Award, recognizing the most
dynamic leaders in the life sciences industry.
AGT won the Biobuzz Media Award for The Cure Chronicles video series.
AGT won NABOE World Changing Business Award.
AGT was recognized in the 2023 issue of Bethesda Magazine's Best Places to Work Award
for having the happiest employees in the Bethesda area according to research by Best
Companies Group.

by meticulously managing the logistics of guest scheduling, scriptwriting, and filming,
followed by rigorous post-production editing, and strategically deployed promotion efforts
to ensure maximum visibility and impact in the target audience.

Website Development: We did extensive work on both the AGT and Addimmune websites.

For AGT: Redesigned and optimized the site, wrote web copy and FAQs, and updated the
knowledge base. As a result of our work, AGT had a 14.5% increase in website views in 2022

Collateral Materials:

For AGT: Developed strategic messaging, fact sheets, news releases, FAQs, emails, letters,

Event Marketing: Planned and coordinated a successful launch party at which plans for
Addimmune were unveiled, including coordinating closely with Montgomery County Council
members on a resolution proclaiming the county “DNA Valley” — a name Galvin helped coin
and amplify into more common usage to spread awareness of the region’s biotech leadership.

Public Relations Approach

On The Marc Media tailored earned-media outreach to audience-specific outlets, which each
viewed the HIV epidemic through a different lens: scientific, medical, social, policy, business,
personal and more.

We pitched stories leading up to, through and following the Phase I clinical trial of AGT103-T. We
spotlighted the leadership team, particularly CEO Jeff Galvin. We teased upcoming developments.
And we trumpeted each success and achievement, which helped the company balance its legal
mandates with its desire to instill realistic hope in people living with HIV.
