 Free onboarding - Onboarding unusually takes a two week period before you can get started.  It’s usually 10 - 15 hours or up to $3K of the budget. So maybe we give them a half a month free or something?

Service Differentiation

What makes you different from your competitors? What is your “special sauce”?
 ● We are former reporters so we know how the media works - what they will and won’t respond to, whereas other firms don’t have the experience of working in newsrooms, which means we have a higher success rate
 because we speak their language.We offer “Nordstrom” customer service.
 ● We are partners. We get to know their business and we make sure our services are perfectly aligned with their business objectives.
 ● We are much more responsive than most agencies so clients feel like we have their back.

Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? What do you do to improve their business?
 Customer problems:
 ● I need more business/more clients/more sales/more appointments booked
 ● I need to stand out from the competition
 ● I need investors to increase cash flow and revenue
 ● I need more exposure so people know about my brand
 ● I need legislation passed or to put pressure on certain politicians to meet my government affairs goals, policy change
 ● I need to get public acceptance of legislation/an advocacy campaign
 ● I want to further a message in the media to gain a following for my cause, to secure me recognition that will get me on a specific board, or to position me as a thought leader in my industry
 ● I need to get a lot of coverage around the launch of my new offering or the opening of a new center
 To improve their business OTMM:
 ● Secures our clients positive media coverage to achieve those goals. For example, we get a local plastic surgeon on local news talking about the effects of “digital aging” and tips/procedures that help, and then they see
 an uptick in appointments. Or we get the media to attend the opening event for a new adult high school which increases their chance at getting funding from federal/state grants and public donors. Or we secure executive media interviews and thought leadership opportunities to work toward the goal of having him win a specific award or land a spot on a prestigious board. Or we get a biotech company in the news for its innovative technologies, targeting publications that investors read and they see an increase in investments.
