# How To Gain Tremendous Insights Through Brand Localization

We often talk about the need for brands to be "local."

Marketers – have you ever imagined what localizing your efforts can teach you?

Here’s an example to help you envision the benefits:

AARP is best known for the savings they deliver to senior citizens. But they are much more than that. They offer resources across categories like insurance, travel, health, family caregiving, and more. They want to be an everyday resource for their members.

![Longitude73 Blog How To Gain Tremendous Insight Through Brand Localization](https://www.longitude73.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-08-09%20at%202.28.48%20PM.png?width=284&name=Screen%20Shot%202019-08-09%20at%202.28.48%20PM.png)

They’ve versioned their website to have a [customized local presence](https://local.aarp.org/) for every city and town in the US. This means no matter where their members are, they have all the resources they need in their _local_ area. Members can access contextualized content on local restaurants, things to do, and events.  

The idea is to make AARP a valuable resource to their membership on a continual basis vs. once or twice a year.

Think about all that AARP could learn from their members in this case. They can now understand exactly what members in specific communities care about most.

This knowledge can help power their advertising, promotions, media spending, and sponsorships.

With [Brand Localization](/blog/the-virtuous-circle-of-brand-localization), you can be the useful resource your audience wants and needs. In turn, you will gain consumer insight and improve ROI of your efforts.
