# Nextdoor: Is the Social Network for Neighborhoods an Opportunity?

We often discuss the great advertising opportunity that comes from Nextdoor. So, what exactly is it?

[Nextdoor](https://nextdoor.com/) is a social networking service for neighborhoods. It allows neighbors to connect and share recommendations, find local handymen, or warn about a wild animal in the community!

Other social networking sites connect users with friends and family around the world. Nextdoor connects people living in the same neighborhood as one another.

This creates an incredible opportunity for marketers.

There are roughly 190,000 neighborhoods on Nextdoor that cover 90% of the country. With Nextdoor, marketers have the potential to target at a town, neighborhood, or **street** level!

How’s _that_ for granular marketing?

Well, it's not _that_ simple!

The platform does have some limitations, especially for large scale brands.
