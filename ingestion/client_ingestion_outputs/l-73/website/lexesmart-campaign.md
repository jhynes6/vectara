# Optimize Post-Click Performance By Driving High Local Relevance

We all know that **locally relevant ads perform as much as 200% better than national ads** but they require more effort.

Yet still, **only about 4% of people click your ad. Of those who do, more than 96% don’t convert.** That’s painful especially in a PPC campaign.

While there’s certainly room for improvement in the ads themselves, post-click experience has lagged behind significantly.

After all, **the ad doesn’t do the selling.** It’s only the bait on the hook.

**It’s the landing page that sells.** It’s the fishing pole that reels in your customers and gets them to convert.

## The post-click experience defined:

Everything that impacts whether a click becomes a conversion. These are things like visual and message match, relevance, load time, and the like.
