# Campaign-Local: Driving Results for Ads and Emails at Scale

With location targeting in advertising being so prevalent these days, for marketers who are delivering hyperlocal ads, are you putting equal effort into your landing pages?

We know it may seem unscalable to do so, that’s why we’ve created Campaign-Local landing pages.

Hyperlocal landing pages will dramatically improve the post-click experience and the results of your advertising and email campaigns.

Here’s how:

1. Optimize your ad shell to be a location-relevant template
2. Select specific towns or neighborhoods for the campaign
3. Deliver a post-click landing page that maintains the location relevance in headline, body content, and finally, the lead/conversion action

With hyperlocal landing pages, when someone clicks on your ad, they'll land on a page that works to accomplish your goal, but more importantly, bridges the local relevance all the way _through_ to that goal.

Here’s an example of how it can work:

AARP sends an email to its nearly 38 million members talking about things to do during the upcoming Fall season. Because they know the zip code of a particular member, it adds “…In Washington D.C.”

A crucial piece of the equation happens next: when the member clicks, they don’t land on a national “Fall is in the Air” page for the entire US; they land on a Washington D.C.-specific page, populated with numerous ways to enjoy the season _in that specific area_.  The difference between these two experiences is dramatic. Consider the increased relevance and actionability of town-specific version vs. the national versions. Now imagine this taking place in any or all 29,000+ cities and towns across all of your initiatives throughout the year.

Smart, local landing pages deliver the _most engaging experience._ Thanks to our Local Content Optimization platform, marketing personalization to cities, towns, or even neighborhoods, at every geographic level is both _scalable_ and _efficient_.
