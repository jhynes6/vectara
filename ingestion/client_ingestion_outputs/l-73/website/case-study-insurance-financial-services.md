# Insurance & Financial Services

### Problem

#### How can an internet insurance and financial services company compete against a competitor with local agents in a way that fosters trust in the consumer audience?

* The brand wanted to build a virtual community presence but couldn’t, as a national brand, justify the expense of building at town level presence let alone the cost of keeping it current.
* Wordpress blogs at the state level were already hard to maintain and keep fresh.

### Solution

#### Merging brand content & resources with our sourced content created a locally relevant and approachable experience.

* Starting with state level approach, we quickly progressed to town level in high-focus portions of the country
* Utilizing educational content, tools & resources and blog articles combined with local wellness and seasonal events across all US Towns, created an enhanced user experience. Adding unique content channels, segmented and tailored to their audience in areas such as health, auto, homeowner allowed for the experience to be made most relevant to the visitor audience.
