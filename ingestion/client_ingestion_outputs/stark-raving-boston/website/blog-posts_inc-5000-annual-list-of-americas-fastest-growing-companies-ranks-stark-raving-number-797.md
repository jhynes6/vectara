**BOSTON** – Today, Inc. announced that Stark / Raving Branding + Digital Marketing is No. 797 on its annual [Inc. 5000 list](http://www.inc.com/inc5000), the most prestigious ranking of the fastest-growing, privately-owned companies in America. The list includes some of the most successful companies within the economy’s most dynamic segment – its independent businesses. Facebook, Chobani, Under Armour, Microsoft, Patagonia, and many other well-known names gained their first national exposure as honorees on the Inc. 5000.

“As a first-time member of the Inc. 5000, we are thrilled to be ranked at No. 797,” said Matthew Stumm, Founder and President. “Achieving this honor is a testament to our dedicated team and clients – it’s especially important in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting complications.

The companies on the 2022 Inc. 5000 have not only been successful, but have also demonstrated resilience amid supply chain woes, labor shortages, and the ongoing impact of Covid-19.

**Methodology:** Companies on the [2022 Inc. 5000](http://www.inc.com/inc5000) are ranked according to percentage revenue growth from 2018 to 2021. To qualify, companies must have been founded and generating revenue by March 31, 2018.
