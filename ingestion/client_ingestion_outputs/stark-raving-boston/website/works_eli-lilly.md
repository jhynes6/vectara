### Over a million Americans with diabetes were being hospitalized annually because they were rationing life-saving insulin due to crushing out-of-pocket costs. Families were choosing between insulin and rent, between medication and food, while pharmaceutical companies reported record profits. The human cost was devastating, but patients felt powerless against a system that seemed designed to extract maximum profit from their desperation.

### We launched the Affordable Insulin Project to transform diabetes patients from passive victims into powerful advocates for change. Working with Eli Lilly and the Diabetes Patient Advocacy Coalition, we created a campaign that didn’t just ask for help – it taught patients how to demand it. Our educational materials showed people exactly how to negotiate with insurance companies, access patient assistance programs, and advocate for policy changes that would benefit the entire diabetes community.

### The campaign empowered patients with knowledge, tools, and collective voice that ultimately contributed to systemic change. The result: a groundswell of patient advocacy that helped pave the way for Eli Lilly’s historic $35 insulin pledge, proving that when patients unite and speak up, even the most entrenched systems can be forced to change.

### The Affordable Insulin Project campaign achieved exceptional reach with over 2.2 million impressions in one month while driving meaningful engagement through over 9K website sessions and a strong 16.40% conversion rate that generated 2,428 total conversions. Facebook emerged as the standout performer with a 1.49% click-through rate and the highest engagement levels, while the “No Insurance” page proved remarkably effective, capturing nearly 80% of all conversions and demonstrating the campaign’s success in reaching its target audience of uninsured diabetes patients seeking affordable insulin access.
