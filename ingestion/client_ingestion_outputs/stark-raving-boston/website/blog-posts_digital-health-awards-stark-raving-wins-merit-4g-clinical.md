# Digital Health Awards Presents Stark / Raving with an Award for 4G Clinical’s Website Design

**BOSTON –** The Digital Health Awards announced today that Stark / Raving Branding + Digital Marketing was awarded MERIT for creative excellence for the 4G Clinical corporate website, recognizing the agency's ability to transform complex clinical research technology into compelling digital experiences that resonate with healthcare professionals and drive meaningful engagement. This prestigious recognition validates Stark / Raving's specialized expertise in healthcare marketing, where the challenge lies in making sophisticated medical technologies accessible and compelling to busy clinical decision-makers who need to quickly understand value propositions.

The award-winning 4G Clinical website exemplifies Stark / Raving's approach to healthcare digital marketing—taking inherently complex clinical trial management software and presenting it through clear, user-focused design that immediately communicates value to pharmaceutical companies, contract research organizations, and clinical investigators. The site successfully balances the need for comprehensive technical information with intuitive navigation and compelling visual design, creating a digital experience that educates prospects while guiding them toward conversion.

Entries in the Spring 2019 Digital Health Awards underwent rigorous evaluation by a distinguished panel of judges comprising healthcare marketing experts, digital design professionals, and medical industry leaders. Using a comprehensive rating scale of 1 to 100, each judge evaluated submissions across multiple criteria including content quality, design innovation, user experience optimization, and effectiveness in communicating complex healthcare information to target audiences.

"We are honored to receive this recognition for our work on 4G Clinical's corporate website," said Matthew Stumm, Founder of Stark / Raving. "Healthcare marketing presents unique challenges—our clients need to communicate sophisticated technical capabilities while building trust with highly educated, skeptical audiences who are focused on patient outcomes and regulatory compliance. This award validates our team's ability to create digital experiences that don't just inform, but actually help healthcare professionals make better decisions for their organizations and patients."

The recognition reflects the collaborative effort between Stark / Raving's design and development teams and 4G Clinical's marketing department, demonstrating how strategic partnerships between agencies and clients can produce exceptional results in the competitive healthcare technology market. The project required deep understanding of clinical trial processes, regulatory requirements, and the decision-making criteria of various stakeholders within pharmaceutical and biotech organizations.

The Digital Health Awards' rigorous judging process established award curves for each entry classification and category, with Gold, Silver, Bronze, and Merit awards going to the highest-scoring entries within their respective categories based on statistical curves. This methodology ensures that awards recognize true excellence rather than participation, with some categories receiving no awards if entries failed to meet established quality benchmarks.

This recognition adds to Stark / Raving's growing portfolio of healthcare marketing successes, including their Gold AVA Digital Award for the Affordable Insulin Project, demonstrating the agency's consistent ability to create marketing campaigns and digital experiences that serve both business objectives and meaningful healthcare outcomes. The award reinforces the agency's positioning as a specialist in transforming complex healthcare technologies into clear, compelling marketing messages that drive real business results.
