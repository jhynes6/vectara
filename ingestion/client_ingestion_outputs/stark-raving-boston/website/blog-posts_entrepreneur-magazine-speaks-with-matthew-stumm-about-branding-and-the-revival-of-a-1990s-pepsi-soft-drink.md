# Entrepreneur Magazine Speaks with Matthew Stumm about Branding and the Revival of a 1990âs Pepsi Soft Drink

In the January issue of [Entrepreneur Magazine](https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/remember-slice-soda-its-back-but-very-different/325929), Stark / Raving Branding + Digital Marketing Founder Matthew Stumm provides expert analysis on one of the most intriguing brand revival stories of the year, examining PepsiCo's bold decision to resurrect the iconic Slice soda brand with a dramatically different positioning strategy. The article explores the complex challenge of leveraging nostalgic brand equity while completely reimagining a product for today's health-conscious marketplace—a branding gamble that could either capitalize on powerful emotional connections or confuse consumers who remember the original sugary formula.

Stumm's commentary delves into the strategic marketing considerations behind reviving dormant brands, particularly when the new product bears little resemblance to what made the original memorable. Slice, which dominated the citrus soda category in the 1980s and 90s with its "We got the juice" campaign and bold fruit flavors, is returning as a significantly healthier beverage that targets wellness-focused consumers rather than the indulgent refreshment seekers who originally embraced the brand.

The analysis examines whether nostalgic brand recognition can successfully bridge the gap between past and present consumer expectations, especially when the core product proposition has fundamentally changed. Stumm explores the risks and opportunities inherent in this approach, questioning whether consumers will embrace a health-conscious version of a brand they associate with sugary indulgence, or if the nostalgic connection will create cognitive dissonance that undermines the relaunch.

This case study offers valuable insights for marketing professionals and business leaders considering their own brand revival strategies, particularly around how to balance authentic heritage with contemporary market demands. Stumm's perspective highlights the importance of understanding not just what consumers remember about a brand, but how those memories align with their current values and purchasing behaviors.

The article also addresses broader trends in beverage marketing, including the challenge traditional soda brands face as consumers increasingly prioritize health and wellness over taste and convenience. For marketing strategists, the Slice relaunch represents a fascinating test case for whether strong brand equity can successfully transcend dramatic product changes.
