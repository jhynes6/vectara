The creative powerhouse behind Stark / Raving's patient-centered campaigns has been recognized with one Gold and two Merit Awards at the prestigious Digital Health Awards, cementing the agency's reputation for excellence in healthcare communications that truly connect with patients and providers.

The Digital Health Awards, organized by the Health Information Resource Center (HIRC), represents the gold standard for digital health resources developed for consumers and health professionals. As the largest program of its kind in the United States and an extension of HIRC's National Health Information Awards, the competition attracts entries from leading healthcare organizations, agencies, and institutions nationwide.

"These awards reflect our team's unwavering commitment to creating digital health resources that don't just inform – they inspire action and build genuine connections between patients and the care they need," said Leslie du Roure, Creative Director. "In an industry where clear communication can literally save lives, we're honored to be recognized for work that makes complex medical information accessible and compelling."

The recognition comes at a time when digital health communications have never been more critical. With patients increasingly turning to digital channels for health information and clinical trial opportunities, the quality and clarity of these resources directly impact patient outcomes and research advancement.

HIRC, which serves as a clearinghouse for professionals working in consumer health fields, holds the Digital Health Awards twice annually – spring and fall – acknowledging the rapidly evolving nature of digital health communications. This frequency ensures the awards stay current with emerging trends and technologies shaping how healthcare information reaches consumers.

The winning entries showcase Stark Raving Health's signature approach: transforming complex medical concepts into clear, engaging content that empowers patients to make informed decisions about their health and participation in potentially life-changing clinical research.

This triple recognition further solidifies Stark Raving Health's position as a leader in healthcare marketing, joining their recent successes in rare disease clinical trial recruitment and patient engagement campaigns that consistently exceed industry benchmarks.
