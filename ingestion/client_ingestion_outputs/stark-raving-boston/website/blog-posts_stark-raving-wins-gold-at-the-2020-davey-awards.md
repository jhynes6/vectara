# Stark / Raving Wins Gold at the 2020 Davey Awards

**BOSTON** â Stark / Raving Branding + Digital Marketing takes GOLD for Best Integrated Marketing Campaign at the [2020 Davey Awards](https://daveyawards.com/) â an international award focused exclusively on honoring outstanding creative work from the best small design firms across the world. Stark / Ravingâs âClean Energy Lives Hereâ campaign for the [Massachusetts Clean Energy Center (MassCEC)](https://www.masscec.com/), was submitted with over 2,000 other entries from ad agencies, digital agencies, production firms, in-house creative professionals, graphic designers, design firms, and public relations firms.

The Davey is judged and overseen by the Academy of Interactive and Visual Arts (AIVA) â an invitation-only member-based organization of leading professionals from various disciplines of the visual arts. Current membership represents acclaimed media, advertising, and marketing firms including Spotify, Majestyk, Big Spaceship, Nissan, Tinder, Conde Nast, Disney, Microsoft, GE Digital, JP Morgan, PGA Tour, Wired, and many others.

The Davey Awards entries are judged to evaluate distinction in creative work. In determining Gold winners, entries are judged on their merits based on a standard of excellence as determined by the AIVA. Entries are scored on a hundred-point scale and generally, Gold Winners receive a score of 90 or above. No more than 10% of entries are awarded a Gold Davey.

The âClean Energy Lives Hereâ campaign was conceived to promote MassCECâs commitment to making clean energy inclusive, approachable, attainable, and actionable across the state of Massachusetts. Strategically designed to create awareness around clean energy, the firm delivered tactical programs that would create the biggest impact, including digital and out-of-home assets.

âWorking with the team at MassCEC was inspiring,â remarked Stark / Ravingâs Associate Creative Director, Leslie du Roure. âThis was a first-of-a-kind campaign for them, and partnering with Susan Mlodozeniec â Marketing Director, Peter Mc Phee â Senior Program Director, Meg Howard â Program Director, and Jacqueline Guyol â Program Administrator, helped us understand their unwavering commitment to spreading the word about clean energy across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. It was a team effort to help them bring their goals to fruition with the dynamic, inclusive campaign our team worked diligently to create for them.â
