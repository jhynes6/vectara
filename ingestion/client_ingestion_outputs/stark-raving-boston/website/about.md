# A Team of Innovators and Creators

About Stark / Raving

We built Stark / Raving because breakthrough innovations deserve breakthrough creativity. Your business solves real problems – but generic campaigns fail to connect with audiences that matter. Traditional agencies lack either strategic depth or creative boldness. We combine industry insights with fresh thinking to turn innovations into compelling campaigns that drive results.

What sets us apart? We challenge conventional thinking while exceeding marketing objectives. Our talented team brings expertise across strategy, design, content, media, and production – united by excellence and purpose-driven creativity. We foster meaningful connections between your business and customers who need your solutions.
