# ellaÂ® Emergency Contraception

### ellaÂ® is a prescription-only emergency contraceptive that offers protection for up to 120 hours after unprotected intercourse, but faced significant challenges differentiating itself from over-the-counter options like Plan B. Despite being the only emergency contraceptive pill that is proven effective when the risk of pregnancy is at its highest, ella struggled with brand awareness and accessibility issues. The brand needed to overcome deeply ingrained stigmas around emergency contraception while educating consumers about critical differences between prescription and OTC options.

### Our team reimagined the ella brand to move beyond clinical messaging toward an empathetic, empowering approach focused on real women. We developed a comprehensive brand messaging playbook that shifted the conversation from embarrassment to empowerment, centering authentic female experiences and proactive reproductive health rather than crisis management. Our strategy emphasized ella’s role as a smart, forward-thinking choice for women who want to take control of their reproductive futures.

### We created messaging that encouraged women to gain access to ella before they needed it, transforming the brand from a reactive solution to a proactive empowerment tool. Our approach centered on wiping away stigma by reframing emergency contraception as responsible self-care. The cornerstone was our tagline “When you’re not ready, ella is” – acknowledging women’s agency while positioning ella as the reliable partner ready to support them when life doesn't go according to plan. This comprehensive rebrand was implemented across all touchpoints, including the website, direct-to-patient materials, and direct-to-physician communications.

### The empathy-driven rebrand transformed ella’s market position, significantly increasing brand awareness with strong brand recall, particularly among younger women who responded favorably to the stigma-free approach. Healthcare provider engagement improved through updated materials that better articulated ella’s clinical advantages, while patient advocacy groups praised the campaign for advancing more open conversations around reproductive health and contributing to broader cultural shifts in how women approach emergency contraception.
