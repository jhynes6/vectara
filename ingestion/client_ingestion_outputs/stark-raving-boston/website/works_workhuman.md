### Workhuman is an annual conference that galvanizes organizations worldwide to create more human workplaces, but faced intense competition from established HR conferences like SHRM and emerging workplace culture events. As a leading provider of social recognition solutions, they needed their signature conference to reflect their innovative approach to building stronger, more human cultures through recognition. The event featured an all-star lineup of celebrities and industry thought leaders, but translating that star power into record-breaking attendance required cutting through the noise of countless HR conferences competing for the same business leaders and HR professionals.

### Our team positioned Workhuman not as another HR conference, but as the movement that's transforming how the world works â€“ where celebrity insights meet cutting-edge research to create workplaces that put humanity first. We were responsible for directing all media planning, execution, and reporting along with creative and messaging development. Rather than focusing on typical conference benefits like networking and education, our campaign emphasized the unique opportunity to be part of a global movement toward more human-centered business practices.

### We leveraged the star power of celebrity speakers while highlighting Workhuman's proven methodologies and award-winning SaaS technology, creating messaging that resonated with HR leaders ready to move beyond traditional recognition programs toward more strategic, culture-transforming approaches that drive real business results.
