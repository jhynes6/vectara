**BOSTON** – [The MarCom Awards](https://marcomawards.com/) has announced that Stark / Raving Branding + Digital Marketing has won six awards in the 2021 international creative competition for marketing and communication professionals. The MarCom Awards is one of the oldest and most well-respected creative competitions in the world and has recognized exceptional achievement by creative professionals from over 300 categories in Print, Web, Video, and Strategic Communications.

Stark / Raving was awarded a Platinum Award for Website Design (Eck MacNeely Architects) and a Platinum Award for Annual Report Design (Massachusetts Clean Energy Center 2020 Industry Report). They also took two Gold Awards for Logo Design (Vecna Robotics and Seeqc Quantum Computing), and one Gold Award for Website Design (MOK Advisors).

“ This year has presented creative challenges we never thought we would have to face as an agency,” remarks Stark / Raving President, Matthew Stumm. “To me, these awards speak a little less about the product and more about the people behind their creation. [Our team](/about) puts their heart and soul into the work they create. And none of this would have been possible without our supportive clients and their tireless efforts to continually collaborate with us remotely. A task that can be easier said than done!”
