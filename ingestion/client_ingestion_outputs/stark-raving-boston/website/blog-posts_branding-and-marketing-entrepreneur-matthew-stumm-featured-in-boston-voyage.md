Matthew Stumm, Founder and Creative Director of Stark / Raving Branding and Marketing, was featured in the January issue of Boston Voyager, where he discusses the realities of building a marketing agency in one of America's most competitive business markets. The interview explores how young marketing firms navigate the challenge of establishing credibility while competing against established agencies, the unique obstacles that come with scaling creative services, and the strategic decisions that determine whether a marketing startup thrives or fails in a saturated market.

"The list of 'firsts' was long and sometimes a little daunting—first major client presentation, first campaign launch, first time managing multiple accounts simultaneously," said Matthew Stumm. "Eventually, it all became more natural to manage. I just try to stay focused on today's obstacles, whether that's delivering exceptional creative work, proving ROI to skeptical clients, or building systems that scale with our growth. The fact that there are obstacles is a good thing – it means we are growing as a company and taking on bigger marketing challenges."

Stumm's perspective offers valuable insights for marketing professionals and business owners alike, particularly around how to differentiate a marketing firm when every agency claims to deliver "results-driven" campaigns. His approach focuses on turning complex business ideas into clear, compelling brand messages that actually drive conversions—a philosophy that has helped Stark / Raving compete against larger agencies by delivering measurable business results rather than just creative awards.
