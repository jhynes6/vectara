**BOSTON** – Stark / Raving Branding + Digital Marketing takes PLATINUM for Best Integrated Marketing Campaign at the 2020 MarCom Awards – one of the oldest, largest, and most prestigious creative competitions in the world. Stark / Raving’s “Clean Energy Lives Here” campaign for the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, was submitted with approximately 6,000 other print and digital entries from dozens of countries around the globe.

[MarCom Awards](https://marcomawards.com/) recognize the outstanding achievement of creative professionals involved in the concept, direction, design, and production of marketing and communication materials and programs. Entries come from corporate marketing and communication departments, advertising agencies, public relations firms, design shops, production companies, and freelancers. Judges are industry professionals who look for companies and individuals whose talent exceeds a high standard of excellence and whose work serves as a benchmark for the industry. Winners are selected from over 328 categories in Print, Web, Video, and Strategic Communications.

The “Clean Energy Lives Here” campaign was developed to promote MassCEC’s commitment to making clean energy inclusive, approachable, attainable, and actionable across the state of Massachusetts. Strategically designed to create awareness around clean energy, the firm delivered tactical programs that would create the biggest impact, including digital (website, banner ads, Pandora banner ads, social media ads, digital downloadable guides and resources, email drip campaigns) and Out of Home (OHH) assets including bike share kiosks, solar recycling bins, and static billboards.

“It’s an amazing honor to be awarded Platinum from the MarCom award committee,” remarked Stark / Raving Founder and Creative Director, Matthew Stumm. “The work we produced for the campaign speaks volumes about the power of collaboration between the talented team at Stark / Raving and the true experts in the clean energy space at MassCEC.
