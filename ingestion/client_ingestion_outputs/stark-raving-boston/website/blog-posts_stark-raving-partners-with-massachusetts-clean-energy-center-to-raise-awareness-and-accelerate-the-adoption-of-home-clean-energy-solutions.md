**BOSTON** – Stark / Raving, a branding and marketing agency specializing in climate tech and renewable energy, announced the launch of a public awareness campaign for the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center. The campaign, which focuses on encouraging residents to make the transition to a clean energy home, recently made its state-wide television broadcast debut. This initiative builds upon the success of a two-year campaign aimed at educating residents about residential clean energy technologies. The goal is to accelerate the adoption of clean energy and support the Commonwealth’s objective of net-zero emissions by 2050.

“As we face an unprecedented climate crisis, it’s clear that we need to take drastic measures to mitigate its impact,” said Matthew Stumm, President of Stark / Raving. “We believe in the power of marketing to promote a more sustainable future for us all. By inspiring collective action, we can create a groundswell of support for the technologies that will make a real difference.”

The campaign is anchored by a comprehensive website featuring information, resources, and interactive tools to guide residents as they incorporate clean energy into their homes. [www.CleanEnergyLivesHere.com](http://www.cleanenergyliveshere.com/)

Our valued partnership with Stark / Raving drives this effort forward, and we are enthusiastic about continuing to work together on the campaign.”
