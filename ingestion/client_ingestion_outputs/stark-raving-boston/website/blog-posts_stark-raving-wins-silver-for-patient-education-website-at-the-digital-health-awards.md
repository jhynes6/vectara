This year's competition showcased the exceptional caliber of healthcare marketing excellence, featuring 80 diverse categories and attracting over 400 entries from marketing agencies, healthcare organizations, and communications professionals worldwide. The breadth and quality of submissions made the competition particularly challenging, with judges evaluating campaigns that addressed everything from patient education and pharmaceutical marketing to public health initiatives and medical device launches.

We are deeply honored to receive Silver recognition for the Affordable Insulin Project website in the highly competitive Web-Based Health category, which specifically celebrates digital marketing initiatives that improve patient outcomes and healthcare accessibility. This award validates our approach to transforming complex healthcare information into clear, actionable digital experiences that truly serve patients' needs while driving measurable engagement and conversion results.

The Affordable Insulin Project website exemplifies our commitment to purpose-driven healthcare marketingâ€”creating digital platforms that don't just inform but actively help patients navigate critical healthcare decisions. By combining strategic user experience design with compelling content and clear calls-to-action, the site successfully guided thousands of diabetes patients toward affordable insulin resources, proving that effective healthcare marketing can deliver both social impact and exceptional performance metrics.

Our heartfelt congratulations go to our client, whose vision and commitment to patient advocacy made this impactful project possible. We also extend our sincere gratitude to the Health Information Resource Center for recognizing excellence in healthcare communications and for championing marketing initiatives that prioritize patient welfare alongside business objectives. This recognition reinforces our belief that the most effective healthcare marketing campaigns are those that genuinely serve patients while achieving strategic business goals.
