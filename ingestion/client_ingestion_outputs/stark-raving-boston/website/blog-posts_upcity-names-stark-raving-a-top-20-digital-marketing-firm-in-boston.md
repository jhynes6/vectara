**BOSTON –** UpCity, the leading marketplace connecting growth-minded small-to-medium businesses with high-performance digital marketing agencies, announced its prestigious 2019 Top Agencies rankings, highlighting the top 1% of US marketing firms based on comprehensive performance metrics and client satisfaction scores. Stark / Raving Branding + Digital Marketing earned recognition as a Top 20 digital marketing firm for the competitive Boston market, placing the agency among an elite group of marketing companies that consistently deliver measurable business results for their clients.

This recognition reflects UpCity's rigorous evaluation process, which analyzes agencies across multiple performance indicators including client retention rates, campaign performance metrics, industry expertise, and verified client reviews. The platform specifically focuses on identifying agencies that excel at helping small-to-medium businesses achieve sustainable growth through strategic digital marketing initiatives, making this award particularly meaningful for agencies that prioritize ROI and long-term client success over vanity metrics.

Boston's digital marketing landscape is notably competitive, with hundreds of agencies vying for recognition in a market that includes major corporations, innovative startups, and established institutions. Being named to the Top 20 validates Stark / Raving's approach to transforming complex business challenges into clear, compelling marketing strategies that drive real revenue growth for clients across diverse industries.

"This recognition from UpCity reinforces our commitment to delivering marketing strategies that turn prospects into customers and media spend into measurable revenue," said Matthew Stumm, Founder and Creative Director of Stark / Raving. "Our clients don't need another agency that creates pretty campaigns—they need partners who understand their business goals and can execute strategies that directly impact their bottom line."

The UpCity marketplace serves as a trusted resource for business owners seeking marketing partners who can demonstrate proven results rather than just impressive portfolios. Their ranking methodology emphasizes agencies that excel at client communication, project management, strategic thinking, and most importantly, delivering campaigns that generate qualified leads and drive business growth.

This award adds to Stark / Raving's growing list of industry recognitions, including their recent Gold AVA Digital Award for the Affordable Insulin Project campaign, which demonstrated how purpose-driven marketing can achieve both social impact and exceptional performance metrics. The consistent recognition across different award programs validates the agency's unique approach to marketing that prioritizes clarity, strategy, and measurable results over creative awards alone.
