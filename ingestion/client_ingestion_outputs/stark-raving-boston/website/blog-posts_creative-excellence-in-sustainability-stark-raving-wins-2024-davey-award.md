Innovation in sustainability communications took center stage as Stark / Raving Branding + Marketing earned a 2024 Silver Davey Award for its “Clean Energy Lives Here – Jump Right In” campaign for the [Massachusetts Clean Energy Center](https://www.masscec.com/). The integrated campaign, which captured the judges’ attention with its fresh approach to energy education, topped entries from agencies worldwide in the Sustainability category.

“Sustainability storytelling requires a unique approach – one that balances technical accuracy with emotional resonance,” explained Leslie du Roure, Creative Director at Stark / Raving. “This campaign succeeded because it made clean energy initiatives accessible and compelling to a wide range of audiences.”

The winning campaign transformed complex energy concepts into clear, actionable messages that inspired community engagement. Through strategic multichannel execution, the campaign demonstrated how creative storytelling can accelerate the adoption of sustainable practices.

Matthew Stumm, President of Stark / Raving, shared his perspective on the win: “This recognition goes beyond just creative excellence. It demonstrates that when you combine strategic thinking with powerful storytelling, you can help drive meaningful change. Our team is particularly proud of this campaign because it aligns with our values of supporting innovations that benefit society.”

[The Davey Awards](https://daveyawards.com/) honor exceptional creative work from smaller agencies, companies, and firms that harness big ideas to compete against industry giants. Judged by the Academy of Interactive and Visual Arts (AIVA), a select assembly of leading professionals from acclaimed media, advertising, and marketing firms, the Daveys set the benchmark for creative excellence in categories ranging from integrated campaigns to branding initiatives. The awards take their name from the biblical tale of David and Goliath, celebrating agencies that triumph through creativity and innovation rather than sheer size and resources.
