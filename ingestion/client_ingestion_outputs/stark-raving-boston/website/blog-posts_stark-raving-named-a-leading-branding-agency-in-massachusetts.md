# Stark / Raving Named a Leading Branding Agency in Massachusetts

Today, we are looking to celebrate another milestone for our company as we announce our latest [Clutch award](http://clutch.co/)! We are very delighted to announce that Clutch has named us a leading branding agency in Massachusetts. Our team is very happy to be recognized for our impressive branding services locally.

Branding is extremely important to any company, business, or organization out there! That’s why at Stark / Raving Branding + Digital Marketing, we make sure that you are receiving the best services possible to help you grow your business.

Clutch, for those of you who don’t know, is an established platform in the heart of Washington, DC, committed to helping small, mid-market and enterprise businesses identify and connect with the service providers they need to achieve their goals.

This is a great achievement for us and we can’t wait to celebrate it with our clients! Before that, here is our Founder and President, Matthew Stumm, to officially receive this award: “Being named a leading branding agency by Clutch truly reinforces our belief that building great brands starts with building strong relationships with our clients. It’s the foundation of our company culture, and we are very proud to be recognized by our colleagues.”

We put our clients first, and happy to have found a platform, such as Clutch, which also upholds this value. We’re looking forward to collecting more client reviews, and coming up with innovative brand ideas alongside new and existing clients!
