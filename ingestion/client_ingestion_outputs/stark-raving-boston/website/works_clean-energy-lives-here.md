# Clean Energy Lives Here

### Massachusetts residents want to take climate action but don’t know where to start. The Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA) and Massachusetts Clean Energy Center needed to break through the noise and show people that clean energy solutions are accessible, practical, and available right now – not someday in the future.

### We turned Boston’s busiest transportation hub into an impossible-to-ignore climate action command center. Leading up to Earth Day, our team secured exclusive advertising rights throughout South Station and deployed over 30 strategically placed creative pieces that surrounded commuters with actionable clean energy solutions.

### Instead of abstract environmental messaging, we showcased specific ways Massachusetts residents could reduce their carbon footprint today – from solar incentives to heat pump rebates to EV charging networks. The campaign transformed a routine commute into an inspiring call to action, proving that when you meet people where they are with solutions they can actually use, environmental awareness becomes environmental action.

### Our strategic takeover of Boston’s South Station created an immersive experience that cut through the daily commute clutter and delivered concrete, actionable climate solutions directly to Massachusetts residents. By focusing on practical benefits and immediate opportunities rather than distant environmental goals, we transformed one of New England’s most trafficked transit hubs into a powerful catalyst for clean energy adoption across the Commonwealth.
