Campaign Criteria

Targeting

Describe your top three target personas (clients): 
 We sell to Marketing Directors (or senior level marketing personnel) at companies with 50+ employees – we tend to avoid large companies – we do not have the people power to support those types of programs.
 We sell to marketing decision makers at companies of less than 50 employees
 We sell to founders / business owners of companies without a marketing department or infrastructure. We try to avoid “small businesses” – the project sizes with those companies are too small.
 Focus on Life Sciences and Healthcare organizations, but on a corporate marketing standpoint. Also, clean energy, but not limited to these. 
 Life sciences health (hospital, medtech, pharma, biotech) 
 will work with startups as well - Founders
 Renewable/clean energy
 Startups here do not have money - not a target 
 Eversource - we can go after larger companies here
 We don't want to go after trades - like people installing solar pannels
 (Oil and gas is not their typical client)For later campaigns: Boston Mass campaign, local B2B, 25-50
 Are there industries you won’t sell to? 
 Retail
 eCommerce
 B2C
 We mostly focus on B2B

Offerings

What services do you sell to your top 3 target personas? (ex. PPC, Social Content, Email Marketing) 
 Comprehensive marketing programs that include strategy, creative development, media planning and buying, and reporting. Mostly focused on lead generation and raising brand awareness
 Branding services for companies that have outgrown their current messaging / look and feel - this includes brand strategy, messaging, identity, collateral and website development
 Creative services to support their internal marketing teams. Most companies on the smaller side do not have the creative support they need internally - so we serve as their “creative department” without the overhead expense
 For each service, what are your top offers (packages/examples) that you would be willing to pitch them?
 Let's discuss some successful strategies for this during our onboarding call - we would like to know from you what you have found successful in the past

Cost of Services

What is your average order value? What are your “Starting At” costs for your services?
 This really depends. Below are some rough numbers
 Long term programs = $250k - $1M
 Short term programs = $75k - $150k
 Project based = $30k - $50k
 Retainer model = Minimum $10k a month

Service Differentiation

What makes you different from your competitors? What is your “special sauce”?
 Full service agency under one roof - not a virtual agency
 Award winning agency
 Strong investment in the operational aspects of marketing and branding to ensure seamless execution of your jobs
 Veteran team with decades of executing and delivering on projects
 Diverse set of service offerings
 Big agency work and smaller agency pricing
 Responsive team - answers within hours not days
 Dedicated project lead to service your account
 Tailored solutions for each branding / marketing challenge. We certainly have a tried and true process - but we are agile in our approach. One do not believe in a one size fits all model
 Sounds silly but we are nice people to work with - we hear this all the time. We deliver. Never miss deadlines. Always there when clients need us.
 If there is any problem - we take responsibility and always solve the issue as quickly as possible
 A large percentage of our work comes from repeat clients - we must be doing something right
 We are accountable, transparent, and truly believe we are a part of your team

Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? What do you do to improve their business?
 We are currently dissatisfied with our current agency and we are looking to make a switch. Oftentimes the reasons for switching are that their current agency is 1. Not delivering value, 2. Not reliable, 3. Not providing strategic consultation, 4. Not “creative” enough
 Our agency focuses heavily on being a true partner - not just a vendor. In addition to great service, we work on building a relationship with our clients where they come to rely on us. On average, we have clients we have worked with continually for 5+ years with high satisfaction scores.
 We have a high profile project / product launch / initiative and we need a trusted partner to deliver on the job. We need an agency that can work under high pressure deadlines and deliver high quality work product.
 We know that 90% of the work we do is deadline driven, and we have built an infrastructure that allows us to onboard clients quickly, operationalize the job so we can execute rapidly, and we are nimble enough to pivot as the project evolves.
 We are dissatisfied with our media vendor. They are not delivering the results we anticipated and there is not enough transparency on attention to our campaign. They are setting and forgetting our project - not providing honest feedback to what is working and what is not. We need an agency that is collaborative and transparent – providing insights and recommendations on a regular basis to improve the performance of our campaigns.
 Our media team is highly attentive to each campaign we run. We consistently monitor and optimize campaigns to maximize their ROI. We believe that their success = our success. We know that it is all about performance – and that is our main focus.
 We have been using a collection of agencies to execute our work - but it is difficult to manage multiple players. We are looking for a singular agency that can handle all aspects of our branding / marketing initiatives.
 We are full service - all under one roof. We are not a virtual agency - our entire team is made up of FTEs who are always available to support their work. We can also scale up and scale down based on their needs.
 The agency we work with just doesn't understand our business / industry.
 We have a wide range of experience across multiple verticals. We invest a lot of time understanding our client’s needs, their business landscape and the challenges they face. Our job is to be their solution, not someone they need to continually educate.
 Our agency is difficult to work with - egos, constantly complaining, surprise billings, etc.
 Customer service is a very important component of our business. We want our clients to do repeat business with us. This doesn't mean we won’t challenge them or pushback – but we do this in a very consultative and constructive away. If we see a better solution - we will always recommend it. If we disagree - we have conversations to ensure we are all working toward the same goal. And we are very transparent with our pricing and our results. 

Case Studies and Previous Customer Successes

For each service, what are case studies or recent customer successes that you use to highlight your expertise in your field?
 We have a list of case studies on our website - mostly visual representations of our work. 
 See https://www.starkravingboston.com/case-studies/
 If you think it would be helpful, we can develop some more detailed case studies with metrics if you think that will drive more interest. Just let us know.
