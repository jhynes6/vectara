Sales Targeting, done right.

The  challenge - Our client, Sock Fancy, is a custom
socks retailer looking to expand their corporate sales
pipeline.

The creative solution - When it comes to targeting the
right propspect, we know the amount of emails the
CEOs and the VPs get. Hence, we got creative and
targeted all the Executive Assistants to the CEOs of the
Company instead.

"Mint Leads really is the perfect partner for scale. I could
spend  money  on  advertising,  but  why  would  I  when  I
can give that budget to MintLeads, and they put booked
appointments  on  my  calendar?  I  don't  have  to  chase
the  leads,  reschedule  them,  none  of  that.  I  look  at  my
calendar  to  see  what  meetings  I  have  for  the  day,  log
onto  Zoom,  and  close  them.  I  continuously  have  6
figures worth of deals in my sales pipeline and close at
a 24% closing rate. "

Testimonials.

WHAT OUR CLIENTS SAY

Jeff Sneed
Partner, BigPxl

Email marketing has a ton of competition, so determining
the right company to work with isn't easy.  After a short
ramp-up period, the leads started to pour in. Even six
months later, the leads haven’t slowed down.

My business partner, who oversees sales, came into my
office and said, "These are some of the best leads I have
seen in my 20 years of doing sales." I highly recommend
Mint Leads to anyone wanting to fill their sales reps
calendars with quality leads.
