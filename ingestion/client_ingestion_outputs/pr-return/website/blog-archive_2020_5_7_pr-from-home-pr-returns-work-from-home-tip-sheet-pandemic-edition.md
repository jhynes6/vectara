# PR From Home: PR Return’s Work-From-Home Tip Sheet – Pandemic Edition

You've heard about eating a good breakfast, making sure your tech works before joining an important online meeting, and making time to stretch and stay active while working remotely. Now, as we’ve entered another month of staying at home to slow the spread of the coronavirus, it's time to take things up a notch. In between continuing to serve our clients and staying busy, the PR Return team put our heads together to provide you with these can’t-miss work from home (WFH) tips:

1) Are those tears of despair or hope? No matter, just remember to drink water to keep hydrated and replenish your supply.

2) Miss chatting with your coworkers around the office? Read instant messages from your co-workers out loud in your best imitation of them. It makes you feel like you're having a real conversation with them!

3) For some people, it helps to dress up to maintain a sense of normalcy, but you’re not one of those people! Instead, compromise by pairing your favorite collared shirt with your favorite pair of sweatpants for all your Zoom calls.

4) Since you're going to spend 8-10 hours a day there, make your office or home workspace your own. Deck out your desk with plants, pictures and pets!

5) Though you're likely sleeping in a little later, don't underestimate the continued importance of caffeine. Equally importantly, don’t overestimate your skills as a barista by trying anything too fancy!

6) To help get in the zone, listen to your favorite music or white noise while working, but within reason. It's _really_ hard to edit while listening to thrash metal, so be sure to hit pause when you need to focus on commas.

Now, from the PR Return team, here are our WFH superlatives, some of our lockdown favorites:

**Addie**  
**Favorite song:** “[Gaslighter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbVPcPL30xc),” by Dixie Chicks  
**Favorite snack:** Apples and Trader Joe’s white cheddar corn puffs  
**Best part:** Working in sweats  
**Worst part:** Not getting to see friends and loved ones (co-workers included)  
**Biggest surprise:** I’m working out _more often_ since before the lockdown began – for the sake of my mental health and to balance out frequent snacking!  
**Parting advice:** Be extra kind and patient during this time – with yourself and others!

**Kraig**  
**Favorite song:** Miley Cyrus’s fireside [cover of “Wish you were Here,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUYo8xQf4PY) by Pink Floyd on SNL at Home  
**Favorite snack:** Mixed nuts, chocolate covered almonds  
**Best part:** No commute (extra time)  
**Worst part:** No commute (missing my bike)  
**Biggest surprise:** A tie – (1) We have restarted our family blog after a 3+ year hiatus – [Smituccis.com](https://smituccis.com/) and (2) all the amazing streaming musical performances we’ve been enjoying  
**Parting advice**: Compartmentalize or schedule your distractions so they don’t overtake you!

**Nick**  
**Favorite song:** “[Boom Boom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X70VMrH3yBg)” by John Lee Hooker  
**Favorite snack:** Popcorn  
**Best part:** Being home when packages arrive so nobody wanders off with them  
**Worst part:** Extremely long conference calls – 2 hours is doable; more than that gets iffy  
**Biggest surprise:** How cool a lot of people’s home offices are!  
**Parting advice:** Don’t forget about your car – make sure to drive it at least 20 minutes once a week to keep it in good working order

**Paul**  
**Favorite song:** Lately, anything by Supertramp  
**Favorite snack:** Peanut M&Ms  
**Best part:** Walking my dog multiple times during the day  
**Worst part:** Missing Starbucks  
**Biggest surprise:** Competing with my wife and daughter for the best Zoom background shot in the house  
**Parting advice:** Don’t wait until your work environment is perfect (dishes washed, bed made, etc.) to start work. Open the computer and get going with that first cup of coffee. Fit everything else in during short breaks.

**Victoria**  
**Favorite song:** “[Good as Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmbmeOgWsqE)” by Lizzo  
**Favorite snack:** Smoothies and assorted Trader Joe’s snacks  
**Best part:** Frequent worktime visits from my cats  
**Worst part:** Not getting to see my coworkers in person  
**Biggest surprise:** I’m drinking the same amount of coffee and tea  
**Parting advice:** If you have ever considered making cold brew at home, there’s no time like the present!
