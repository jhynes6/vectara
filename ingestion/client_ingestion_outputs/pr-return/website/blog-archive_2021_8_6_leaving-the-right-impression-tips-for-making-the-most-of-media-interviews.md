# Leaving the Right Impression: Tips for Making the Most of Media Interviews

While many company leaders boast extensive knowledge about their particular industries and related issues, media interviews can intimidate even experienced business executives, but practice, training and some good planning can set the stage for success. A fundamental building block of any public relations program, effectively communicating a company’s message while skillfully answering reporters’ questions can greatly enhance the value of a news story while also driving positive brand sentiment and elevating a company’s profile.

A well-trained company spokesperson should be able to successfully navigate an array of questions in any media interview – from simple to more complex or even leading questions. Likewise, spokespeople should be prepared to deliver strong messaging, conduct interviews with confidence, and successfully integrate their expertise and their brand within the reporter’s agenda.

Regardless of the topic or subject matter of the interview, some general ground rules apply. When preparing for a media interview, spokespeople should keep the following objectives top of mind:

*   Define your view of issues that affect your industry
*   Develop better working relationships with members of the media
*   Face each interview with increased confidence and control
*   Assure your message is communicated with as little editing/interpretation as possible

To further refine your media interview skills and leave the right lasting impression each time, consider the following tips:

*   **Preparation:** Take the time to review notes or a briefing document prior to any interview to understand the reporter’s agenda and give yourself a chance to come prepared with informed, concise, on-message responses. Good preparation can increase comfort level and make for a more relaxing, conversational interview and positive results.
*   **Know your audience:** Have a firm grasp of the reporter’s beat and the audience they typically cater to so you know how to communicate with them effectively. Avoid industry jargon the audience may not understand to ensure everyone can follow your message.
*   **Deliver key messages:** Before the interview, think about the 3-5 key points you want to convey. Also be prepared to substantiate any claims with prepared facts, research or supporting points.
*   **Be clear and concise:** Long-winded responses typically fail to deliver the key message and can veer the conversation off course. Speak clearly and not too fast. Deliver your key messages in short, memorable 15-second information nuggets. If you need to elaborate, summarize, explain and summarize.
*   **Stay on track and keep composure:** Not every interview will go as well as hoped. If a difficult situation arises or a negative question is asked, keep your composure and remain focused. Responding negatively to any disruption or question could backfire. Instead, try to neutralize the negative question and then bridge to one or two pertinent points that will present a more positive view.

Always try to end an interview by positioning yourself as a resource and context provider for future stories. By serving as a credible expert and making things easy for reporters, you can increase the likelihood that they’ll come back for more quality insights.
