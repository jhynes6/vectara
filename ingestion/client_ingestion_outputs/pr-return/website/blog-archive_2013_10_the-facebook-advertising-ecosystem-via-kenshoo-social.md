# The Facebook Advertising Ecosystem, via Kenshoo Social

Facebook users know the pros and cons of the people they follow. Personally, I can't wait for updates from some of my friends, but I'm less than interested in a lot of the other things I find in my feed. I've long thought the same about the advertisements I see when I log into Facebook; sometimes I see something relevant, but in the past, I've been just as likely to see ads I have absolutely no interest in. If you're thinking of advertising on Facebook, take a look at these [facebook ad statistics](https://www.ninjareports.com/53-facebook-statistics-2019/).

I've seen major improvements in the relevance of the ads I see in Facebook lately. Some of the merchants I shop with (but don't follow on Facebook) have even begun to serve up ads just for me via [Facebook's Custom Audiences](https://www.facebook.com/help/459892990722543/ "Custom Audiences"); basically, if they have your email address and you have a Facebook profile, they can serve you Facebook ads. Today, everything about my Facebook experience is more relevant than it used to be, and the remnants of irrelevance have more to do with me not customizing my experience than with Facebook falling short anywhere.

This increased relevance (and satisfaction) is certainly due in part to the improvements being made by Facebook itself, but technology platforms like [Kenshoo Social](http://kenshoo.com/products/kenshoo-social/ "Kenshoo Social") deserve some credit too. Kenshoo Social (a leading global social marketing platform and Facebook Strategic Preferred Marketing Developer (sPMD) for Facebook Ads with native access to the Facebook Exchange) provides advertisers with advanced technologies and tools they can't get working directly with Facebook that enable advertisers to deliver relevant ads and offers to consumers at scale (much like [Kenshoo Search](http://www.kenshoo.com/products/kenshoo-search/ "Kenshoo Search") provides for Google, Bing and other top search engines around the globe).

As technology providers like Kenshoo Social, advertising agencies and Facebook continue to refine the approach and increase the relevance of advertisements served to Facebook users, the entire ecosystem benefits. Users see more relevant ads, and advertisers accomplish more with the ads they buy. Just this week, Kenshoo Social gave a nod to the Facebook advertising ecosystem releasing [an infographic - the Facebook Advertising Ecosystem](http://kenshoosocial.com/education-resources/facebookadecosystem/ "Kenshoo Social Infographic"). The metrics are astounding:

*   Advertisers drove more than twice the revenue from Facebook ads in Q3 than they did in Q2
*   For every dollar spent in Q3, advertisers earned more than three times the return they realized in Q2

Advertising supports the free and open Internet we all enjoy; so the overall health of the entire Facebook advertising ecosystem is something every Facebook user (and shareholder) should be happy about. We've just touched on a couple of the stats here. See the full Kenshoo Social infographic for a lot more detail about how ads on Facebook have become more relevant and effective thanks to digital marketing companies like Kenshoo Social that help advertisers maximize their impact on Facebook.
