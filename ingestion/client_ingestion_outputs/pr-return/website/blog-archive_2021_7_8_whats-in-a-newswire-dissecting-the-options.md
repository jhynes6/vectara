Press releases have been a key component of public relations for ages. Want to alert the media and consumers to a new product, offering or insight? Put out a press release. Want to issue a statement for public consumption? Put out a press release. Hired a new executive and want to sound the bells of success? Put out a press release.

But how you disseminate that press release and who it reaches is a much more complex equation. Public companies must meet disclosure requirements while private companies do not need to. Some announcements are critical for public record and to create an online index of company news but might otherwise draw little scrutiny and coverage. Some press releases form the backbone of a public relations campaign while others are simply a side dish to the main course. Then there are geographic targets based on the type of news and intended reach: global, continental, national, regional and local.

Newswire considerations can get complicated quickly. Let’s take a look at the various newswire types available for press release distribution and remove some of the mystery.

## **Top Tier: Big Names; Big Budgets**

_The Players:_ PR Newswire, Business Wire, Globe Newswire, etc.

_Cost:_ Fee per first 400 words; additional fee for every 100 words over 400; tracking and reporting fee; fee for multimedia (images, video, charts, etc.) inclusion

_Added benefits:_ Meet public disclosure requirements; usually includes expert editorial review

_Drawbacks_: Cost

## **Second Tier: Solid Options; Save Some Cash**

_The Players_: ACCESSWIRE, Newswire, etc.

_Cost:_ Flat fee with no word limit

_Added benefits:_ Tracking and reporting included; multimedia included; meet public disclosure requirements

_Drawbacks_: Not as established as the big names above

## **Third Tier: Decent Performers; Minimal Investment**

_The Players_: PRWeb, Send2Press, etc.

_Cost:_ Low flat fee with no word limit

_Added benefits:_ Tracking and reporting included; multimedia included

_Drawbacks_: Web release only (no direct email to reporters); smaller news outlet network

While not hard and fast rules nor a comprehensive list of wire services, these designations present a quick reference guide to provide a better understanding of the types of available offerings. Matching the wire service to goals of the press release can help narrow down the choices and ensure dollars are well spent.

## **Example scenarios**

### **Scenario A**

_Goal_: A public company issues a press release to serve as the definitive statement with limited direct pitching to reporters to supplement the wire distribution.

_Best Match_**_:_** Top tier services

_Reasoning:_ They have the largest news networks for automated placements, allow reporters to subscribe to receive direct notifications of news matching their beats and meet public disclosure requirements.

### **Scenario B**

_Goal_: A private company issues a press release announcing a new piece of momentous industry research, and its PR firm will also pitch the news directly to relevant media reporters.

_Best Match_**_:_** Second tier services

_Reasoning:_ A large news network will produce automated placements. Reporters will receive pitches on the research directly from the PR firm. The release can include charts and graphs that illustrate key findings from the report.

### **Scenario C**

_Goal_: A private company issues a press release announcing an executive hire and its PR firm will pitch the news directly to relevant media.

_Best Match_**_:_** Third tier services

_Reasoning:_ A smaller, online-only news network will provide some automated placements. Reporters will receive pitches on the research directly from the PR firm, but coverage is most often minimal and appears in “new hires” or “people on the move sections” of industry trades. The release can include a photo of the executive.

Of course, these are basic examples that don’t account for more nuanced scenarios such as preferred wire services, agency discounts, volume-discounted release packages and more.
