# Offbeat Sheet: Lighthearted Lightfoot Provides Humor and Hope to Chicago

**PR Return’s Offbeat Sheet examines some of the world’s most interesting technology, marketing and innovation stories. Often pushed quickly through the news cycle, we think they deserve more time in the spotlight.**

“Stay home, save lives.” Politics aside, we can all appreciate a timely and effective marketing campaign. If you’ve spent any time on social media in the past few weeks (as many of us have), you’ve likely gotten wind of Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s efforts to encourage and educate her constituents on the importance of staying home to stop the spread of the coronavirus. If not, you’ve definitely seen a few memes circulating along with her #StayHomeSaveLives hashtag, or from fans all across the internet, including on Instagram under @WheresLightfoot, an account created by Chicago’s own Danny Martinez that racked up almost 30,000 followers in a matter of days. Here are a few of our favorites from – where else? – Lightfoot’s Twitter.

Not only are the countless memes created by Lightfoot’s own team as well as her fans laugh-out-loud funny; Lightfoot’s PR strategy includes well-executed key elements that other businesses should note:

*   Social media: Lightfoot is both leading the conversation and actively participating and responding to others. This two-way street approach is paramount to successful social media use.
*   Press engagement: From her involvement with entertainers, news outlets, medical experts and everyday citizens, Lightfoot’s multi-pronged media approach ensures the widest reach possible.
*   Timeliness: Lightfoot’s message could get stale with too much repetition, but she’s consistently providing fresh information and new, fun content to keep people engaged; for example, her new #ChicagoGoodWorks hashtag highlights some of our local helpers.

This campaign was a team effort spearheaded by City of Chicago Chief Marketing Officer Michael Fassnacht. This former FCB CEO just started working with the city in March, and, earning just $1/year, it’s safe to say Chicago is getting its money’s worth with this brilliant marketer.

We admire the lighthearted approach Lightfoot and her team took in spreading awareness about the importance of staying home. Since she provides some levity and entertainment, the content is naturally shareable on social, furthering the transmission of her message. It’s genius, and she’s not slowing down!

“Giving people hope and using humor is a great way to break through the noise and reach people,” said Lightfoot in a recent interview with Trevor Noah. We couldn’t agree more.
