# Separate Personal Opinions and Business Like Oil and Water

_Microsoft Employee Shouts His Opinion of “Always On” Before Getting His Mic Turned Off_

Every now and then we get a reminder of the power of social media and why it’s important for companies large and small to have a social media policy for their employees. Most recently, Adam Orth, (now formerly) creative director for Microsoft Studios, provided a reminder by engaging in a very public Twitter debate about the rumored “always on” internet connection required for Microsoft’s next generation gaming console (successor to the immensely popular Xbox 360):

The debate and subsequent outcry sparked waves of coverage, eventually resulting in [a public apology from Microsoft](http://majornelson.com/2013/04/05/official-statement-on-what-was-said-yesterday/) and Orth’s resignation. We’ve seen more than one employee [lose their job over something they posted on Twitter](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/15/fired-over-twitter-tweets_n_645884.html#s112801&title=Cisco_Fatty_Loses); so Orth isn’t alone. Still, these events offer a perfect opportunity to review a few key social networking best practices for brands and employees.

**Best Practices:**

1.  Every company should have a written social media policy focused on the sharing of company information and the types of stances that can/cannot be taken, explaining what is and is not acceptable (here is a copy of [U.S. Government General Services Administration Social Media Policy](http://www.gsa.gov/graphics/staffoffices/socialmediapolicy.pdf)).
2.  Remind employees that when they speak about company products or services, even if expressing personal opinions, they represent the brand.

**Potential Pitfalls:**

1.  Even when set to “private,” social networks remain a public forum; people should think carefully about what they share before they share it no matter if they are an executive, an assistant or a job candidate. Think of it this way: would you feel comfortable with what you’re sharing appearing in the company newsletter? If not, it’s probably best to keep it to yourself.
2.  Once it’s out there, there’s no taking it back. Tweets and posts may show a delete button but archives, screen captures and public conversation can keep them alive long after they’ve been deleted.

Social networks are great outlets for news, information and opinions and can be readily embraced by both brands and individuals, but looking before you leap can be the difference between an engaging online discussion and a social networking fiasco. Slow down. Think it through.
