## Ready to Answer the call for cannabis expertise?

# Patchwork regulations, for now

Confusing and divergent regulations have cannabis businesses struggling to find compliant ways to connect with customers, protect themselves legally, fund raise and even bank. With so much legal variance from state to state and throughout the world, confusion reigns, but organizations that put forth helpful experts in the spirit of education and thought leadership have much to gain.

# How can PR grow your business?

Consumers and cannabis businesses alike want to better understand the regulations, opportunities and knowledge-gaps affecting cannabis, and the educators and thought leaders that emerge can produce big equity for their brands and businesses.

Legal, accounting and other ancillary businesses can leverage PR to provide the expertise cannabis businesses need to get covered in top trade and business media and grow their brands. Cannabis and CBD product marketers can put forth experts to clarify what many consumers consider to be a confusing landscape of products and buying options. Either way, brands that help others better understand the challenges they face can cost-effectively build recognition and market share along the way.

PR transcends many regulatory hurdles, but while thought leadership will remain effective for the foreseeable future, the PR opportunity facing cannabis-focused businesses may never be bigger than it is today with so many trying to make sense of what’s new.
