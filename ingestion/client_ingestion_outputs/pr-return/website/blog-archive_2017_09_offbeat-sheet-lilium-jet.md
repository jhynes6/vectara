# Offbeat Sheet: The Lilium Jet

**_PReturn’s Offbeat Sheet examines some of the world’s most interesting technology, marketing and innovation stories. Often pushed quickly through the news cycle, we think they deserve more time in the spotlight._**

Transportation services like [Uber](https://www.uber.com/) and [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/) have been around for a handful of years, but the latest step into modern transportation is reminiscent of “The Jetsons.”

Say hello to the [Lilium Jet](https://lilium.com/), an all-electric air taxi that lifts off vertically, hovers and accelerates up to 186 mph before landing. This past spring [a test video](http://mashable.com/2017/09/05/lilium-jet-90-million-closer-to-manned-flight/#qgPNp1zo.iq7) illustrated proof of this fantastical air taxi’s capabilities. Theoretically, a 50 minute commute could be cut to 5 minutes with the help of the Lilium Jet.

With the concept video, and sheer magical innovation, Lilium attracted investors like Twitter co-founder Ev Williams and his venture group [Obvious Ventures](https://obvious.com/). Lilium recently announced it has secured $90 million in Series B funding from Obvious Ventures, along with [LGT](https://www.lgtcp.com/en/), [Atomico](http://www.atomico.com/), and the Chinese investment firm [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/en-us/).

“This investment is a tremendously important step for Lilium as it enables us to make the five-seat jet a reality," said Lilium Co-founder/CEO Daniel Wiegand.

It’s possible that in two years you’ll hail an air-taxi wherever you want to go. While the cost of the service is yet unknown, you can bet it’ll cost more than a regular ride with Uber or Lyft. Will you be among the first to take a ride in a flying car, just like [the Jetsons](https://giphy.com/gifs/the-jetsons-MWAJkQR2MJEEo)?
