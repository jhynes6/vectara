# Media training is FUNdamental!

On January 12, "The Daily Show" featured a segment entitled "Pundit School" with media training advice and tips for political talking heads. Daily Show correspondent, Jason Jones quipped that almost anyone can become a pundit. Well, we're not all political pundits and much of this is obviously intended for comedic effect, so some of the advice in this clip should be taken with a grain of salt, but, within certain contexts, it also makes some good points for company spokespeople who seek to do a better job in front of the media.

Some helpful tips to consider:

- Body language counts
- Use bold action words
- Have your messages in mind
