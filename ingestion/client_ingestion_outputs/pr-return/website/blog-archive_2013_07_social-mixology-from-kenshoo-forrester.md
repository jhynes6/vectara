# Social Mixology from Kenshoo & Forrester

Kenshoo Social released some interesting research conducted by Forrester Consulting back in May, and I'm excited to share some highlights.

Available for complimentary download from Kenshoo Social, ["The Key to Success"](http://www.KenshooSocial.com/ForresterStudy "They Key to Successful Social Advertising") examines how large social advertisers (those spending at least $100,000/year on social media ads) use social advertising in an effort to educate marketers on how to develop winning social media strategies and tactics.

The study found organic posting (owned media) to be the most popular social media tactic (remember, this study surveyed advertisers), but paid advertising was found to be the most successful. The ideal approach coming out of the study, though, leveraged a combined/holistic approach to social media communications and advertising. So the advertisers using paid promotion to amplify their most successful organic posts should expect the best results!

The study is packed with other helpful findings for companies still getting their social media bearings. A couple of examples include:

*   Social advertisers are still not using advanced optimization tactics: more than half reported rotating ads, but only one-third use granular targeting to reach the right audiences (an inherent strength of social).
*   Social marketers should pay for promoted content to drive awareness and buy ads to drive sales.

Key takeaways for marketers?

1.  Start with clear marketing objectives
2.  Promote your brand and your content
3.  Take advantage of robust targeting
4.  Develop a holistic approach for greater success
