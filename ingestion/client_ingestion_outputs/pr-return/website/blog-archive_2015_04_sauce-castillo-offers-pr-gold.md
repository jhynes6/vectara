# “Sauce Castillo” Offers PR Gold

When Sacramento Kings’ rookie shooting guard Nik Stauskas hit a three-point shot recently, closed captioning offered an interesting interpretation, giving birth to an incredible nickname: “Sauce Castillo.”

Within minutes, [#SauceCastillo](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SauceCastillo&src=typd) was trending on Twitter. As soon as Stauskas embraced his nickname, a golden PR opportunity was born. [https://twitter.com/NStauskas11/status/580959773421535234](https://twitter.com/NStauskas11/status/580959773421535234)

The PR team for the Sacramento Kings seized the opportunity and created [Sauce Castillo Night](http://www.nba.com/kings/blog/join-kings-sauce-castillo-night-4/5): “When the Kings take on the Utah Jazz on April 5, we will celebrate Nik Stauskas’ new nickname, Sauce Castillo. All fans in attendance will receive a special Sauce Castillo giveaway, and there will be saucy fun all game long.” Now THAT is how you capitalize on a golden social media opportunity. Well played, Sacramento Kings PR team ... well played.
