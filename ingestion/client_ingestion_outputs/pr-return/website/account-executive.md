# PR Account Executive – Full Time – Remote

PR Return seeks a public relations and marketing account executive to join its experienced team, focused on media relations and thought leadership for top BtoB technology companies.

Love media relations, pitching to earn great coverage, and all the legwork and attention to detail required to be successful? Want to work on a wide array of projects and establish a healthy schedule and work/life balance?

We need a self-starting and ambitious account executive or assistant account executive with excellent organizational skills, attention to detail, and ideally, solid media relations experience, to join our team. We’re looking for someone with a knack for making technical content easy to understand who can juggle multiple projects and deadlines effectively.

## Responsibilities and duties

*   Media relations: serving as a resource to media, pitching, researching, etc.
*   Writing: news writing, ghostwriting, etc.
*   Awards and speaking opportunities: research, proposal writing, deadline tracking, etc.
*   Administrative and account management tasks
*   Working with other team members and clients
*   Agency marketing: blog, social, sales support, etc.
*   Administrative and general office work

## Qualifications and skills

Candidates should have a positive/can-do attitude, keen attention to detail and a desire to work with some of the world’s top-rated BtoB technology companies. Ideal candidate will have 2-3 years’ media relations and writing experience and a passion for working with editorial media – especially technology, business and trade media; blogs; etc.

Being remote, PC and light troubleshooting skills will help. While social media experience is a plus, this is just a small fraction of the job.

## Benefits

*   Medical, dental and vision insurance
*   Paid time off
*   Full-time and remote

In business for more than 17 years, PR Return transitioned to fully remote in 2020. While we are based in Chicago, the ideal candidate can be anywhere in the United States. We pride ourselves on our track record, client and employee retention rates, high-quality media relationships, hard work, focus on results, and work/life balance.
