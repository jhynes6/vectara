# Constantly Connected Consumers – Brands Can Take Advantage

When Martin Cooper made the first handheld mobile phone call 40 years ago he couldn’t have imagined the impact mobile devices would have on the world’s ability to connect in 2014. The same can be said for brands, which are now in the driver’s seat more than ever when it comes to their mobile visibility. It’s how they drive that vehicle that will determine their engagement success.

When a consumer interacts with their favorite brand via mobile applications, they do the talking, not the other way around, driving advocacy and brand loyalty. In fact, recent research by Indiana University suggests that interactive apps for mobile devices are fast becoming the most powerful forms of advertising, and tackle the challenges faced by the declining influence of mainstream media for brand advertisers.

With substantial upsides come issues. One of the worst mistakes a brand can make is not taking full advantage of the enhanced capabilities of today’s consumer devices. Sending out materials in static fashion that the consumer can’t interact with is a mistake, and not optimizing that content for mobile is an even bigger boo-boo. If a brand engages poorly, consumers quickly shift to a competitor or publicly share their negative experience. To avoid these risks:

* Be sure that your business is engaged and quick to answer any comments via social networks, as mobile users are consistently engaging with their favorite brands.
* Think adaptive links. These intelligent URLs identify when users are on a mobile device, and open the app to the corresponding app "page." Further, Pure Oxygen Labs leverages adaptive links to prompt app downloads if users don’t already have that given app.
* Think like the big boys. According to AdGooroo, Amazon is garnering a huge number of mobile impressions through their own branded keywords.

As more consumers rely on mobile devices (in their pockets, on their wrists or faces) brands must continue to adapt. Traditional outreach methods may never completely go away, but brands need to rethink how they engage mobile audiences.
