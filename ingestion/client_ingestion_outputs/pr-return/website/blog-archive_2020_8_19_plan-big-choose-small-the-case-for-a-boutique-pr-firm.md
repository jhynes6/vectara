# Plan Big, Choose Small: The Case for a Boutique PR Firm

PR firms come in just about every size, from a handful of seasoned professionals putting their heads together to global enterprises with offices in multiple countries. While they can’t necessarily scale to quickly meet demand of the world’s largest brands, the right small PR agency can offer marketers many advantages they just can’t get from big firms.

**Priority Treatment**

Many clients have hired PR Return over the years after less-than-successful stints with larger PR firms, citing a lack of priority treatment. A B2B HR software company selling to global enterprises, for example, entrusted its PR and media relations efforts to PR Return after growing tired of feeling like a small fish in a big pond. We welcomed them to our small pond and changed their opinions about the value of an effective PR partnership.

**Teamwork That Lasts**

The shuffle of personnel on an account team or the absence of senior leadership can stifle the productivity of a PR partnership with agencies large or small, but history has shown us that the revolving-door-of-junior-staff problem wreaks havoc much more often with large PR firms.

“Marketers have shared this concern with us many times, and I saw it firsthand during my time at the world’s largest independent PR firm,” said PR Return Founder Kraig Smith. “It’s understandable how difficult this could be for any professional services firm with its sights set on scale, but talent and team continuity provide tremendous value to marketers who hire us to help them tell their organizations’ stories. From Day One, we’ve focused on retaining our best talent and providing this team continuity.”

**Sector Expertise**

Large PR firms tend to work across a wider variety of industries, but partnering with PR pros that bring relevant experience to the table can be far more beneficial. We recommend marketers inquire about the experience of the proposed account team prior to hiring an agency partner.

PR Return specializes in B2B PR, and our specific experience in the technology, marketing, logistics, healthcare, professional services and cannabis industries gives us a leg up in building effective media relationships and strategies. Small, knowledgeable PR teams with people familiar with a particular industry can also hit the ground running more effectively than others and bring quality, practical ideas to bear on behalf of brands.
