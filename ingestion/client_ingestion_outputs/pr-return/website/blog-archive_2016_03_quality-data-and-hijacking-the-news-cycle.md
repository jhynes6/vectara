# Quality data and hijacking the news cycle

Easter is coming up – you’d better believe brands will be jumping like the bunny to post a clever holiday-based tweet or two. In much the same way, savvy PR pros with access to quality data can hijack the revolving news cycle to promote their data prowess.

Whether its holidays, elections, quarterly earnings or major sporting events, PReturn is a big believer in taking advantage of those golden days on the calendar where reporters are looking for insights, by positioning related information to leverage the media buzz and call attention to your business.

Pitching data that ties your expert’s knowledge into what’s already making headlines means half the battle is already won. Coat-tailing, piggybacking, hijacking - whatever you call it— gives reporters quality insights when they’re most in need increases the chances your data winds up in their stories.
