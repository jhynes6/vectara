# The PR of Pollution vs. the PR of Principles

A few of the major global PR firms and their practices have been in the news lately, and it hasn’t been pretty. According to a peer-reviewed paper from researchers at Brown University and published in [_Climactic Change_](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-021-03244-4), some of the world’s most prolific polluters have relied on PR for the last 30+ years to influence the way consumers think about pollutants. In its story on the paper, the [_Washington Post_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/11/30/how-big-oil-relies-some-pr-firms-block-climate-action/) cited three findings:

*   PR firms have run hundreds of campaigns for oil and gas companies that often rely on third-party groups — sometimes called “front groups” by climate activists.
*   These PR campaigns have helped shape public discourse about climate change by popularizing phrases such as “clean coal,” “renewable natural gas” and “carbon footprint,” according to the study.
*   Yet the role of PR companies in preventing climate action has flown under the radar, in large part because “the work of PR firms requires that they ‘remain invisible,’” the authors write.

The named agencies? Burson Cohn & Wolfe (formerly Burson-Marsteller), Ogilvy (formerly Ogilvy & Mather) and Edelman. No surprises there. Upon publication of the paper, however, [_Adweek_ noted](https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/edelman-clients-and-climate/) Edelman in particular reviewed its clientele and opted to stick with the polluters, perhaps in an effort to enact change:

“Instead, the company’s CEO Richard Edelman told _Adweek_ that it will work alongside clients to improve their climate plans and reduce emissions and impact. ‘We’re going to have engagement about a path forward based on our principles,’ he said. ‘We clearly want to be with companies that are accelerating action. But if we can’t, then we will part company.’”

Only time will tell if that’s anything more than paying lip service to weather the storm.

Regardless, the study and the following news coverage raises the age-old question: does just because we can, mean we should? We can only speak for ourselves, but at PR Return, we prefer to use the power of PR for clients whose principals match our own. When asking ourselves if we should, sometimes the answer is a resounding “no.”

We’re advocates for the power of PR. While we’re certainly not perfect, we strive to be principled and ethical and believe that’s something our clients appreciate about us. We reject the old adage “all PR is good PR,” and this study highlights a perfect example of why.
