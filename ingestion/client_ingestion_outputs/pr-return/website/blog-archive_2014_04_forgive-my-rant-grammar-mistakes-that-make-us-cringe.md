# Forgive My Rant: Grammar Mistakes That Make Us Cringe

Writing’s tough; we know it. Constantly brainstorming ideas, finding your voice and establishing a flow can be enough to exhaust even the most enthusiastic wordsmith, and this is all before making sure you don’t distribute that press release containing a glaring grammatical error. Of course, working in PR has reduced our tolerance for some of the most common mistakes, and putting forth an image of professionalism lies at the forefront of our duties to ourselves and our clients. Not to mention grammatical errors make you look foolish and are just straight embarrassing _(probably why we triple-check everything)!_ Here’s a list of the biggies that make us wince, cringe and crawl under our desks.

**1. There, Their, They’re**

*   There – location, location, location. “I’m going over _there_ to think about that awful grammatical mistake.”
*   Their – expresses possession. “It’s _their_ report; they can fill it with mistakes if they want.”
*   They’re – contraction of they are. “_They’re_ going to be really unhappy when I show them how many mistakes were in this draft.”

**2. Affect, Effect**

*   Affect (v.) – “Those grammatical mistakes you consistently make are going to _affect_ your chance at a raise.” Remember, the “a” stands for action.
*   Effect (n.) – “Your grammar has a big _effect_ on what employers think of you.”

**3. A lot, Alot**

*   A lot – think quantity! “This release has _a lot_ of mistakes; so I’m going to be using _a lot_ of red ink.”
*   Alot – This word simply does not exist; we’re mystified by how often it’s used. Please, just stop it.

**4. Literally**

*   Whatever you say following literally is exactly true. Literally means it’s 100 percent fact!
*   “I _literally_ shuddered when I saw all the grammatical errors in that press release.”

**5. Then, Than**

*   As a rule of thumb, use than when comparing things, and then in all other instances.
*   “If you want to be a better writer _than_ your colleague, _then_ you’d better correct these blatant grammatical mistakes!”

**6. Your, You’re**

*   Your – expresses possession.
*   You’re – a contraction for you are.
*   _“You’re_ going to need a lot of practice to improve _your_ writing.”
