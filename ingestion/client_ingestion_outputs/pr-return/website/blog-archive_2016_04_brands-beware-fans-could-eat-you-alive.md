# Brands beware – fans could eat you alive

Twitter – the wonderful world where brand to consumer interaction is readily available and honestly can play big dividends – unless, of course, you choose to mess with the “The Beygency” or “The Beyhive,” the excitable and extremely devoted arm of Beyoncé's loyal online following.

Lululemon found that lesson out the hard way, when a seemingly innocent tweet about [Beyoncé‘s Ivy Park athleisure collection](http://mashable.com/2016/03/31/beyonce-ivy-park-video/#Ua5IRuCWGGql) garnered a big-time pushback. Meer moments later …If we’re being honest, we didn’t see much wrong with Lululemon’s fun poke. However, since “The Beyhive” did, Lululemon gave us a great lesson in consumer relations on social media by responding individually, apologizing for their “transgressions” against Queen Bey and removing the tweet before it could do any further damage.

Lesson learned: When you’re a big brand, think critically before sending a tweet that could be received harshly, because fans that are “crazy in love” are always watching. And if you do cross that line, own up to it and apologize before moving on.
