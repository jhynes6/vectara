# 7 ways PR is just like dating

Dating is just like public relations. Before you laugh, ask yourself: What’s the first association you make when it comes to PR? If you said relationship management, you’re on my wavelength. Whether it’s client or journalist interactions, many aspects of dating apply to PR surprisingly well. Of course, you're not going to get much explicit adult chat in the world of PR, so I guess that's where the similarities just about end. Anyway, here’s the breakdown.

**1. Putting yourself out there**

Binge-watching Netflix from your couch can be fun, but it’s not likely to find you love (unless you count falling in love with a show, which I do). If you’re not actively searching for new opportunities, it’s a long shot you’ll meet any great prospects. Sure, you’ll get set-up once in a while, but the strongest relationships are those you forge on your own. That goes for clients, reporters and significant others alike.

**2. The research**

Much like you use major social media channels to find common ground or red flags with a budding love interest, (don’t be ashamed, everyone does it), the same sort of research goes into finding the journalist who is perfect fit for current client resources or the prep for a first meeting with a potential new client.

**3. The first date**

Meeting a potential client mirrors a first date; you’re dressed up, you’ve done your research and you’ve prepared questions, all with the intention of convincing them you’d be good to keep around for a while. The same goes for a journalist; since you’re trying to establish yourself as a reliable resource starting with the first interaction. This is very akin to speed dating.

**4. Wait three days before you call**

The last thing you want when dating is to appear desperate. Give reporters time to absorb that beautifully crafted pitch, then make your follow-up calls to reel them in. Let your messages brew with potential clients before presenting a contract. If they like you, you’ll know.

**5. Compromise to ensure happiness**

Chances are, you’ve juggled dates and weighed your options when looking for love. In PR, your list is always going to be full of priorities, and splitting time wisely between client projects and media relations is essential to effectively find the right “match.”

**6. Deliver on your promises**

Intense competition on the dating scene is the norm, and like dating, PR agencies pop up every day vying for clients. By not delivering on your promises, you open the door for the competition. Just like keeping promises is important in a relationship, it’s equally important to your clients.

**7. The break-up**

Inevitably, some relationships don’t work out. In PR, not every client can become a 15-year-retainer, and not every reporter stays with the same publication forever. Do your best to keep relationships alive and well, but if a separation occurs, part amicably and don’t burn any bridges. Like mom always said, there’s more fish in the sea.

As with relationships, hard work and dedication are key when it comes to PR. Establishing and nurturing client and reporter needs isn’t something that should go away when that honeymoon period is over. While keeping those flames burning can sometimes be a challenge, you’ll be happy you did when you find “the one.”
