Campaign Criteria

Targeting

Describe your top three target personas (clients): 
 Marketers at technology companies with at least $3M (and less than $300M) in annual revenue, especially in shipping/logistics/supply chain, robotics/automation, human resources and legal services
 Marketers or CEOs (Nick - COOs too? I left them off in the interest of greater focus) at well-funded technology startups, especially in shipping/logistics/supply chain, robotics/automation, human resources and legal services
 Corporate communication professionals at technology companies, especially in shipping/logistics/supply chain, robotics/automation, human resources and legal servicesHC: 10+
 Are there industries you won’t sell to? 
 No but we would like to avoid BtoC companies that sell to consumers and focus exclusively on BtoB

Offerings

What services do you sell to your top 3 target personas? (ex. PPC, Social Content, Email Marketing) 
 Public relations brand building and thought leadership (we don’t buy ads - we help clients earn credible media and analyst coverage and establish their brands and people as experts in their fields)
 News and corporate communications (creating a steady stream of attention-grabbing news, blog posts, white papers, etc.)
 Media relations and analyst relations (arranging interviews and briefings, tapping credible third-party influencers to build brand recognition and establish expertise)
 Messaging and content development (synthesizing value propositions to raise awareness of what makes clients different/unique/valued partners and key challenges and problems they can help their customers solve)
 For each service, what are your top offers (packages/examples) that you would be willing to pitch them?
 Public relations can be a little tricky to quantify, but we deliver what we call BOTTOM LINE MARKETING. This means we help them earn the most credible kind of brand exposure available today and don’t require them to spend money on ad buying. So credible exposure at much lower costs. Clients leverage the coverage we secure for them and the content we develop for them to fuel social media communications, lead gen programs, email newsletters, etc. If they want to add a dose of credibility to what they are doing, we are the answer (for some, this means something as simple as getting news out more regularly and honing their messages; for others, this means upgrading the content they use in customer emails, marketing campaigns, LinkedIn and other social promotions, etc.
 We can also offer a complimentary assessment; so if they meet with us, they’ll at least take away some tips and tools they can act on independently even if they decide not to hire us.

Cost of Services

What is your average order value? What are your “Starting At” costs for your services?
 Our hourly rate is $150/hour, and our minimum monthly retainer is $5,000 (34 hours). Our larger client budgets range from $10,000 to $18,000/month. We put forth contracts with no end dates but that include 30-day out clauses. Sometimes clients ask for 12-month contracts instead, and we sometimes take on projects for clients when there is the possibility/potential for growth. Ultimately, our client engagements need to balance work levels and expectations with an adequate budget and bank of hours to support that work.

Service Differentiation

What makes you different from your competitors? What is your “special sauce”?
 First and foremost, we offer senior/experienced counsel and do not bait and switch clients with a junior account team. The team you meet at PR Return is the team you keep, and we have won many clients away from larger PR firms with an offer of senior counsel and a senior account team. Compared to larger agencies, we are also more affordable, which gives clients the best of both worlds. 
 With nearly 20 years of experience under PR Return, we have encountered many problems and situations, and we have a keen ability to help clients articulate what makes them great, often in ways they have not considered. 

Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? What do you do to improve their business?
 We’re doing great things, but nobody knows about them. We need to more effectively support our sales team. 
 Solution: PR Return helps clients create compelling messages, document their successes, and take their news and expertise to market in a way that creates a trail of credibility for business to help them grow leads, sales and market share. 
 Our prospects have no idea how smart our people are and how effective our solutions can be for them.
 Solution: PR Return builds and executes thought leadership campaigns for clients, positioning their experts as thought leaders in the markets that matter most and raising awareness of important problems and best practices core to our clients’ value propositions.
 Media and analysts are writing about our competitors but not us. We need to put a stop to this. 
 Solution: PR Return acts as your outsourced media and analyst relations department to help you overcome these challenges and fight for the recognition your business deserves. 

Case Studies and Previous Customer Successes

For each service, what are case studies or recent customer successes that you use to highlight your expertise in your field?
 The media coverage, thought leadership, and analyst coverage that result from our PR campaigns can be hard to quantify by specifically attributing to things like increased sales and revenue. 
 For Fizyr, a European company that provides the industry’s most advanced vision to systems integrators and robotics integrators that provide the world’s most effective high variability automation, PR Return has raised the company’s profile by establishing a steady stream of news, blog post content, thought leadership and accolades (awards). Through our messaging sessions, we helped Fizyr own the term “cascade learning” to encapsulate what allows their computer vision to outperform all other options available in the market today. In our second year supporting Fizyr, we help them continue to expand their North American business with a wide ranging media relations, analyst relations, content marketing and thought leadership campaign focused on Europe and North America.
 Digital marketing software powerhouse Skai, formerly Kenshoo, has worked with PR Return for more than 15 years. At times deploying an expansive media relations, thought leadership and analyst relations campaign, PR Return continues to promote Skai to the financial analyst community, showcasing the power, data and well-known brands associated with Skai to a broad audience of business and financial professionals. 
 UnitedLex, a legal services provider powerhouse with 3,000+ employees and nearly 20 global offices, relies on PR Return to envision, create and promote compelling thought leadership content, award nominations and news that gets covered and gets them noticed. In an industry known for resisting change and innovation, PR Return helps UnitedLex promote its engine for law firms and corporate legal departments seeking to harness technology to transform their businesses and better serve their clients. 


Suppression List

If you have a list of companies that we should not be sending any emails to, please let us know. 
 One .xls or .csv file of these company’s domains needed. If domains are not provided, these contacts could be reached. This is not yet complete, but at least we’ve gotten a start.

Example suppression list:
 Nick - looks like i need to create a simple spreadsheet. I’ll plan to include our entire client list, anyone we’ve ever entered time for, and then I’ll sort of think through past prospects in case there’s anyone else we want to blacklist. I don’t want to put off other things any longer; so I’m going to save this for Friday/Monday or sometime soon.
