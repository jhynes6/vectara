## Marine Medical Management Solutions  
Maritime transportation operations are logistically complex and sometimes require employees to operate within remote environments for extended periods of time – with limited access to traditional medical resources.

Over the past several years, HealthWorks has served as the Medical Director for many of the region’s largest maritime transportation companies providing a variety of medical management solutions. We provide mariners with 24/7 remote access to a healthcare provider. Our healthcare medical staff understands the unique challenges of the maritime industry. We develop treatment plans best suited to meet the unique needs of employees. Our goal is ensure every mariner has the knowledge they need to self-manage their recovery plan while maintaining work aboard their vessel eliminating the need to offboard the vessel for further medical care.

## Our Marine Medical Management Services

##### ELECTRONIC MEDICAL “BOARDING PASS” SOLUTIONS
> On-boarding Electronic Medical Questionnaire (EMQs) are used as a  
> “boarding pass” to assess if any changes in health occurred while off work. Offboarding EMQS are used to assess if the associate has any changes in health while on the vessel.

##### PRE-EMPLOYMENT + RETURN TO WORK SERVICES
> This service is used to ensure candidates are medically qualified to perform the job. By evaluating if candidates’ conditions are stable and within the safety standards, injuries and off-boarding are decreased.

##### JOB TASK ANALYSIS + PHYSICAL DEMANDS TESTING
> Our team of evaluators specialize in evaluating jobs and documenting precise reports. This document defines essential job functions and associated physical demands while detailing required skills and environmental factors.

##### INJURY PREVENTION SYSTEMS
> This “high touch” injury prevention system utilizes our team of occupationally trained clinicians, technology, and equipment to deliver a product that is targeted and effective.  
> A recent study by the Healthworks Marine Medical Management team shows that 96% of cases referred to our Injury Prevention Programs ended in successful retention of the mariner to their vessel. The resulting operational cost savings from each offboarding avoidance is estimated to be $29,100.

##### VESSEL MEDICAL MANAGEMENT
> This 24/7 service allows for associates to be assessed and treated by a healthcare provider while on the vessel which can prevent unnecessary off-boarding.

##### MOBILE PHARMACY + TELEHEALTH SOLUTIONS
> Once an injury/illness is identified, our medical team can follow closely with the associate during the trip and monitor medical issues. Medication kits are also available on the vessel that contains a wide variety of medications.

##### VESSEL INJURY PREVENTION + TREATMENT
> Non-recordable virtual intervention with physical therapists that gets associates feeling better faster and keeps them on the vessel.
