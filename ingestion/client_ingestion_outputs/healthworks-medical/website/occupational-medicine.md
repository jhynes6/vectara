## Employee Health Matters.

At Healthworks Medical, we take pride in the fact that our medical providers understand what occupational medicine entails whether it be OSHA recordability of an injury or illness, respiratory fit test requirements, a DOT physical, merchant mariner or a pre-employment physical. We also understand that the medical needs of your employees matter and that a job well done by our medical staff not only saves your company money, but also promotes a sense of being cared for between your employees and your management staff.

**The ultimate goal is to promote the overall health and wellness of a companyâ€™s employees so that the employer saves significant and measurable money on healthcare costs.**
