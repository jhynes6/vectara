# The Impact of Telehealth Injury Intervention on Maritime Workers

Sep 1, 2022

## The Story

HealthWorks Medical, LLC is a leading full-service Occupational Health company headquartered in Paducah, Kentucky. HealthWorks specializes in designing medical cost management solutions for employers that are in search of a reprieve from inflated medical pricing and PPO overpayment.

Over the past several years, HealthWorks has served as the Medical Director for several of the region’s largest maritime transportation companies – providing a variety of medical management solutions.

## The Challenge

Maritime transportation operations are logistically complex and sometimes require employees to operate within remote environments for extended periods of time – with limited access to traditional medical resources.

#### Delayed injury response

#### Inability to access medical facilities

#### Lack of ongoing care

#### **This posed the question:**

How can maritime employers increase access to quality healthcare for their workers operating in austere environments?  All employer partners wanted quality and simplicity with their injury response program that included:

#### Dedicated 24/7 ability to communicate with a healthcare provider from anywhere in the world

#### Access to medical staff that understood the unique challenges of the maritime industry

#### The ability to effectively triage non-emergent injuries in “real-time” prior to offboarding personnel

## The Approach

#### January 1st, 2022 – HealthWorks creates their new “Marine Injury Response Program”.

This “high touch” injury prevention system utilizes a team of occupationally trained clinicians, technology and equipment to deliver a product that is targeted and effective. This program gets associates feeling better fast while keeping them on the vessel. This is achieved through OSHA non-recordable virtual intervention that’s provided through a dedicated “smart app” available on each vessel.

## Program Design

#### So, what does this all cost?

HealthWorks employer partners pay a monthly “per-click” fee to access the Maritime Injury Response Program. On average, employees participate in 4-6 visits per injury.

HealthWorks provides the services below as part of their Maritime Injury Response Program.

### Injury Triage/Assessment

Rapid, virtual intervention with Drs. of Physical Therapy that diagnoses injury and determines proper course of action.

### Injury Treatment

Employees are assigned a treatment program that includes stretches and exercises that improve symptoms quickly.

### 24/7 App Access

Employees have access programs and the ability to directly message Physical Therapists and Strength and Conditioning Specialists with questions.

### Rehab Equipment

Vessels are outfitted with injury prevention kits that include non-rigid bracing and other implements utilized by Physical Therapists.

## The Results

#### 1st Quarter 2022:

A total of 32 unique cases were referred to the HealthWorks Injury Management Team for evaluation + treatment resulting in a 96% success rate.

The resulting operational cost savings from each offboarding avoidance is estimated to be $29,100.

“Success” is defined as creating a treatment plan that resulted in the employee to self-manage their recovery plan and maintaining work aboard the vessel without offboarding for further medical care.
