Typical Obstacles Today For 
Successful Lead Generation

▪ Sky Rocketing Pricing – Prices of leads have 

increased steadily, making them cost prohibitive in 
many cases ranging from $40-70 per lead. 

▪ Lack of Targeting – Many lead providers provide 

leads that can’t pinpoint the audience resulting in 
leads that are too general.

▪ Minimal Data Depth – Most leads contain minimal 

contact data, and lack any firmographic data needed 
for personalization and persona building.

▪ Data Accuracy – Most leads typically have at least 
one inaccurate data point which many times are 
critical to your success.

▪ Restrictive Minimums – Many lead providers require 

large minimums with long term contract 
requirements.

More than 40% of 
marketers view the lack of 
resources as the biggest 
obstacle to lead generation.

You’re losing 33% of your
