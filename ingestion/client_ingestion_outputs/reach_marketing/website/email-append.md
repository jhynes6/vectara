## The Reach Marketing Append Process

* We receive your file of an individual name, company name (if business records), and address records.
* We then append individual email addresses from our premium email database that match the name, company name, and postal address fields within your file.
* Then, we deliver your appended database with validated individual email addresses – not “info@” or “sales@” aggregates.
* You are billed only for validated, deliverable email addresses appended to your file.
