## Common Obstacles We Overcome

#### **Skyrocketing Pricing**

Prices of leads have increased steadily, making them cost-prohibitive in many cases ranging from $40 – $70 per lead.

#### **Lack of Targeting**

Many lead providers provide leads that can’t pinpoint the audience resulting in leads that are too general.

#### **Minimum Data Depth**

Most leads contain minimal contact data, and lack any firmographic data needed for personalization and persona building.

#### **Data Accuracy**

Most leads typically have at least one inaccurate data point which many times are critical to your success.

#### **Restrictive Minimums**

Many lead providers require large minimums with long term contact requirements.

#### **Lack of Resources**

More that 40% of marketers view the lack of resources as the biggest obstacle to lead generation.
