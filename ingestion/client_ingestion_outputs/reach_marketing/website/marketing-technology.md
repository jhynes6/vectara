## Frequently Asked Questions

### What industries does Reach Marketing work with?

Reach Marketing collaborates with a diverse range of industries. These include: Information Technology, Business Services, Media, Financial Services, Manufacturing, Electronic Products, Healthcare, and various other industries, demonstrating the versatility of our services.

### What does platform agnostic mean?

When someone says they are “platform agnostic,” it typically means they are impartial or neutral toward choosing between different technology platforms. In a business context, this can mean that a company or individual doesn’t favor one operating system, software, hardware, or technology over another. Instead, they focus on functionality and performance, choosing the best tools or platforms based on the specific needs of a project or objective, rather than being limited by allegiance to any particular technology. This approach enables flexibility and adaptability in solving technological challenges.

### How many years have you been in business?

Reach Marketing has been serving clients since its establishment in 2011. Over the years, our experience has deepened, allowing us to refine our strategies and services to better meet the evolving needs of our clients. Our long-standing presence in the industry is a testament to our commitment to excellence and the trust our clients place in us.

### Is a Data Warehouse the same as a Customer Data Platform?

While both a Data Warehouse and a Customer Data Platform involve data consolidation, the scope, functionality, and end-use of these systems differ substantially, with CDPs being more focused on marketing needs and customer-centric insights, and data warehouses serving broader analytical needs across an organization.

### How often should I append data?

The frequency depends on your industry and how quickly your data changes. Regular reviews and updates—typically every 6 to 12 months—are recommended to keep data relevant and useful.

### What should I consider when choosing marketing technology?

Evaluate your marketing needs, budget, integration capabilities with existing tools, ease of use, and the specific features offered by the technology. It’s also important to consider vendor support and the technology’s scalability.
