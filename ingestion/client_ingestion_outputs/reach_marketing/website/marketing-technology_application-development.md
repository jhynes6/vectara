## What does platform agnostic mean?

When someone says they are “platform agnostic,” it typically means they are impartial or neutral toward choosing between different technology platforms. In a business context, this can mean that a company or individual doesn’t favor one operating system, software, hardware, or technology over another. Instead, they focus on functionality and performance, choosing the best tools or platforms based on the specific needs of a project or objective, rather than being limited by allegiance to any particular technology. This approach enables flexibility and adaptability in solving technological challenges.

When choosing a development partner, consider their expertise in both application development and marketing, their experience with similar projects, their portfolio of past work, and client testimonials. Evaluate their ability to understand your business needs, provide innovative solutions, and offer ongoing support and maintenance.

## What are key features to include in a marketing application?

Key features to include in a marketing application are user-friendly interfaces, data analytics and reporting capabilities, automation tools, integration with other marketing platforms, personalized content delivery, and security features. These features ensure the application is effective, efficient, and secure.

## What value does an application development consultant bring to marketing technology projects?

An application development consultant provides expertise in designing and developing custom applications for marketing technology systems. They can offer strategic advice, ensure best practices are followed, manage the development process, and provide training and support to maximize the application’s effectiveness.
