# Reach Marketing Wins List Management of Progressive Media Group

PEARL RIVER, N.Y.- Progressive Media Group, a media firm that publishes industry news and provides key resources to decision-makers in a variety of fields including health care, finance, technology and non-profit, has chosen Reach Marketing LLC to manage its multichannel mailing lists for all properties. These properties were formally managed by Statlistics.

Greg Grdodian, Partner at Reach Marketing, expressed his enthusiasm for the opportunity. “Progressive Media Group has a steady track record of serving small and mid-sized businesses with the insights and analysis they need to make informed decisions for their companies. Our extensive experience with managing lists for publishing companies and media firms positioned us as an ideal match for PMG.”

Progressive Media Group offers a broad spectrum of industry publications with expansion in their plans. Reach Marketing will be representing the lists for _The Progressive Physician_, serving physicians and health care professionals for small and mid-sized medical practices, clinics and ambulatory health facilities; _Successful Business News,_ serving small business owners and sales executives in companies with less than 100 employees; and _The Progressive Accountant_, a subscription-based newsletter and associated website that reaches seasonal and full-time tax preparers as well as CPAs.

Reach will also manage the lists for _Nonprofit Technology News_ which serves CEOs, CFOs and other professionals with non-profit expertise, and _Bob Scott’s Insights,_ which serves software manufacturers and resellers a no-nonsense analysis of the industry in a weekly newsletter with a paid subscription base. Further plans to focus on Internet publications that feature financial news are also forthcoming.

Collectively, Progressive Media Group’s current offerings reach an audience of 1.3 million subscribing industry leaders and decision-makers. The media company uses a multi-platform strategy to provide their subscribers with the meaningful analysis they want through newsletters, webinars and live events. In addition, each Progressive Media Group property also has a strong online presence that brings value to subscribers.

“Reach Marketing’s evolutionary approach to list management exceeded our expectations of a list management firm. They outlined a comprehensive plan to optimize their expertise and technology with the quality of our audience. Maximizing revenue from our data asset is essential to our company’s success and we have entrusted that responsibility to Reach Marketing,” said Kurt Martin, Group Publisher.
