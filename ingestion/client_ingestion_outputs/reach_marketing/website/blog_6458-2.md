# Reach Goes Out to the Ball Game

Reach Marketing enjoyed a company night out at the Rockland Boulders Stadium. We all gathered in the Hudson suite and enjoyed a great ball game with a wonderful selection of food as well as a great view! It was a great opportunity to spend time with each other as a team and enjoy a great game to boot! We also got in our annual team photo with the Boulders Bird as well as a few other photos to look back on a great memory. The Rockland Boulders won that night so the stadium celebrated with some gorgeous fireworks. All in all, the night was a win, win! For the Rockland Boulders and for Reach Marketing.
