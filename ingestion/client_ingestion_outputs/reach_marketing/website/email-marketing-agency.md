## Frequently Asked Questions

Explore frequently asked questions about our services, processes, and industry insights.

## Should I include email marketing in my email marketing plan?

Absolutely! Whether you are B2B or B2C, for-profit or non-profit, product or service-oriented, email marketing should be an essential part of your marketing plan. Email marketing allows you to communicate with your customers with personalized messages and content relevant to them, based on their interests and needs. And it’s cost-effective, immediate, trackable, and scalable!

## Is social media less important because of email marketing?

Absolutely not. Although social media has become a major player in the digital marketing landscape, email remains critical for promotions, relationship-building, and conversions. Integrating both channels strengthens results, helping your audience connect across multiple touchpoints.

## Can you build loyalty with email marketing?

Email marketing is a powerful loyalty-building tool. Personalized content, rewards programs, and regular value-driven communication help customers form strong emotional connections with your brand, encouraging repeat business and referrals.

## How can email marketing expand your customer engagement?

Email campaigns — especially newsletters, promotions, and personalized offers — create regular interaction points with your audience. Including strong calls-to-action (CTAs) encourages clicks, purchases, and brand advocacy.

## What are some kinds of email campaigns?

Examples include newsletters, welcome emails, promotional emails, transactional emails, re-engagement campaigns, lead nurturing sequences, and event invitations. Each type plays a role in your marketing and sales funnel.

## Do I need to hire a full-service email marketing agency?

If you need strategy development, creative support, automation setup, list management, or full campaign execution — and don’t have the internal resources — hiring a full-service agency can save time, improve results, and ensure best practices are followed.

## How do I know what works in email marketing?

Measure performance with KPIs like open rates, click rates, conversions, and unsubscribes. Use A/B testing to experiment with subject lines, designs, and offers, then refine your strategy based on the results to maximize engagement and ROI.

## What is drip marketing?

Drip marketing sends a series of automated emails over time based on a user’s actions or a schedule. It’s used to nurture leads, onboard customers, re-engage inactive users, and guide prospects through the sales funnel naturally and effectively.

## Do I need a dedicated IP address to send out my emails?

High-volume senders (over 100,000+ emails/month) often benefit from a dedicated IP because it protects their sender reputation. If you have low to moderate volume, a reputable shared IP from your email service provider may offer better deliverability without the need for warming up an IP yourself.

## Can I track email campaigns?

Yes. Platforms like Mailchimp, HubSpot, and others provide built-in reporting tools that track opens, clicks, unsubscribes, bounces, and even conversions. Integrating with analytics tools allows you to measure real business results driven by your email efforts.

## How does automation help your email campaigns?

Email automation streamlines communication, saves time, and increases relevance. Automated workflows send targeted messages at the right moments based on behavior — helping nurture leads, onboard customers, and re-engage inactive audiences more efficiently than manual sending.

## Why is list building important for your email program?

Building your list with engaged, permission-based contacts is critical for email success. It ensures better deliverability, higher open and click rates, and stronger compliance with regulations like GDPR and CAN-SPAM. A healthy list leads to better long-term revenue growth.

## Does Email Marketing Work for Small Business?

Email continues to be the main driver of customer retention and acquisition for small and midsize businesses. 81% of SMBs rely on email as their primary customer acquisition channel, and 80% for retention. (Emarsys)

As a small business, you have a small budget for marketing. It’s a challenge to make your marketing dollars go far. Every penny allocated to your marketing efforts must deliver an ROI or you risk losing your money and the opportunity to close more sales. You know you need to acquire new customers and retain your existing clients, but you can’t afford to invest time or resources into something that isn’t going to deliver the results you expect.

One of the best ways to spend your marketing dollars is email marketing because it’s a cost effective way to reach your customers on a more frequent basis with personalized messages that encourage engagement and drive sales. On average for every $1 you spend on email marketing your return is $42. (DMA) And a McKinsey study found that email is almost 40 times more effective than Twitter and Facebook combined in attracting new customers.

## How can I reduce email unsubscribes?

To reduce unsubscribes, send valuable and relevant content, personalize your emails, respect your sending frequency, and make it easy for users to manage their preferences. Consistency, transparency, and respect for your audience’s inbox are key to maintaining loyalty.

## Should I clean my email list regularly?

Yes! Regularly cleaning your email list improves your sender reputation, reduces bounce rates, and ensures you are communicating only with engaged contacts. Remove invalid emails, unsubscribes, and inactive users to maintain a healthy, high-performing list.

## Can I track email campaigns?

Yes — and you should! Open rates, clicks, conversions, bounces, unsubscribes, and ROI are all measurable through most modern email platforms. Campaign tracking allows you to optimize performance and align your email marketing with your broader business goals.
