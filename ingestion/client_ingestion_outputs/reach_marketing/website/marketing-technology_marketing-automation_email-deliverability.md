List management is crucial for email deliverability. Regularly cleaning your email list to remove invalid addresses, inactive subscribers, and potential spam traps can significantly improve deliverability rates. Segmenting your list to send targeted and relevant content can also enhance recipient engagement and reduce the likelihood of emails being marked as spam.

## What are some common challenges in email deliverability?

Common challenges in email deliverability include poor sender reputation, high bounce rates, spam complaints, blacklisting, and issues with email content that trigger spam filters. Ensuring proper authentication and maintaining a clean email list are also critical challenges.

## What is sender reputation and why is it important?

Sender reputation is a score that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) assign to your email-sending domain based on factors such as spam complaints, bounce rates, and engagement levels. A good sender reputation is crucial for ensuring high deliverability rates, as ISPs are more likely to deliver emails from reputable senders to the inbox.
