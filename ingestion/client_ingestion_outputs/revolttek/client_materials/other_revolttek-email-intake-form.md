Campaign Criteria

Targeting

Describe your top three target personas (clients): As of now, I want to fucus on restaurants only. All types, just not major chains.
 (ex: We sell to small business owners in the services industry with more than 10 employees) 
 (ex: We sell to marketing decision makers at ecommerce businesses with more than 5 employees) 
 (ex: We sell to founders of technology-enabled companies) 
 Job Titles: Owners/Operator, CEOs, GMs, 
 HC: 1+ 
 Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana 
 Are there industries you won’t sell to? We only sell to Restaurants and Retail sites. At first I want to just focus on restaurants.
 (ex. Health Care, Law Firms, Franchises)

Offerings

What services do you sell to your top 3 target personas? (ex. PPC, Social Content, Email Marketing) 
 We sell POS products to restaurants and retail shops, we also offer payments.
 (ex: Email marketing to small business owners in the service industry)
 (ex: TikTok UGC to Marketing Decision makers at e-commerce businesses)
 (ex: PPC to founders of technology-enabled companies) 
 For each service, what are your top offers (packages/examples) that you would be willing to pitch them? 
 We can offer free POS when they do certain payment processing programs (Cash discounting, surcharge)
 No long-term contracts apart from “free POS deal” 
 (ex: Guaranteed 30% more email revenue in 90 days for SMB owners)
 (ex: First 5 UGC videos for free for DTC E-Commerce Brands)
 (ex: 30 Days Free Ad Management)

Cost of Services

What is your average order value? What are your “Starting At” costs for your services?
 (ex: Email Marketing: campaign strategy, design, development, automation, personalization, and analytics. Pricing is everything from one-off projects at $10-$50k to yearly agreements up to $1MM/year)
 (ex: 1000 Tik Tok Impressions/month + Content Creation= $5000 order value)
 (ex: tier 1: $2500 CPC Budget + $500 Service Fee, tier 3: $12,500 CPC Budget + $2500 Service Fee)

Service Differentiation

What makes you different from your competitors? What is your “special sauce”?
 We offer a “white glove” experience. We do menu build, network, install and training all on site.
 Payment Processing Broker
 (ex: We implement 8 proprietary flows to maximally engage customers via email. 14 touch-points across a 30 day visit to our customers site has been proven to concert the highest % of site visits to paying and repeat customers)

Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? What do you do to improve their business?
 We upgrade their technology and hold their hand as we go through the process. Pain points could be dated or no tech at all.
 (ex: My clothing line has stopped reaching new buyers and we want to break into a new niche. Facebook keeps getting more expensive and makes it hard to target new buyers.
 Solution: Organic UGC content is the perfect mechanism to branch out to new customers. We help you find influencers who are exactly like your target audience, work with them to create videos and then use those videos to penetrate your new niche audience.)

Case Studies and Previous Customer Successes

For each service, what are case studies or recent customer successes that you use to highlight your expertise in your field?
 Don’t have any, but could probably generate some with AI
 (ex: generated 50k in net new sales in 30 days for a service business with a seasonal email marketing campaign)
 (ex: generated 120k in net new revenue with a GenZ-focused organic TikTok Campaign) 
 (ex: increased CTR by 240% and sign ups by 318% with Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo Campaign)
