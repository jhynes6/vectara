Podcast Criteria

Targeting

Describe your top three target personas or people you want to listen/host on your show (clients): 
 -Restaurant and Retail shop owners
 (ex: We sell to small business owners in the services industry with more than 10 employees) 
 (ex: We sell to marketing decision makers at ecommerce businesses with more than 5 employees) 
 (ex: We sell to founders of technology-enabled companies) 
 Are there industries you won’t want to speak to? 
 -Just Restaurant and Retail shop owners
 (ex. Health Care, Law Firms, Franchises)

Offerings

What services do you sell to your top 3 target personas? (ex. PPC, Social Content, Email Marketing) 
 (ex: Email marketing to small business owners in the service industry)
 (ex: TikTok UGC to Marketing Decision makers at e-commerce businesses)
 (ex: PPC to founders of technology-enabled companies) 
 For each service, what are your top offers (packages/examples) that you would be willing to create an ad for? (ONLY IF NECESSARY)
 (ex: Guaranteed 30% more email revenue in 90 days for SMB owners)
 (ex: First 5 UGC videos for free for DTC E-Commerce Brands)
 (ex: 30 Days Free Ad Management)

Podcast Description

What is the preferred description of the podcast?
 Might need some help with this. I want it to be value added for Restaurant & Retail owners.
 A podcast show description is a concise summary describing your podcast to potential listeners. It typically includes the show’s topic, host(s), and what listeners can expect from episodes. 

Service Differentiation

What makes you different from your competitors? What is your “special sauce”?
 So I would rather make the podcast about adding value to restaurant and retail, not necessarily about our products we sell.
 (ex: We implement 8 proprietary flows to maximally engage customers via email. 14 touch-points across a 30 day visit to our customers site has been proven to concert the highest % of site visits to paying and repeat customers)

Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? What do you do to improve their business?
 So I would rather make the podcast about adding value to restaurant and retail, not necessarily about our products we sell.
 (ex: My clothing line has stopped reaching new buyers and we want to break into a new niche. Facebook keeps getting more expensive and makes it hard to target new buyers.
 Solution: Organic UGC content is the perfect mechanism to branch out to new customers. We help you find influencers who are exactly like your target audience, work with them to create videos and then use those videos to penetrate your new niche audience.)

Case Studies and Previous Customer Successes

For each service, what are case studies or recent customer successes that you use to highlight your expertise in your field?
 (ex: generated 50k in net new sales in 30 days for a service business with a seasonal email marketing campaign)
 (ex: generated 120k in net new revenue with a GenZ-focused organic TikTok Campaign) 
 (ex: increased CTR by 240% and sign ups by 318% with Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo Campaign)
