**Joe's Story**
In addition to helping in my father’s business, when I turned 14, I started out bussing tables at a local restaurant. I gradually worked my way up through the restaurant business to being a current Franchise Owner of a successful Seafood Restaurant in Tallahassee, FL. While attending college I earned a certification in web design and have always advanced in networking and technology.

A couple of years ago my restaurant was in need of a POS system that would prove to be reliable, efficient, cost effective, compact and technologically advanced. My search found numerous clunky machines that seemed cost prohibitive, rather antiquated in todays times as well as requiring a majority of my time in front of the system to gain all the information I wanted to acquire from it. After more research we chose, and now fully integrated POS Lavu, Not only in my restaurant, but we have implemented it within the entire chain now and we have grown with this great concept. We continue to test all of our products, services and features on a daily basis within our own network to assure you the best solutions possible.

I am pleased and excited to find this incredibly efficient solution in my own business that has allowed me more time and energy for other aspects in my life. I am also excited to be able to share this opportunity with our customers and clients so that they too can experience better time management, efficient business productivity and literally worldwide real time access, to let their business work for them.

**Jimmy's Story**
At the age of 15, I chose to explore other employment outside the family business and started my first experience in the restaurant industry at Burger King. Throughout the remainder of high school and into college I continued in the restaurant industry performing all aspects of the business from washing dishes, bussing tables, cooking, bar tending, serving and management. After college I found myself a niche in the Locksmith/Security industry and ran with it. I had no idea that would be the start of me owning and operating my own successful business just a few years later. Through time I realized my passion and dream of being a Helicopter Pilot still existed within me, so I decided to pursue that dream and succeeded!

From then through now I have not only started numerous businesses of my own, but assisted others in establishing and succeeding in their business while maintaining my position as an EMS Helicopter Pilot; Furthermore, I have learned and experienced that not only working HARD, but working SMART has dramatically enabled me to continually achieve my DREAMS!

POS Revolt is yet another dream and mission I have chosen to indulge. It is through this mission that will enable me to not only continue to exceed and achieve my goals, but also enhance and enable others to achieve their goals and dreams by utilizing our service and products in order to advance their organizations efficiency and success. We Thank You for your interest and look forward to enhancing the way you do business!
