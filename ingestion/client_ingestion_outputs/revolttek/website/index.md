Genius Payroll pulls hours, tip-outs & employee data directly from Genius For Restaurant POS.

### Kitchen Display

With Heartland Restaurant kitchen display system, orders are automatically sent to terminals in the kitchen from your servers, eliminating paper trails and wait times and minimizing restaurant confusion. When changes occur, Genius For Restaurant KDS immediately updates and inserts changes to the order, increasing the speed of service.

### Gift & Virtual Gift

Gift cards are an excellent source of incremental revenue and they help establish brand identity. The Genius For Restaurant Gift Card program allows users to process gift cards directly through our POS, where you can load gift cards, accept them for payments, and perform balance inquiries, all without any separate hardware. Genius For Restaurant now offers virtual gift cards, purchase and redeem online or in store.

### Loyalty & Guest App

With the Genius Guest App, guests are connected directly to their favorite restaurants. Using iBeacon technology, the app alerts guests when they enter a participating restaurant and invites them to skip the line, decreasing wait times and increasing satisfaction.

### Online Ordering

Our fully-integrated solution for accepting online orders directly on your POS gives your customers the ability to order from anywhere with a user-friendly interface styled to fit your brand.

### Kiosk

Genius Self Order Kiosk is an in-store, customer-facing interface that enables guests to place their own orders. Our kiosk is the optimal solution for restaurants concerned about staffing and rising labor costs.

### Waitlist & Texting

There’s no need for those bulky, costly, limited-range buzzers. Keep track of guests and manage your waitlist with our directly-integrated system.

### EMV Processing

In October 2015, Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express mandated liability shifts for fraudulent transactions. This means that merchants using legacy magnetic stripe readers for accepting credit cards carry the entire burden for merchant chargebacks if a card with a chip is swiped.

### Real support by real people

We offer the best support and service you can imagine. Available 24/7/365.
