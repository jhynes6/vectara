MintLeads Comments: 

For MintLeads use only 
 I have made the following changes: 
 Removed any CTA that speaks of a loom walkthrough (will use in future) 
 I have updated the subject lines as requested, we tend to prefer keeping them short as we have just found that it works well for staying out of the ‘junk’ zone and creating a health campaign but let me know your thoughts. Regarding including AI entrichement in the subjects lines, we are still working to gather data from clients campaigns on our AI systems so for now I have excluded them just to allow a healthy and strong start to this run of campaigns. 
 I have als updated sequence #7 and #8 to use the word “online applications” or “applications” instead of ‘scholarships”

Client Comments: 

This is great! I like your writing style.  
 I have just a couple of questions which I’m sure we can cover Monday:
 The top section of each copy are subject lines - are we to choose, or will they alternately be used? For alternate verbiage within, do we need to choose?
 Regarding the last two sequences (#7 and #8), I’m wondering if we can discuss removing the word ‘scholarship’ altogether and replace simply with ‘application’ or ‘online application’ where applicable. This broadens our scope to any online application process, not scholarships alone. I haven't made edits within the copy and won’t until I hear everyone’s feedback.
 Remove ‘Can I send you a Loom walkthrough showing exactly how this would work for {{companyName}}?’ - for now
