A Shared Vision for Scalable,
Profitable Growth

Spiral USA has built a bold, alternative brand with a loyal following,
but scaling profitably requires more than running ads. It demands
a system-driven approach that unites Growth Strategy, Paid
Advertising, and Advanced Data Analytics -  ensuring every
marketing dollar drives sustainable, long-term profitability.

T H I S   P R O P O S A L   O U T L I N E S   H O W   W E   W I L L :

Align paid advertising with Spiral USA’s business goals—
driving revenue growth while maintaining an MER of 3.0+

Leverage Meta and Google Ads as complementary forces—using Meta to
push new customers into the funnel and Google to capture high-intent demand

Apply a profit-first growth strategy beyond just media buying—
advising on key e-commerce growth levers like Contribution
Margin, Cash Multiplier, CAC efficiency, AOV optimization,
and overall profitability metrics to maximize impact

Spiral USA can leverage our Paid Advertising Growth Accelerator program—a
structured system built to scale brands profitably to $5M+ in annual revenue
by turning marketing investment into predictable, measurable growth.

Beyond Ads: A Smarter
System to Profitable Growth

Most agencies focus only on running ads. We focus on turning
ad spend into predictable,  profitable growth.

Achieving sustainable e-commerce growth requires more than
just media buying—it demands a profit-first system, ensuring
every marketing dollar works as efficiently as possible. Our system
goes beyond ad management to provide strategic insights into
the key financial levers that drive long-term profitability.

W H A T   T H I S   M E A N S   F O R   Y O U :

A Profit-First Growth Framework – Understanding the key
math & metrics behind sustainable scaling (MER, LTV:CAC,
breakeven ROAS, contribution margin, cash multiplier)

Full-Funnel Optimization Strategy – Aligning how all business levers
(ads, pricing, AOV strategies, conversion rate) impact growth

Budget Allocation for Maximum Profitability – Ensuring ad
spending is structured, scalable, and directly tied to profitability

Advanced Data-Driven Insights – Beyond basic
ad reporting - leveraging real-time performance
data to make smarter business decisions

With this system-driven approach, we ensure your growth isn’t just about
spending more on ads—it’s about scaling profitably and sustainably.

Meta & Google. A Unified
Paid Advertising Strategy.

Scaling profitably isn’t about choosing one ad platform over another—it’s
about leveraging Meta and Google Ads together as complementary forces
in a push-pull strategy that drives efficiency at every stage of the funnel.

especially during peak buying periods

Insights from one platform inform optimizations on the
other, improving efficiency across both channels

M A X I M I Z I N G   P R O F I T A B I L I T Y   W I T H   M E R

Rather than focusing on platform-specific ROAS, we
take a holistic approach to paid media performance,
ensuring a sustainable MER across all channels

This unified approach to media buying ensures every
ad dollar works as efficiently as possible, driving new
customer acquisition and sustained profitability.

Month 2 - Increase to $7,500 on Meta and $7,500 on Google

Month 3 - Scale combined spend to $20,000, adjusting
based on performance and profitability opportunities
