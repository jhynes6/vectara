Service Differentiation

What makes you different from your competitors? What is your “special sauce”?
 At Upmkt Digital, we’re not just another performance marketing agency—we’re the missing link between marketing and profitability. While most agencies focus narrowly on ROAS or growth at all costs, we go deeper.
 We connect marketing and finance—unit economics, contribution margin, CAC efficiency, payback periods, and MER—so every decision we make is aligned with our clients’ bottom-line goals. We don’t just scale ad spend; we scale profitable businesses.
 We’re the bridge between creative execution and financial discipline—the strategic growth partner for founders who want to turn their marketing investment into measurable, sustainable profit.
 Think of us as the puzzle piece that’s been missing from most DTC brands’ growth teams. We sit at the intersection of marketing, analytics, and financial strategy. While other agencies talk about clicks and impressions, we’re helping our clients make confident business decisions backed by numbers that actually matter—like contribution margin and cash multiplier.

Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? What do you do to improve their business?
 “We’re spending a ton on ads, but our profit margins are shrinking.”
 “We hit a plateau—growth feels expensive and unpredictable.”
 “We’ve tried a bunch of agencies and freelancers, but no one really understands our business.”
 “I feel like I’m flying blind. I don’t know what’s actually working or why.”
 “We’re getting traffic but not enough conversions.”
 “Every month is a cash flow crunch, even though revenue looks good.”
 “We need to grow, but I’m nervous to scale spend without knowing if it’ll pay off.”
 Turns marketing chaos into a clear profit system: We help brands stop chasing vanity metrics and start scaling with precision, using a structured, P&L-aware growth strategy.
 Builds a bridge between ad spend and actual business outcomes: We align Meta and Google campaigns with real financial goals—contribution margin, CAC payback, and long-term profitability.
 Gives founders clarity and control: Through daily reporting, forecasting, and strategic insights, we make marketing performance transparent and actionable—so founders can make decisions like a CFO, not a gambler.
 Designs for efficiency, not just growth: We find leaks in the funnel, fix inefficiencies in CAC, and optimize for sustainable, scalable growth—so growth doesn’t come at the expense of cash flow.
 Acts like an extension of their leadership team: We’re not order-takers—we think like operators, not just media buyers.

Hi Stephanie - we are still working on case studies, but we've finalized more of our messaging on the profitability audit. 


I left a few comments on the first sequence, but I think we are ok to launch with these. 


At the end of the day - this profitability diagnostic/growth audit is what we are trying to offer qualified leads. 


Your Growth Has Stalled. Let’s Find Out Why. 


Uncover what’s really holding your DTC brand back from scaling profitably and get a roadmap to fix it. 


Partner Icons [Meta, Google, StoreHero, Shopify, Klaviyo]


Too many DTC brands struggle to gain real traction and achieve profitable scale, not because of their products or ads, but because the standard growth model isn’t working. Meta ads aren’t scaling profitability. Google campaigns are falling flat. Retention efforts aren’t moving the needle. 


But the real issue is deeper: most brands are unable to connect marketing decisions and platform-reported metrics to actual business profitability, and without that clarity, scaling becomes guesswork. 


And your agency doesn’t have the answers. It’s time for a new growth model. 


We’ve partnered with StoreHero to create a [growth audit] that takes a brutally honest look at your entire growth infrastructure, not just Meta or Google, and pinpoints where things are breaking down, what’s costing you profit, and how to unlock your next stage of scale.

Section: What You’ll Get


A Clear, Profit-Focused Roadmap. Delivered in 2 Weeks. 


A custom audit of your entire growth infrastructure: Meta, Google, retention, funnel, CAC, margins, and more.


Profitability insights that go beyond ROAS. See which channels are driving real returns vs. wasting spend.


Clarity on whether your paid ads are driving incremental growth or cannibalizing conversions. 


A 12-month historical analysis of the true profit impact of key decisions using StoreHero’s AI Spend Ad Advisor Tool


Visibility into the true profit of each first-time order and how that profit compounds over time.


Tactical and strategic fixes across creatives, targeting, retention, and conversion bottlenecks


A founder-friendly roadmap with prioritized next steps and forecasted outcomes


Delivered within 2 weeks, powered by StoreHero for real-time visibility into your brand’s performance


This isn’t another spreadsheet. It’s a strategic diagnosis that connects your marketing to your financial outcomes so you know exactly what to fix and why.

Section: How the Growth Audit Works


From Data to Diagnosis to Your 100-Day Growth Plan


We don’t guess, and we don’t just audit ad accounts. We consolidate your numbers, uncover the true source of profit bottlenecks, and give you a clear plan to fix them. 


Step 1: Rebuild the Numbers


We pull historical data across all key platforms, including Shopify, Meta, Google, Klaviyo, TikTok, Pinterest, and layer in variable COGS (such as shipping transaction fees) to build a clean, unified Growth P&L in StoreHero. 


Step 2: Pinpoint the Root Cause


Using your Growth P&L and macro performance trends, we conduct a root cause analysis to identify the underlying issue behind stalled growth. Is CAC too high? Are margins too thin? Is retention underperforming? We isolate what’s really blocking profitable scale. 


Step 3: Deep Dive by Channel


Once we’ve identified the root business issue, we zoom in on how each channel contributes to or holds back growth. We assess Meta, Google, email/SMS (Klaviyo), and CRO performance in the context of your business goals, not in isolated dashboards. 


Step 4: The 100-Day Plan


We translate the entire analysis into a clear, founder-friendly 100-day growth plan with tactical recommendations prioritized by impact. No fluff. Just high-leverage moves tied to forecasted outcomes, so you know exactly where to focus and how to scale profitably. 


Our goal: to replace confusion with clarity and help make smarter decisions to grow revenue and profit.
