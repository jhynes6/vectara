##### Your Agency Shows More Than 4X ROAS.  
So Why Aren't You Profitable?

# Bridge the gap between your marketing metrics and your P&L to finally understand where you're actually making (or losing) money

Too many DTC brands struggle to gain real traction and achieve profitable scale, not  
because of their products or ads, but because the standard growth model isn’t working.

##### the deeper issue

You're spending $5K+ monthly on Meta ads. Your agency reports 3-4X ROAS. But your bank account tells a different story. The truth is ROAS doesn't tell you profit—and without knowing your contribution margin, you're scaling blind.

#### Meta Shows 4X ROAS But You're Still Losing Money

#### You Have No Idea What Your True CAC Is

#### You Don't Know Your Contribution Margin (The Only Metric That Matters)

## Your Agency Doesn’t Have the Answers... It’s Time for a New Growth Model

We’ve partnered with StoreHero to create an **eCommerce Profit Health Check** that takes a brutally honest look at your entire growth infrastructure, not just Meta or Google, and pinpoints where things are breaking down, what’s costing you profit, and how to unlock your next stage of scale.

##### How the Growth Audit Works

## From Data to Diagnosis to Your 100-Day Growth Plan

We don’t guess, and we don’t just audit ad accounts. We consolidate your numbers, uncover the true source of profit bottlenecks, and give you a clear plan to fix them.

##### step one

### Rebuild the Numbers

We pull historical data across all key platforms, including Shopify, Meta, Google, Klaviyo, TikTok, Pinterest, and layer in variable COGS (such as shipping transaction fees) to build a clean, unified **Growth P&L** in StoreHero.

##### step two

### Pinpoint the Root Cause

Using your Growth P&L and macro performance trends, we conduct a root cause analysis to identify the underlying issue behind stalled growth. Is CAC too high? Are margins too thin? Is retention underperforming? We isolate what’s really blocking profitable scale.

##### step three

### Deep Dive by Channel

Once we’ve identified the root business issue, we zoom in on how each channel contributes to or holds back growth. We assess Meta, Google, email/SMS (Klaviyo), and CRO performance in the context of your business goals, not in isolated dashboards.

##### step four

### The 100-Day Plan

We translate the entire analysis into a clear, founder-friendly 100-day growth plan with tactical recommendations prioritized by impact. No fluff. Just high-leverage moves tied to forecasted outcomes, so you know exactly where to focus and how to scale profitably.

##### our goal

To replace confusion with clarity and help make smarter decisions to grow revenue and profit.

# Precision Over Guesswork

# Full-Funnel Visibility

# Profit-First Strategy

# Creative That Converts

## Rey to z

### From Losing Money at 4X ROAS to $200K/Month with 2,048% Contribution Margin Improvement

##### the challenge

ReytoZ was running Meta ads, Google ads, Klaviyo, and had recently launched a new site—but nothing felt fully connected. The founder had no visibility into **how marketing performance across platforms translated to actual profit,** and scaling any one channel felt risky without a clear, unified growth strategy.

## 7x

##### Meta ad spend

Meta ad spend scaled 7x—from $6K to $42K

## -30%

##### Overall CAC

CAC dropped to from $23.81 to $16.67

## +2,048%

##### contribution margin

Contribution margin from Meta improved by 2,048%

## +1,080%

##### Meta conversion value

Meta ad spend scaled 7x—from $6K to $42K

### Rebuild the Numbers

Through our StoreHero-powered audit, we uncovered:

*   Meta ROAS looked solid in-platform, but contribution margin was leaking due to inefficient campaign structure and low AOV
*   Google spend was under-optimized—attracting the wrong traffic and inflating CAC
*   Retention emails were mistimed and leaving money on the table
*   The site wasn’t aligned to current traffic behavior—CVR and AOV weren’t where they needed to be to support profitable scale

### What We Delivered

We rebuilt their Growth P&L inside StoreHero, then delivered a full-funnel 100-day growth plan:

*   Restructured Meta campaigns and implemented AOV-boosting offers
*   Rebuilt Google Ads targeting to reduce wasted spend and improve payback
*   Redesigned email/SMS flows to increase post-purchase retention and 60-day LTV
*   Delivered site optimizations to lift CVR and reduce friction on mobile

## “This was the first time we understood how everything fit together—ads, email, site, profit. It finally felt like we had a system for scale, not just disconnected tactics.”

##### Built for Brands Who Want to Understand the Math

#### This audit was designed for DTC founders who are tired of making marketing decisions without understanding their impact on actual business profitability.

You’ve launched campaigns, hired help, and followed the playbook. But Meta isn’t scaling profitably. Google isn’t performing. Retention isn’t lifting revenue like it should.

The problem isn’t effort—it’s visibility. You can’t fix what you can’t see. And right now, you’re missing the math.

### Not Every Brand Qualifies. Here’s Who This Is For:

We created this audit to give you the clarity and numbers you need to scale profitably, sustainably, and strategically.

#### Shopify-based DTC brand generating $25K–$250K in monthly revenue

#### Spending $5K+/month on Meta and/or Google Ads

#### Reporting a 'good' ROAS but still not profitable (or don't know if you are)

#### Looking for a smarter system to scale: beyond the typical agency playbook

## Apply now to see if you qualify for a free growth audit.

If accepted, you'll finally understand why a good ROAS isn't enough—and get the exact roadmap to help you tie every marketing dollar to your bottom line.

We only accept a limited number of audit applications each month to ensure every brand receives deep, strategic attention.
