# Spotlight on Innovation: Reimagine Data Center Switching

with Dan Radke

Pensando Product Specialist

## Introducing the CX 10000 from Aruba and AMD Pensando.

Delivering 100x the scale, 10x the performance, at one-third the TCO. Deploy advanced network and security services as close as possible to where applications are processed – at the border between the server and the network, rather than at the perimeter as in a traditional data center network architecture. With firewall, encryption, tunneling, and other services running on a distributed services switch, organizations can scale new service capabilities faster.

### Join us for our Spotlight on Innovation webinar to learn more about this breakthrough technology:

*   What makes this Pensando switch different from what’s on the market?
*   Use cases that bring the benefits of this innovation to life
*   The impact to your organization

## A Security-Focused Switch Designed to Inspect & Protect

Centralized security appliances weren’t designed to inspect and protect application traffic that is moving east-west within the data center. It’s not operationally or economically practical to deploy a suite of security appliances in every server rack. And hair-pinning traffic to an appliance sitting in a centralized services leaf comes with heavy performance and cost penalties. The Aruba CX 10000 provides an entirely new switching solution to overcome these legacy limitations.
