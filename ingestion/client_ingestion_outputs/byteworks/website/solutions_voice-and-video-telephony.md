# Voice and Video Telephony

Business still gets done by human connections that are both verbal and expressive, which makes the voice and video technology inside the business critically important. The importance factor rises with the size and scope of the organization’s human footprint.

Voice technology has continuously evolved to integrate new desk phone capability with mobile phone features, overhead paging systems, and even walkie-talkies used primarily in industrial environments. Despite the added complexity and processing overhead, the experience must be excellent. Users expect to be able to respond and initiate conversations immediately, on demand, and without any hindrance. They expect to have embedded access to contact directories and enjoy perfect call handling options.

Video communications are now expected to be available within the same set of features and in a familiar interface.

**If it were easy, everybody would have such superior business capability.**

The most appropriate solution varies for each organization. However, most organizations find a well-engineered solution includes a stable, modern on-prem video communications infrastructure to work along with hybrid systems (cloud, on-prem, or both), especially in certain sectors that have specific security and legal considerations.

Byteworks engineers are known for carefully designing and deploying modern Voice and Video Telephony systems produced by a broad range of vendors and throughout countless enterprise technology frameworks.
