# Cisco Champions 2019 – New Members!

A new year is here, and also a new year being a part of the Cisco Champion’s program! We’re super proud this year to announce we have two additional Cisco Champions on the Byteworks’ team! Both Rob Patmore and Ryan Huff, both Senior Collaboration Engineers are now a part of the Cisco Champion’s program!

Now even more of Byteworks’ engineers are represented among a select group of industry peers as a part of the Cisco Champion’s program. **Cisco Champions** are regarded as experts in Cisco products and technologies by their peers and actively share their knowledge, expertise, and thoughts in technical forums, communities, user groups, social media and speaking engagements across the social web, IRL and with Cisco. The program has been running for more than 5 years and each year open nominations are held to find and select the best candidates from around the world. We’re pleased to be once again representing our company, our region, and our industry among the best of the best and we’ll continue dedicating our energy and commitment to bringing the best technical tools and expertise to our many, multi-vertical clients. Congratulations to Rob and Ryan!
