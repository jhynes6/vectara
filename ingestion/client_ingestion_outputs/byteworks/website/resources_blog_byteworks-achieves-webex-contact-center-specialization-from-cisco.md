# Byteworks achieves Webex Contact Center Specialization from Cisco

Byteworks announced in November 2020 that the company had achieved Webex Contact Center Specialization from Cisco.

The Webex Contact Center Specialization enables select partners to sell, implement and support the Cisco Webex Contact Center offer to mid-market customers.

The Webex Contact Center accelerates the Cisco Contact Center Flexible Deployment Strategy. Combined with Ciscoâ€™s strong foundation with meetings and messaging and the acquisition of BroadSoft, the platform offers a complete collaboration portfolio with flexible deployment options (cloud, on-premise, or hybrid) to meet customer needs.
