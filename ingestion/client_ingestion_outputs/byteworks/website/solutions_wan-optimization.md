# WAN Optimization

Optimizing the speed and accuracy of data inside organizations is a mission-critical Enterprise IT assignment. Organizations depend on continuously improved, highly-performant WAN optimization software and appliances. Applications and their data depend on meeting more than an increased need of availability, they must meet the expectations of an increasingly sophisticated technology user.

WAN optimization solutions seek to perfect quality of service, compression, and application priority parameters. These solutions can be used in conjunction with SD-WAN to provide a complete optimization and healthy network for organizations branch offices.

Byteworks works with clients to identify and engineer WAN optimization solutions that improve application resiliency and network traffic.
