# Cisco Duo Unveiled: New Features

Navigating the landscape of cybersecurity requires a combination of advanced tools and expert knowledge. Byteworks, as a leader in delivering innovative technology solutions, is thrilled to unveil Cisco Duo’s new features. Our goal is to arm IT professionals with the necessary insights to bolster their organization’s security while ensuring a seamless user experience. We want to help our customers take advantage of all the new features.

### **Embracing the New: Duo Editions Reimagined**

In a move to ensure the Duo offerings are precisely aligned with user needs, the names of Duo editions have undergone a transformation:

**Duo MFA is now Duo Essentials**  
**Duo Access is now Duo Advantage**  
**Duo Beyond is now Duo Premier**

Despite these name changes, the pricing for these editions remains consistent. More importantly additional features and capabilities were added to the Essentials license that previously were only available to higher tiered editions.

### **Trusted Endpoints: Broadened Accessibility and Enhanced Security**

Trusted Endpoints feature was previously available only to users of Duo Premier; however, as a significant Duo enhancement, Trusted Endpoints is now available to Duo Essentials and Duo Advantage. This strategic expansion ensures that a wider array of organizations can now leverage this critical security feature.

Trusted Endpoints allow organizations to block access from unknown or untrusted devices, ensuring that only verified and secure devices can access critical resources. This adds an extra layer of security, protecting against potential threats and unauthorized access.

### **Proactive Security with Device Activity Notifications**

Cisco Duo now offers device activity notifications in a public preview, empowering end-users with immediate alerts for added or removed devices on their accounts. This proactive approach ensures that users can swiftly confirm changes or report any discrepancies, enhancing the organization’s security responsiveness.

### **Clarity in User Experience and Administration**

The language has been refined in the Self-Service Portal settings under Duo Single Sign-On > Duo Central in the Duo Admin Panel, ensuring a more intuitive user experience. Furthermore, administration capabilities have been broadened, allowing both Administrators and Owners to enable passwordless authentication and access reporting. Owners also gain the ability to customize their Duo Single Sign-On (SSO) subdomain, contributing to brand consistency and aiding in the identification of phishing attacks.

### **Advanced Insights With Risk-Based Authentication Reporting**

For Duo Advantage and Premier customers utilizing risk-based policies, the Authentication Log’s Trust Assessment column now provides detailed reasons for step-up authentication decisions, aiding in prompt and informed response to potential security incidents.

### **Strengthening Security With Duo Admin API Updates**

Aligning with industry best practices, we have discontinued support for server-side key generation for authenticator enrollments and removed the ability to activate older versions of Duo Mobile, bolstering our platform’s overall security.
