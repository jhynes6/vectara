## Jesse Itzler
Entrepreneur and Author

A successful serial entrepreneur, Jesse’s mission is to continually raise the bar and build his LIFE RESUME. With a passion for endurance challenges, he completed Ultraman in 2022 at the age of 53, which entails a 6.2-mile open water swim, 261.4-mile bike, and 52.4-mile run, the same year he sold his endurance hiking company, 29029 Everesting, to iFit. These things are not uncommon for Jesse, who also completed a 100-mile running race, sold Marquis Jet to Warren Buffett in 2010, and partnered with Zico Coconut Water which sold to Coca-Cola in 2013.

Jesse’s career is unlike anyone else. He started as a rapper on MTV in 1991, became the Manager of the greatest hip-hop band ever, Run-DMC, and wrote the anthem for the NY Knicks. He always says, “You don’t have to be the smartest in the room, but you have to be the most passionate.” He teaches his principles and best practices through his online course and coaching program—where thousands of people have learned from his lifestyle approach and applied it to their own.

When he’s not training with Navy Seals (check out his book, Living with A Seal) or learning from monks (check out his other book, Living with Monks), you can find him plunging in cold water and sweating in hot saunas as part of his latest venture, All Day Running Co., a brand built on the foundation of combining race-like challenges (half-marathons, marathons, etc.) with retreat-like experiences (cold and heat exposure).

At the end of the day, his proudest accomplishment is his family—with 3 sons and a daughter, he and his wife, Sara Blakely (founder of SPANX), definitely have their hands full!

## We hope to have you with us for the fun and informative event!
