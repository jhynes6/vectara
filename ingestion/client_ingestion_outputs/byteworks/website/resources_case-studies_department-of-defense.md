# Department of Defense

### **The IT Problem**

A cybersecurity and communications provider to the Department of Defense was looking for a quick turnaround on an out-of-box network solution for use in the harsh environmental conditions of the Middle East. With just 13 days to complete the project, the provider knew they had only one shot at enlisting the right partner to get it right.
