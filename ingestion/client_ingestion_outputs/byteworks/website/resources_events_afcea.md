# Creating Informed Environments Out Of Smart Cities

Smart cities and sensors are the way that cities are moving but they are limited by data working in silos alone rather than cohesively working together. Limitations of “Smart” capabilities are also “reactionary” by design…but “Informed Environments” are proactive – delivering prioritized, predictive, and complete sensor-inclusive awareness.

**In this forum, Byteworks explores collaborative data through agnostic sensors that are aggregated and synthesized with the potential for predictive analysis.**
