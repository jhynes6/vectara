# Audio, Video, and Web Conferencing

Web Conferencing, an expanded term to include Video Conferencing, refers to a set of tools and infrastructure to allow two or more people from different locations to hold a live conference over IP networks using video and audio hardware.

Consumer grade devices often bundle the hardware in a single device, such as a laptop or tablet. Commercial web conferencing offers a more flexible and capable system with reliable, managed performance that can accommodate standard consumer-grade participation.

In a video conference, a user or group of users are typically in a dedicated room with video equipment communicating with individuals or groups in a separate location but with similar video equipment. For a web conference, however, an individual connects through any computer to another individual or several, on their computers, and each user has the technical ability for active and working participation. A Webinar is a type of a web conference but structured to include much larger numbers of attendees, hundreds or thousands of them but with minimal participatory roles during the conference. Market leaders in the Web Conference or Webinar space include Cisco Webex, Zoom, Microsoft, Citrix’ GotoMeetings / GoToWebinar.

The capabilities of Web Conferencing systems and Video Conferencing systems have grown dramatically in recent years and the pandemic has given rise to a dramatic increase in adoption rates. Most vendors have combined Web and Video conferencing capabilities into a single service with robust capabilities. With Cisco Webex, for example, organizations can combine their on-prem video conferencing with their Webex Cloud services for a seamless and exceptional user experience. An employee can walk into a conference room equipped with Cisco Webex Room Kits and from their device, which can be a PC, Mac or almost any personal device or tablet, wirelessly start their scheduled Webex Conference onto the dedicated room’s screen and video conferencing equipment—with the push of a single button!

The infrastructure to support this consists of on-prem and cloud systems integrated in what is known as a “Hybrid Cloud” solution. It combines the advanced ease and features of a cloud system, with the security and reliability of an on-prem system. The engineered integration allows a competitive edge for business communication and advanced user experience. It can also enhance productivity and user satisfaction.

With its Enterprise IT Collaboration team, Byteworks helps clients engineer a Web Conferencing system to improve operations and employee communication.
