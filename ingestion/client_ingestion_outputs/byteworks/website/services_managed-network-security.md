# Managed Network Security for your Company

Byteworks managed network security services will defend your business or organization from sophisticated cyberattacks.

## Protect Your Network From Today’s Top Threats

In today’s complex network architecture with ever-expanding users, devices, locations and applications, there are constant security threats that make it challenging to keep your critical digital infrastructure protected.

Many IT teams find themselves overwhelmed with the administration and management of security across the enterprise. This is especially true for network administrators who manage large numbers of complex security tools, each with its own policies and practices. One misconfiguration can lead to network vulnerabilities.

## Firewall misconfigurations cause 99% of firewall breaches.

## What Is Network Security Management?

Managed network security management allows for centralized protection of physical and virtual firewalls. It provides visibility into the entire network from a single console that supports your network security and establishes compliance.

**Network security management provides:**

*   Simplified, collective management interface for physical and virtual systems
*   Real-time visibility into network behavior and firewall traffic
*   Automated device configuration
*   Enforcement of global policies
*   Secured network for remote sites
*   Detailed reporting for improved decision making
