# Core and Edge Routing

Customer satisfaction depends on the speed at which organizations can communicate. Core network and edge routing are critical components affecting that experience.

- Under-sizing the network core or edge router will provide a negative user experience.  
- An organization with a large remote workforce will need to implement and plan for high bandwidth routing to the Internet.

Connectivity to hyper-scale platforms (cloud) requires special consideration to core and edge routing. Data center providers that offer cloud exchange programs and cloud on-ramps are all powered by routers that must be carefully configured and routinely optimized.

Byteworks understands the cloud connectivity needs of organizations helps clients evaluate and implement the routing infrastructure best suited to their needs.
