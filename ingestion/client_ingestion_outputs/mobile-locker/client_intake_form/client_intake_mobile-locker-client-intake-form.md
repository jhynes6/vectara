Offerings

What services do you sell to your top 3 target personas? (ex. PPC, Social Content, Email Marketing) 
 We provide a content engagement platform for pharmaceutical and medical device field teams (Reps, MSLs, Field Marketing).
 It is a SaaS platform that field teams use to engage with their target clients in any channel when content is being used as a sales aid.
 Our platform ties insights to every piece of content for tracking field usage, HCP interactions (in detail) and consumption which is then delivered back to the user in real time so they can better understand their client preferences in terms of channel, format and interest so a more personalized and relevant follow uo can occur.
 We also have conferencing functionality that allows a more real-time experience at medical congresses in terms of booth engagement and visits. This permits real-time ignition of activity to CRM for swift follow-up from the appropriate individual.
 For each service, what are your top offers (packages/examples) that you would be willing to pitch them?
 More HCP engagement and access for field teams.
 Impact on brand engagement and prescribing behaviors.\
 Deep consumption insights for field marketing (content creators) to better define messaging that is impacting and being used by the field. 
 Our clients gain more access, brand engagement, and ultimately more revenue from each targeted HCP.

Service Differentiation

What makes you different from your competitors? What is your “special sauce”?
 Main competitor is a “component/module” inside Veeva CRM.
 Our offering delivers:
 Speed and velocity to value.
 Exponentially faster to deploy and integrate.
 Insights are real-time and much deeper and more comprehensive than the alternatives.
 Value play as we tend to be anywhere from ⅓ ot ¼ of the price of the others when you factor, license, deployment, training and support.
 We win on simplicity and tangible value for reps. They see the impact near immediately.
 Can be fully deployed in days.

Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? What do you do to improve their business?
 Reps are struggling with access to HCP targets.
 Lack of visibility into what content assets are being utilized and are effective.
 Too many field tools for different HCP channels make it hard to consolidate insights.
 No ability to track specific consumption and engagement with shared content.
 Field leadership lacks access to best practice insights into which reps are most active and effective in their engagement cadence.
 Gathering insights and booth activity at Conferences and Congresses is slow, manual and cumbersome.What is Medical Affairs?https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_c97ddcfe-30d7-45b1-9ce4-72c4b6f5506f
 How do MSLs engage with HCPs out in the field? https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_6222350f-c315-43bc-b770-2bd1b98ab0d1
 Competitor CRM/HCP engagement tool: “Veeva”Veeva CRM is currently built on top of Salesforce. But they are "divorcing" from Salesforce and every pharma company is evaluating whether to migrate to Veeva's new "Vault CRM", or to Salesforce's new "Life Sciences Cloud" CRM.
 Both will require huge investments.
 Both have HCP engagement, but neither does it well
 We are the third alternative and can integrate with both CRMs so reps can keep working regardless of the CRM platform their company selects.Search LinkedIn for "Veeva Salesforce" - you'll see a lot of people talking about the divorce and the potential impact to pharma companies about making the decision.Veeva/Salesforce links from LinkedIn:

Case Studies and Previous Customer Successes

For each service, what are case studies or recent customer successes that you use to highlight your expertise in your field?
 Will share some slides on this but generally:
 20% increase in HCP meetings.
 19% increase in prescription activity from HCPs targeted with Mobile Locker. (Revenue.)
 The capacity to demonstrate specifics tied to what messages are being consumed and which ones are NOT, for more precision in content creation.
 Best practice identification as to what the most successful reps are doing, so those behaviors can be identified and shared.  All reps get better…high tides lift all boats.https://app.mobilelocker.com/shared/mobile-locker-introExample med device/diagnostic client:
