# Marketing and Sales Terms Every Professional Should Know

Marketing and sales professionals use a LOT of acronyms and other terms that can be hard to understand. Here are some of the most common along with clear and simple definitions of what they mean.

## ABC

An acronym for **always be closing**, this refers to an old-school sales strategy that requires sales reps to focus on closing the deal throughout the sales process. The concept is antiquated because it takes their attention away from meeting the needs of the buyer, which is critical in today’s selling environment. Nowadays, _always be closing_ has been replaced by _always be connecting_.

## Adoption process

This is another term for _buying process_. It includes all the steps prospects go through on the way to making purchases.

## AIDA

This acronym stands for **Awareness**, **Interest**, **Desire**, **Action**. These are the four steps of the old-school purchase funnel, which moves customers from initial awareness to finally taking action. The purchase funnel isn’t used much anymore because a sales process that includes digital and social elements is less linear and far more complex and varied.

## Awareness

This is the stage in the buying process when people become aware of a product or service that could satisfy their needs.

## Benefit

The value a product or service provides to consumers.

## BANT

This acronym represents a process salespeople go through to determine if a prospect has the **budget**, **authority**, **need** and **timeline** to actually buy something.

## BOFU

Another acronym. It stands for **bottom** **of** the **funnel**, which represents the final stage of the buying process prior to closing sales.

## Buyer Behavior

This is the process a consumer goes through to identify, consider and select products and services that meet their needs.

## Buying Process

The end-to-end process potential purchasers go through before deciding whether they want to buy something.

## Buying Signal

A sign from a prospect that indicates they’re ready to buy something. This could be a question like, _“When can this be delivered to me?”_

## CAC

The **customer** **acquisition** **cost** is the total amount marketing and sales has to spend to close a deal. It is often a measure of sales efficiency. Over time, using a sound sales enablement process and system can lower CAC.

## Churn

A statistic that explains how many customers are lost versus those retained. A high churn rate usually indicates poor customer service.

## Closed-Won

A sales opportunity that ends with a deal.

## Closed-Lost

A sales opportunity that ends without a purchase.

## Commission
