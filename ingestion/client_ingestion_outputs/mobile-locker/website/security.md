## Security and Privacy

## Some of the steps we take to ensure your security include

We’re committed to keeping your data secure and your private information private. If you have any questions, please contact us.

**Third Party Testing**  
Mobile Locker hires an external company annually for penetration and security testing. Our test reports are available to current and prospective customers. Please contact us at security@mobilelocker.com.

**Encryption At-Rest**  
All databases and disk volumes are encrypted using  AWS KMS (FIPS 140-2 validated) and the industry-standard AES-256 algorithm.

**Encryption In-Transit**  
All communications with Mobile Locker services and APIs use Transport Layer Security (TLS 1.3 or later) for secure connections. There is no non-­TLS option for connecting to Mobile Locker. View our [Qualys SSL Labs Report](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=app.mobilelocker.com&hideResults=on&latest).

**Encrypted Backups**  
All customer data is continuously backed up in an encrypted format, with point-in-time recovery and daily snapshots. We validate our data recovery procedures regularly as part of our business continuity and disaster recovery processes.

**Encryption Keys**  
All Mobile Locker encryption keys are stored in FIPS 140-2 validated hardware security modules managed by Amazon.

**Privacy and Confidentiality**  
No Mobile Locker staff will access your data unless required for support reasons. When working on a support issue, we only access the minimum data needed to resolve your issue while respecting your privacy. Access to data is restricted by job function and monitored.

**Access Controls**  
All the data, such as your files, is by default private and only accessible by you. If you explicitly share something with someone else, you can always revoke the access later.

**Single Sign-On**  
Optional SSO support (OAuth and SAML) is available for Google, Salesforce, Microsoft, Okta, Ping, Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS), Azure AD, and others.

**Secure Authentication**  
All user passwords are are stored salted and hashed (using bcrypt) and cannot be recovered by Mobile Locker staff. When using a single sign-on account to access Mobile Locker, no user credentials are stored by Mobile Locker. Optional Two-Factor Authentication (2FA/MFA) support is available for an additional layer for protection of your account.

**Data Centers**  
The Mobile Locker service is hosted in AWS’s highly secure data centers (ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, SOC 1 certified). We have separate instances in the **us-east-1 (Virginia)** and **eu-west-1 (Ireland)** availability zones.

**Secure Configuration Management**  
Mobile Locker uses code reviews, automated testing, and deployments, with servers continuously updated with the latest security errata.
