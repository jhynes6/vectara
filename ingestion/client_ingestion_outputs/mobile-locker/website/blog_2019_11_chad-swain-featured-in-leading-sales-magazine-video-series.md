# Chad Swain Featured in Leading Sales Magazine Video Series

[Selling Power](https://www.sellingpower.com) is the leading online magazine and information source for sales leaders since 1981. It provides broad and deep information about how to sell better â€” and manage sales teams more effectively.

One of the highlights of the content offered by Selling Power is a popular series of five-minute videos. Experts in the sales industry are interviewed by Gerhard Gschwandtner, Founder and CEO of Selling Power. He has interviewed some of the most successful leaders in sales, business, sports, entertainment and politics.
