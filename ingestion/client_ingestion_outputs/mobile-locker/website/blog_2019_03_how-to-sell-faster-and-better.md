# How to Sell Faster and Better

Many salespeople think it’s okay for deals to take time to close. After all, a sale is a sale is a sale — and whatever it takes to make one happen is worth it.  
**The truth:** No one wants a _slow-closing deal._

In all but a few industries, typically those selling high ticket products and services, most businesses cannot afford the time and effort it takes to support long sales cycles.  
If you do the math, you’ll soon realize that it probably makes more financial sense for your business to close a larger number of deals quickly than to waste time on sales that take too long.

Many organizations turn to sales enablement to make their sales process more efficient. Here’s how it could help you close more deals faster, while improving the profitability of each one.

## Find the best opportunities

Sales enablement provides the data needed to identify the “sweet spot” for your sales organization — the opportunities that are most likely to close in a reasonable amount of time, while delivering the best bottom line benefits for your company.  
_A sales enablement program may take time and effort to implement, but it will quickly pay off in wasting less time pursuing bad deals._

## Identify the right messages and materials in less time

Sales enablement provides the information required to find the messages and sales support materials that connect with consumers. It helps you figure out what your reps should say and do to get prospects to take action.  
_It’s true, a sales enablement program will help you identify what materials you need share to speed the process of completing sales._

## Train on sales best practices

Once you know the best way to close deals efficiently, sales enablement makes it easy to spread the word. You can share best practices with your whole sales team through training programs your reps can access any place and any time.  
_Knowledge is power. Sales enablement transfers it across your organization._

## Speed proposal development

Some deals are simple. Others are far more complex.

_Sales enablement processes and software provide sales teams with the ability to communicate and transfer information so you can generate better pitches and proposals and get them to prospects faster than your competitors._
