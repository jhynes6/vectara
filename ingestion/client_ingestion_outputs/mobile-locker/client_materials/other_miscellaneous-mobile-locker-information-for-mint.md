Hi Jonathan.

I hope you are well. I have been working for some time to pique your interest in a meeting,
primarily via our LinkedIn connection.

Here at Mobile Locker, we help nearly 50 pharma and life sciences clients gain more consistent
HCP access and bi-directional engagement through real-time insights gathered and shared
back from content consumption.

In short, we provide reps with eyes and ears in the moment, each time an HCP engages with a
shared piece of content (in any channel and format).
The deep consumption insights are shared back in real time, allowing the rep, MSL, or field
marketing team to take advantage of the power to know exactly what is on the mind of that HCP,
allowing unprecedented personalization and relevance in their next engagement.



---

Our clients report more HCP access, more relevant engagement and ultimately an impact on
prescribing behaviors.

We encourage and execute no-risk pilots at our cost.
In fact, one of our largest clients experienced a 19% lift in prescriptions from HCPs they used
Mobile Locker to target over their short pilot period.
They are now one of our largest clients.

Please suggest a 30-minute window if you would like to share a brief exploratory discussion.
I am confident that you will find the time productive and a half hour extremely well spent.
Who knows, it might be the 30 minutes that leads to a double-digit increase in sales?

Thank you in advance for the thoughtful consideration.

I look forward to your response.
Have a great day.
