 “Online Presence Audit”/”Brand Presence Audit”?
 Sample Messaging:
 Organic social media is great for engaging your current audience—but growing your business means reaching beyond the people who already know you. That takes a clear, strategic approach. There are three core actions every brand should take to expand reach, build credibility, and turn visibility into revenue. Our Online Presence Blueprint gives you a high-level look at how your brand is showing up online—and where you’re missing opportunities to grow your audience, increase sales, and strengthen your market position.
 Cold Email Example:
 Hi [First Name],
 I took a quick look at your brand channels and saw a lot of potential—but also a few areas where you might be leaving visibility (and sales) on the table.
 Want a free brand assessment? It’s a high-level audit that shows where your brand could show up stronger online—and exactly how to start reaching more of the right audience.
 If you're open to it, I can send it your way this week. Just let me know.
 Best,
 Gabrielle

Service Differentiation

What makes you different from your competitors? What is your “special sauce”?
 (ex: We implement 8 proprietary flows to maximally engage customers via email. 14 touch-points across a 30 day visit to our customers site has been proven to concert the highest % of site visits to paying and repeat customers)
 1. Organic-First Growth Most agencies lean heavily on ads to show “fast results,” but we know sustainable growth starts with organic. Our team builds your brand story from the ground up through content, community, and strategy—so your presence feels natural, authentic, and lasting.
 2. Smart, Not Heavy, Paid Strategy Instead of overwhelming budgets with ads, we use small, highly targeted paid campaigns to amplify what’s already working organically. That means lower ad spend, higher ROI, and a constant feedback loop that shows you exactly what content converts.
 3. Boutique, Collaborative Approach We’re not a mass-produced agency. Terra Collective feels like an extension of your team—immersed in your brand voice, goals, and audience—so every piece of content feels intentional and aligned.
 4. The Authority Funnel Our proprietary system (Experience Ad, Brand Ad, Retargeting Stories) is designed to create awareness, establish trust, and drive action. This layered approach helps your brand grow consistently without the waste of scattershot advertising.
 5. Ultimate Growth Through Balance The synergy of organic foundations + small paid components creates compounding growth: organic builds trust, paid boosts reach, and together they deliver scalable, measurable success that competitors can’t match.
 At Terra Collective, we don’t believe in growth that burns out. We believe in building sustainable brands. That’s why we lead with organic content to cultivate trust, then use small, strategic paid campaigns to amplify results. The outcome? Marketing that feels authentic, performs with precision, and scales with confidence.

Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? What do you do to improve their business?
 (ex: My clothing line has stopped reaching new buyers and we want to break into a new niche. Facebook keeps getting more expensive and makes it hard to target new buyers.
 Solution: Organic UGC content is the perfect mechanism to branch out to new customers. We help you find influencers who are exactly like your target audience, work with them to create videos and then use those videos to penetrate your new niche audience.)
 1. Lack of Time + Expertise
 Business owners and developers know social media is crucial but don’t have the time or skillset to do it consistently.
 They get stuck in the weeds (posting inconsistently, not knowing trends, not understanding algorithms).
 2. Content Overwhelm
 They don’t know what to post, how often, or what will actually convert.
 Their feeds feel messy, off-brand, or disconnected from their real business goals.
 3. No Clear Strategy
 Many have tried freelancers or in-house staff who just “post to post” without tying efforts to ROI.
 They feel like their marketing is guesswork, not part of a bigger plan.
 4. Poor ROI from Paid Ads
 Competitors or DIY attempts have led to wasted ad spend.
 They’re frustrated with agencies that push heavy ad budgets without showing clear returns.
 5. Brand Voice + Storytelling Struggles
 They can’t figure out how to differentiate themselves in a crowded market.
 They need help translating their unique story, values, and lifestyle into content that connects.
 6. Inconsistent Growth
 They may see bursts of engagement but no steady growth.
 Followers aren’t turning into real leads, bookings, or sales.
 7. Too Many Hats to Wear
 For developers, builders, designers, or venue owners—their main focus is on building, designing, or serving clients. Marketing feels like a distraction from what they’re best at.
 8. Fear of Falling Behind
 Competitors are growing faster on social.
 They feel pressure to keep up but don’t know how.
 How Terra Collective Solves These
 Organic-first strategies that save clients from wasting money on ads that don’t convert.
 Content blueprints + Authority Funnel to turn social into a lead-generating machine.
 Seamless extension of their team so they don’t have to juggle marketing themselves.
 Boutique, high-touch approach that makes them feel seen and supported—not just another account in a big agency.
