## The problem

The Beechwood Organization, a leading privately-owned home builder in the U.S., expanded into North Carolina with their new community, Lakeside Pointe. Despite their national reputation, they had no local presence in this new market. The challenge was to establish a recognizable brand in the region, highlight the lifestyle and community aspects, and showcase their architectural partnerships.

## Our solution:

We developed a comprehensive social media strategy focusing on…

Establishing Brand Recognition: Creating content that emphasizes Beechwood’s commitment to quality, thoughtful design, and harmony with nature to build brand identity in the new region.

### 01

Showcasing Lifestyle and Community: Highlighting the unique lifestyle and community aspects of Lakeside Pointe to attract potential buyers.
