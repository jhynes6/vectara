 From a content strategy perspective; stating that we can get you from nothing to something - quickly and effectively:
 In 6 weeks, we hand-delivered a 3-month content strategy ready to launch that included 2-3 weekly IG posts, with a coordinated ad strategy plan.
 We helped Jefferson Avenue Insurance develop a social media strategy that increased its reach by 114% and link clicks by 154%. 
 We helped PreventEd create consistent and strategic content maps to broaden brand awareness and campaign engagement, leading to increased engagement and inquiries.
 Short-term (3-6 months)
 Follower Growth: 25% increase on Instagram.
 Engagement Rate: Improvement from 1% to 3% on all relevant platforms.
 Website Traffic: 30% increase from social media referrals.
 Summary: PreventEd is a regional non-profit focusing on a niche audience. The ongoing engagement structure includes monthly strategy deliverables, metric analytics, and continuous content strategy optimizations to maintain and enhance audience interaction. Their first quarter social media strategy emphasized engagement, community building, and driving clicks back to their website in an effort to learn audience preferences and behavior while still showing measurable improvements on key metrics. 
 Long-term (6-12 months)
 Follower Growth: 40% increase on Instagram.
 Engagement Rate: Reach and maintain high end of industry standard 4-5% on all relevant platforms.
 Summary: After three months of diligent analysis, LIB successfully identified the key parameters, behaviors, and content preferences of the audience. With this valuable information, we strategically shifted our focus each month towards maximizing reach. Put simply, once we understood what resonated most with our primary audience, we concentrated our efforts on exposing more people to that content.

Service Differentiation

What makes you different from your competitors? What is your “special sauce”?
 (ex: We implement 8 proprietary flows to maximally engage customers via email. 14 touch-points across a 30 day visit to our customers site has been proven to concert the highest % of site visits to paying and repeat customers)
 Personalized Service: As the owners and account managers, we are directly involved in every aspect of your project. We don’t pass off the work to others. You’ll work directly with us, ensuring a deep understanding of your business and a personal touch in all we do.
 Expert-Driven Empowerment: While you know your business, we bring the social media expertise. We develop a plug-and-play strategy that empowers you to manage your social media effectively without needing to budget for ongoing monthly expenses, train new staff, or stay on top of constantly evolving social media trends.
 Flexible and Risk-Free: We offer a no-commitment, risk-free approach. Opt for a one-off, personalized strategy to implement and see the results. You can return to us for quarterly refreshers a-la-carte or monthly strategy optimizations for ongoing support. We provide solutions tailored to your organization, budget and goals, allowing you to take control of your social media at your own pace.

Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? What do you do to improve their business?
 (ex: My clothing line has stopped reaching new buyers and we want to break into a new niche. Facebook keeps getting more expensive and makes it hard to target new buyers.
 Solution: Organic UGC content is the perfect mechanism to branch out to new customers. We help you find influencers who are exactly like your target audience, work with them to create videos and then use those videos to penetrate your new niche audience.)
 Resource Constraints: Business owners recognize the importance of social media but often lack the resources to hire or regularly consult with experts, leaving their social media efforts under-supported.
 Time and Expertise Challenges: Social media requires its own dedicated strategy, which can be too time-consuming for existing marketing teams. The rapid pace of social media changes makes it difficult for businesses to stay current and adapt strategies effectively.
 Lack of Structured Approach: Many businesses struggle to analyze social media metrics and keep up with industry trends, leading to a passive approach. Without the time or expertise to establish a proper structure, their social media efforts often fall short of their potential.
