[From ELIZA to Parlant: The Evolution of Conversational AI Systems and Paradigms](/blog/evolution-of-conversational-ai)

Conversational AI has evolved dramatically over decades. From rule-based chatbots like ELIZA in the 1960s, through hybrid ML+rule frameworks, and, recently, LLMs. Now, state-of-the-art Conversation Modeling engines marry the generative power of LLMs with structured guidelines, allowing richer interactions that remain controllable, easier to develop iteratively, and more scalable to test in real-world scenarios.

[Why Generic RAG Frameworks Can't Catch On](/blog/generic-rag-will-never-catch-on)

In the market for generic RAG frameworks, the different providers are fighting over who can provide 67% accuracy versus 65%. And when you run an off-the-shelf RAG framework on your use case, it will end up closer to 50% accuracy. Is this the best that the industry can do?
