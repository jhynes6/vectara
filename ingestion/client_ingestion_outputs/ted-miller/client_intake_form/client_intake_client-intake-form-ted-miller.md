Campaign Criteria

Targeting

Describe your top three target personas (clients): 
 I have an entire document that speaks to my avatar energy, let alone demographic and psychographic. 
 Small business owners with 10-200 employees, under $125MM/year in revenue, typically at $30,000,000 or $10,000,000 USD in annual revenue plateau.
 John Miller• Male• 59 years old, facing a birthday with a zero at the end (range 49 - 69 years old)• Hometown of Chicago, IL• Refers to himself as a business owner, President, entrepreneur, business operator and CEO• $30,000,000 or $10,000,000 USD in revenue plateau• 100 employees• 10 years in business• Annual personal income of $750,000• Hyper focused on his business, all consuming to the point that it may even be their hobby. They go to events, read, watch to learn how to grow an even better company.• A logical person but not analytical, and still in tune to emotional components• Introverted but learned to be gregarious• Generally happy• Divorced because he was a workaholic at 100 hours a week, happily re married with children living in the suburban areas.• White collar but was blue collar originally• Habit - Desire to get to the next level in their business, willing to commit to do the work as long as it heads his in the direction of his long term goal
 Are there industries you won’t sell to? 
 (ex. Health Care, Law Firms, Franchises)
 Yes, I have a “Not List” for LinkedIn, like Not Vice President, Not Non for profit, Not Manager, Not Hospital, 

Offerings

What services do you sell to your top 3 target personas? (ex. PPC, Social Content, Email Marketing) 
 Marketing to get enough IDEAL prospects
 Sales to generate enough revenue
 Management to optimize teams performance
 For each service, what are your top offers (packages/examples) that you would be willing to pitch them?
 The UBBE workshop is sold for $250 is 2.5 hours and with only 12 business owners. They will learn the 1st, 2nd and 3rd most important things to get their business to where they want it to be. The outcome will be defined as a Breakthrough, something to help them be 2 - 10x more effective than they are now.
 If they want the outcome and they are willing to invest now, they can invest $5,000 to get 12 Live Training and 12 Mentorship sessions + 4x 1 on 1 Coaching sessions + resource library.

Cost of Services

What is your average order value? What are your “Starting At” costs for your services?
 They pay $250 to learn a strategy to solve their problem...sell that. If you sell the "High Ticket" you are too tactical, too salesy .They will invest $5,000 to get the outcome.$30,000 to have a year of improvement$250,000 for those who transformed!

Service Differentiation

What makes you different from your competitors? What is your “special sauce”?
 We help them better implement proven business growth strategies. Read that again IMPLEMENT, execute more effectively is what we assist in and the 12 impacts areas found in the HeArt of Business is where we focus.
 TPA- proprietary process to help them create momentum by learning "How to WORK ON their business by getting all people involved (Kaizen)" The Focus on the HeArt of Business, meaning virtue based decisions that drive a business, Character First, not Boobs, Muscles, and empty promises, rather 23+ years with 25,000 clients and informed by titans in business via previous partnerships like Jay Abraham, Tony Robbins, Chet Holmes,Jay Conrad Levinson, Keving Harrington, Robert Allen etc…
 On the other side you find the "Wolf of Wallstreet", Jordan Belford, he still owes $100MM to those he stole from and served time in jail for his ponzi scheme, yet he trains entrepreneurs on growing their businesses. 

Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? What do you do to improve their business?
 I don't have enough time, I don't have enough money.
 I need to improve management so the business can run and grow more without me. I am still tied into the business, even after a decade. I have a good management team but they are not great, or they don’t have what it takes to get the business to the next level.We need to improve our sales in order to hit our revenue goals. I am the best sales person in the company. I have some salespeople, 1 is good, might be able to become a star, but the rest are weaker reps. They eat up the very expensive leads, they don’t seem to close deals I would.We need to improve marketing so we can drive growth (increase revenue) and/or drive profitability (targeting IDEAL clients). Poor growth of revenue is preventing us from reinvesting in our business … so we are stuck in legacy technology, lack investment in training staff, preventing them from being proactive to "work on it." Poor profits keep us from the freedom we desired when they started this company, travel with my wife, spend time with grandkids, get into golf (hobby of choice) 

Case Studies and Previous Customer Successes

For each service, what are case studies or recent customer successes that you use to highlight your expertise in your field?

 Covenant Eyes $5MM to $35MM with a profitable exit.
