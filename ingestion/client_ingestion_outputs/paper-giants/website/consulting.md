****Paper Giants**** will offer the opportunity for each client to share any products and services already provided with an organization of their choosing free of charge, for as long as a binding contract with the client is in effect.

This not only rewards clients but instills a culture of generosity that ultimately could result in those organizations one day becoming clients and passing along the same benefit to another up-and-coming organization in their community.
