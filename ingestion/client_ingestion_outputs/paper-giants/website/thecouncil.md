## What is the Council?

The Council is a Kingdom-minded two-day experience that breathes new life, begins new friendships, and builds new content for pastors â€“ giving every church represented margin for more ministry all year long.

## Event Details

### Transportation Info

If arriving by car, we will provide you with an address to the site.

If arriving by plane, you will need to get an Uber ride to and from the airport. Most pastors share rides back to the airport!

### Schedule

Complete schedules will be emailed out to those that register closer to the event.

Check-in time is 4:00pm on Monday.

Check-out time is 10:00am on Thursday.

### What are the differences between the two events?

Both retreats will include time for pastors to rest, recharge, learn from some leading ministry-supporting experts and make lasting relationships with other pastors.

The **Grand Rapids retreat** is focused more for those pastors wanting to be a part of sermon series ideating. Sermon series worked on at this retreat will be eventually made into series for the Sunday Storytellers library!

The **Destin retreat** is focused more on rest and recharging. Pastors attending will have a chance to experience Renewal Nights at Destiny Worship Center during each evening.
