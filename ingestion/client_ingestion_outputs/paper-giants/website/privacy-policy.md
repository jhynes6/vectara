**9.02**     **Online Advertising**.  We are not an advertising-supported website, but do advertise certain third party products.  It is possible that a visit to our Website will expose you to advertising. Some of the third party products we advertise participate in ad networks on their own site, and may use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. We do not permit our ad serving partners to collect personal information about you on our Website. Rather, we provide them Non-Personal Information about you such as the types of reviews you have posted or the products and services you have searched for.

**ARTICLE XI**

**SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION**

Paper Giants implements reasonable administrative, technical and physical security measures to protect the security of your Personal Information both online and offline, and we are committed to the protection of customer information. In general, our business practices limit employee access to confidential information to those employees we reasonably believe need such information to do their jobs.

Your Paper Giants Account information is protected by the password you use to access your online account. It is important that you protect and maintain the security of your Paper Giants Account and that you immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your Paper Giants Account.

However, while we take reasonable precautions against possible security breaches of the Website and our customer databases and records, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. We urge you to take steps to keep your Personal Information safe (including your Paper Giants Account password), and log out of your Paper Giants Account after each use.
