# How to Party According to the Bible

**_Hot Takes_** __are student-written reviews of relevant books (especially books in the library of the Bible), movies, video games, shows, events, technology, and anything interesting or important to students (13-17 years of age). Usually light-hearted, each piece is all about developing a Biblical worldview, increasing Biblical literacy, and supplementing student ministries.__

If you think the Bible is all rules and ancient history, hold onto your party hats. It turns out, God and His people know how to throw a party, and some aren’t small deals at all! We’re talking major celebrations with deep meanings. Here’s just some of the parties and party people in the Bible and what they can teach us about celebrating in our own lives.

**1. God Loves a Good Party!**  
God commands us to party! Take the **Feast of Passover (Exodus 12:14-17)**, celebrating a massive escape from slavery, or **Pentecost**, marking the first harvest and later, the arrival of the Holy Spirit to the disciples **(Acts 2)**. Then there’s the **Feast of Tabernacles (Leviticus 23)**, where everyone lives in makeshift huts to remember their wilderness journey. These aren’t just random parties; they are full-on festivals with food, singing, and reminders of some pretty incredible moments from their history.

**2. Weddings and Winning Dance Moves**  
Jump to scenes like the **wedding at Cana (John 2)**, where Jesus turns water into wine, keeping the celebration going when the hosts run low—easily the coolest party trick ever. Then there’s King David, who dances with so much energy when bringing the Ark of the Covenant back home that he embarrassed himself **(2 Samuel 6)**. These stories tell us that big moments—whether wedding or winning—deserve big parties.

**3. MC Jesus (Master of Celebrations)**  
Jesus Himself is all about parables that featured feasts, showing that the Kingdom of Heaven is like a grand party **(Luke 14-15)**. He is even criticized for partying and hanging out with people who are considered outcasts **(Matthew 9:9-12).** This shows us that celebrations are meant to include everyone and can happen even in unexpected places**.**

**4. Party Vibes in the Early Church**  
Early Christians described in Acts don’t just meet once in a while; they get together and share meals and moments every day with genuine joy **(Acts 2:46-47)**. Their lives are a continuous celebration of their faith, showing us that being joyful doesn’t need a special occasion—it can be part of everyday life.

> **But, what about when the party stops?**

Even the tough moments, like the battle of Ai, have a tone relief and victory, like when Joshua displays the defeated king like a victory trophy over fear **(Joshua 8:29)**. It’s a bit intense, but overcoming big challenges—whether external battles or internal struggles—are cause for reflection and, yes, even celebration.

> **What victory do you need to celebrate?**

Think about your own life. Passed a test? Made up with a friend after a big fight? Each win, no matter how small, is your moment to pause, reflect, and maybe even celebrate. It’s about recognizing what God’s up to in your life, what’s going right, and learning from your battles, just like those stories from long ago.

Life isn’t just about the struggles; it’s also about stopping and giving the moments of joy and victory the room they need to cut loose and celebrate. So next time something good happens, no matter how small, take a moment to throw a little party—it’s practically biblical!
