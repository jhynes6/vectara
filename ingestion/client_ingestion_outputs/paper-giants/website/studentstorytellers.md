## Why get help from Paper Giants with sermons when I write my own?

These aren’t sermon scripts. These are pages of possibility to help ignite your weekly time of studying and preparing fresh messages filled with illustrations, storytelling, and Scripture-based narratives and steps to take for any listener.

All the content provided is specifically designed to help pastors study and prepare their God-given messages. Paper Giants gives pastors more relevant, practical, and story-based content than they will ever find anywhere else.

## How is Paper Giant’s content different than all the content that is already out there?

With over 50 years of practical ministry and sermon experience from dozens of writers with decades of seminary education and training, Paper Giants content stands apart from all the other content (including AI-based and free).

Don’t take our word for it, ask for a sample and see for yourself. 

## How well does Paper Giants content work with an already established creative team, student team, or kids teams?

Whether your church team is full-time, part-time, or spare-time, Paper Giants content is designed to share with unlimited users at your church and all documents can be shared, shaped, downloaded, edited, or changed to suit their needs and styles.

Not only is the content designed by current and former church staffers and volunteers, but it is designed for church staffers and volunteers. Planning and preparing for Sundays, Students, and Kids has never been this far ahead.

## How much does it cost to partner with Paper Giants?

There are two kinds of Paper Giant’s partners: partners who can afford the support and partners who can’t—and both get it.
