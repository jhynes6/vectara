#### Mission & Message

**From capturing the origin story, to defining vision, mission and values, to identifying and reaching clients.**

## What’s Your Origin Story?

It’s important now more than ever to stand apart from the field, and one of the best ways to do this is by preserving and sharing the story of why you or your organization began.

Let us help you capture the history of your organization and release the power of the founder’s first passions for all your clients and organizational teams to see.

This is a perfect product and solution-sized service for opportunities like:

###### Organizational Anniversaries

###### Capital Campaigns

###### Team Development

## What Are You Doing & Why Does it Matter?

Every organization has a vision and mission statement and most have values defining the desired culture plastered to their walls and websites. So why do only some companies get the desired results?

Sure, those organizations typically use the expertise of an expensive agency. But Paper Giants can help you unlock the secrets of a compelling calling and **Culture Content Strategy**.

This is a perfect product and solution-sized service for opportunities like:

###### Organizational Branding or Rebranding

###### Executive Trainings or Retreats

## How Will They Know?

Listen, we all have a nephew or a friend who knows about social media. Some of us even have a minor in advertising or pay a staffer who dabbles in marketing. Maybe that’s why you’re not seeing any results.

Let us take a load off your shoulders and keep you from having another hard conversation about disappointing results in your **Digital Marketing and Messaging**.

This is a perfect product and solution-sized service for opportunities like digital marketing for all major social media platforms.

****Paper Giants**** will offer the opportunity for each client to share any products and services already provided with an organization of their choosing free of charge, for as long as a binding contract with the client is in effect.

This not only rewards clients but instills a culture of generosity that ultimately could result in those organizations one day becoming clients and passing along the same benefit to another up-and-coming organization in their community.

## We’re Better Together

Whether you have a simple question or are ready to get started slaying the giants in your way, let us know who you are and we’ll be in touch!
