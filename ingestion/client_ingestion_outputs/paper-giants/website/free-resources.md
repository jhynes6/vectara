Dec 8, 2023 | [Church Help](https://papergiants.tv/category/church-help/)

“Joy to the World” is the most- published Christmas hymn in North America. But, despite how well it suits the Christmas season, it wasn’t originally meant for Christmas.

In 1779, a collection of 348 poems called the Olney Hymns was published. These hymns were not set to music like the ones we are familiar with today. Rather, they were a collection of verses that could be sung or chanted to nearly any tune, even that of a pub song. They were written by two men who struggled with dark pasts and depression, and this is their story.

Across the digital and personal landscape of conversations, the plooms of smoke rising from the attacks and fires started by careless, reckless, and violent words are only making matters worse. What exactly is the wise thing to say about the terrible tragedies unfolding in Gaza and Israel right now and other tough issues our world is facing?

## [Lost and Found in Translation: The Power of Biblical Storytelling](https://papergiants.tv/lost-and-found-in-translation-the-power-of-biblical-storytelling/)

Most good stories have a turn — a moment that subverts your expectations. A moment that surprises you. If I’m honest, I had stopped viewing the Bible as a good story. It was familiar. Rote. My devotional, a daily chore. But sitting on the ground with those women that day, steaming cups of chai in between us, my view of that story changed.

Sure, branding is a corporate, business world term, but at its heart, branding is simply storytelling. It’s sharing with others who you are, what you do, and what you care about. It is those little details, those connection points that will help someone decide whether they ever want to walk through your doors or be a part of your church.

Some are leaving for other denominations, while others are leaving the Church and their faith altogether. The dissonance many are feeling between their personal beliefs and the beliefs of the Church are causing them to ask the question — Is this where I want to be? Do I still believe in what my church claims to stand for?
