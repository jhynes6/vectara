# God’s 7-Day Challenge or a Cosmic Riddle?

**_Hot Takes_** __are student-written reviews of relevant books (especially books in the library of the Bible), movies, shows, events, technology, and anything interesting or important to students (13-17 years of age). Usually light-hearted, each piece is all about developing a Biblical worldview, increasing Biblical literacy, and supplementing student ministries.__

How was the universe actually created… in the beginning?

Was it a Big Bang or God’s masterful design in just seven days? One thing is for sure, the Creation Story is an intergalactic story that’s as boundless as it is beautiful. Some people read these chapters through the telescopic lens of an epic poem, seeing a universe painted with words that tells us less about science and more about the power and creativity of a Creator.

Others wonder,  
“Does this clash with everything we’ve learned in science class?”

> **But, what if the first two chapters of Genesis are not about choosing between religion and science at all?**

In Genesis, we get this astronomical image of God shaping the world, crafting stars and oceans, plants and animals, all in a 7-day cosmic crafting challenge. It’s an ancient story with more swag than a superhero origin tale.

But what does it mean to say God created the world in six days (and took a well-deserved break on the seventh)?

Are the “days” real 24-hour days, or something more metaphorical?

And how does this ancient text vibe with modern theories like the Big Bang and evolution?

Here’s the thing: the Creation Story is not a scientific textbook, but something even cooler. It is a way of thinking about who we are, why we’re here, and what makes this universe such a stellar place to live in.

> **It’s a story that asks us to think big and ask the ultimate ‘what if?’ questions.**

So, is Genesis 1-2 a science lesson? Probably not.

Is it a fascinating, thought-provoking story moving at the speed of light that challenges us to think beyond the horizon? Absolutely!

But, in the end the Creation Story is less about naming stars or picking sides and more about exploring the epic tale of existence itself – in a search that still has us talking, debating, and wondering all these years later.
