# How did we end up here?

Well, inspiring the Church to become the greatest storytellers in the world, is something the founders of Paper Giants are all about – and we do this by helping everyone tell **bigger** stories and **bolder** truths with **better** inspiration.

What started as a dream for the three founders with nearly 50 years of creative consulting, message development, marketing content creation has become a Kingdom-minded movement in churches across the country.

## How Can We Help You?

Paper Giants is already partnering with churches across the country thanks to the team’s experience with projects ranging from producing award-winning films, publishing books and articles for magazines, delivering countless talks and trainings, to the handling of marketing and print strategies for capital campaigns resulting in millions of dollars in donations.

Leveraging collaboration with the Church, Paper Giants offers a library of teaching outlines, commentaries, illustrations, story prompts, group guides, graphics and videos, as well as engaging social media and text messaging pieces to help shepherds and pastors of churches of all styles and sizes.

Still, this is just the beginning of the story…

… now, we want to hear and help you tell yours, as well as the greatest story ever told, the Gospel of Jesus Christ!
