## [Paid Ad Landing Pages](https://whitelabeldigital.co/paid-ad-landing-pages/)

By Robert Pettee

If you’re spending enough money on paid ads, you should consider landing pages that you can test and optimize for paid ad traffic, specifically. Normally these pages have no-follow tags and no mention or connection to the regular website, they’re purely for converting paid ad traffic. This also means that they can be tested to increase the revenue of your ad traffic, without disturbing the main website, your SEO, or your existing & returning customers’ experience. You can mirror the messaging in your ads, test different CTAs, and test the position of CTAs and forms or other conversion events. With dedicated paid ad landing pages, you can also be a bit pushier and stronger with CTAs, compared to how you’d speak to your organic website traffic. That’s an important distinction, that people who know who you are and came to your site behave entirely different than people who don’t know who you are and were doing something else when you found them with an advertisement. Landing pages don’t have to be expensive, either. Often cloning an existing page and making some simple tweaks can go a long way. If you’re building a website, it’s a fraction of the normal cost to simply consider landing pages during design & development. Consider removing some navigation from paid ad landers, maybe make the logo in your header not clickable. Keep in mind that all of this can be tracked and tested; you might think user would get irritated if they can’t click the logo or are missing links in the header, but if revenue per site visitor goes up, put the assumptions aside. If your budgets are large enough, it’s a near guarantee that different sources of traffic will perform best using different landing pages and assets. Different users, different mindsets, slightly different landing pages. You can also consider making geographic references on landing pages, where your buys are segmented well enough to speak to users’ geographic location. Again, test it to see if it actually moves the needle with respect to revenue per site visitor. – _We’re always looking for problems to solve, and we’re happy to show you how we do it.
