## Digital Ad Campaign Must-Have #3

* * *

Published August 14, 2025

**Cross-Channel Consistency**

In today’s fragmented media landscape, consumers move fluidly between search engines, social feeds, streaming platforms, websites, and apps. That’s why we design campaigns that are cohesive, connected, and consistent-wherever your audience shows up. Below are a few things that we consider, but we also find ourselves reminding clients that where we chose to spend their budget should be guided by their goals, which often don’t require – or even suffer from using an “everywhere, all the time” approach.

Be selective in where you spend your ad dollars, ensure accurate tracking and a firm understanding of the variance in what any metric can mean from one platform to the next; an SEM click is a qualified site visitor about 90% of the time, where a mobile in-app 320×50 ad click might show a 99% bounce rate. Exhaust existing demand first, then consider the next lowest hanging fruit. Spend enough in a channel to have an impact and generate enough data to tell you what it’s worth, and be mindful of the cost of assets required to enter into some channels. A limited selection of high-end assets can lend to expensive over-indexing in CTV, for example. Try not to focus on what feels good or makes you happy; we’re spending real money to drive an outcome. That should be the focus.

**Unified Audience Targeting**  
We still use some 3rd party audience data but the focus is more on first-party CRM data, lookalike audiences, intent and in-market signals, and custom retargeting segments to reach users consistently across search, social, display, CTV/OTT, streaming audio, and beyond. Your message follows your audience, not just the channel. Caution not to severely over-index if you do run more than 2-3 channels. Platform-specific impression caps normally do the trick, you’ll over-index here or there but if you’re average is where you want it within any one channel, that’s a good start.

**Platform-Specific Strategies**  
Each channel plays a different role in the buyer journey. We tailor creative placements and messaging strategies for each environment (e.g., direct response on search, storytelling on video, retargeting on social) while maintaining brand tone and visual alignment. Context matters, and different ad platforms, as well as different ad types within those platforms, drive varying types of responses. This is normally a topic focused around messaging and targeting, but also consider that different ad types will bring different types of conversion events, interactions, and response mechanisms. Be sure to evaluate those and understand what each is worth, relative to one another. Deciding where to spend more or less money requires a firm understanding of those value-oriented events, from one channel to the next.

**Creative Continuity Across Touchpoints**  
We work with your supplied assets (or help you develop new ones) to ensure that imagery, voice, calls-to-action, and messaging stay aligned. Whether it’s a YouTube pre-roll, a Facebook carousel, a Google Search ad, or a streaming audio spot, we can help ensure a consistent message across touch points. We also work with many clients to ideate new iterations of creative imagery and messaging, keeping messaging fresh but also A/B testing where we have the assets.

**Centralized Reporting & Insights**  
Our cross-channel dashboards give you a single source of truth across all of your digital assets, including paid ad data, GA4 website analytics data and custom data feeds (CRM, email platforms, etc). so you can see how your digital campaigns perform in isolation and together, with attribution models that connect the dots between awareness and action. We handle all of the Tag Manager work required for ad tracking, and often create custom GA4 Events for clients to track key events beyond their paid ad traffic.

The result should be a seamless, high-impact brand experience that builds trust, drives engagement, and conversion – no matter where your audience finds you.
