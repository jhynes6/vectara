## Can I Just Build You a Website?

If you’re at an agency, you’ve almost certainly seen clients with websites that you’d suggest they show nobody, ever. We’ve got a couple of digital tactics on-hand for these clients, where we drive people to call or convert without sending anyone to the client’s site. Do what you need to do, in order to monetize the traffic you generate with ad spend, that’s the idea. It’s also a bit of a shock to some clients that simply putting information in an image and showing that image on screens is “job done”. Ads get people’s attention and drive them to a website that needs to convey benefits and CTAs to push the user down a conversion funnel.

We’ll also build a website if we truly need one. For one client a few years ago, we spent upwards of $40,000 building a website and custom CMS for evolving coupons and promotions. They were a huge group of franchise owners in the retail space, across the country, without access to track the website managed by headquarters. Even with access, it wasn’t what we needed, so we just built a new site that’d let us offer-up downloadable coupons and spin-up pages & promotions on a dime, all tracked properly. Our pricing model let us simply bake-in that cost, or at least most of it, over the course of the year. No debates, no corralling 800 business owners, no underestimation or confusion [on the part of the client] as to the value of having this new website. Do what you need to do, in order to monetize the traffic you generate with ad spend, as always.

The concept of monetizing your website visitors, focusing on revenue per visitor, is another reason why we love testing landing pages. The numbers don’t lie, testing works and without an adequate website you just can’t get that done. Consider paid ad landing pages during development and you’ll be able to get the assets that you need for a tiny additional expense to the project.
