## [Targeting Your Client Their Own Ads](https://whitelabeldigital.co/reach-your-client-with-their-ads/)

By Robert Pettee

Time and time again, we benefit from taking a few minutes to consider how best to reach a client with their own paid ads. It sounds wasteful, but we’re talking about pennies a day. On a $12 CPM, which is higher than necessary to ensure quality placement and context, you can show an ad 4 times per day to each of 10 people, at a cost of $14.40 per month. If your client is engaged, or perhaps wondering if their ads are actually reaching people online, it’s worth $10 or $20 a month to show your client their ads “in the wild”. Consider a frequency cap, of course, and ad pulsing or only running on a couple days per week can help to minimize waste while ensuring adequate reach. When a client discussion starts with them proclaiming that they see their ads all over the place, you’re off to a good start. Digital ads can feel like smoke and mirrors to some clients; we know what they can do, and we take it upon ourselves to truly drive value, but don’t assume that your clients understand all of that, nor that they inherently trust in it. Beyond simply making a client feel comfortable that their ads are truly reaching an audience of people online, consider who “your client” is, exactly, and what tiny remarketing segments or user targets could assist your client. For example, we run a large volume of campaigns for leasing and apartment properties. You’d not think to target existing residents with ads, as they already live there, but what about reinforcing the benefits and advantages of living there, in a manner that might lower the rate at which residents move out? – _We’re always looking for problems to solve, and we’re happy to show you how we do it.
