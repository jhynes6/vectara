Campaign Criteria

Targeting

Describe your top three target personas (clients): 
 (ex: We sell to small business owners in the services industry with more than 10 employees) 
 (ex: We sell to marketing decision makers at ecommerce businesses with more than 5 employees) 
 (ex: We sell to founders of technology-enabled companies) 
 We sell to all medical specialities with Cardiovascular, Gastroenterology, Allergy, and Dermatology being the biggest.  They are usually private practices
 Ortho, 
 We sell to all dental specialties (ortho, primary etc)
 The practices must take Commercial insurance or Medicare Advantage (or potentially managed Medicaid).
 We do not negotiate for state Medicaid or straight federal Medicare.
 Are there industries you won’t sell to? 
 (ex. Health Care, Law Firms, Franchises)
 Behavioral Health, DME, ABA are specialties that we prefer to not.  We do not sell to hospitals, but we can work with smaller regional hospitals.

Offerings

What services do you sell to your top 3 target personas? (ex. PPC, Social Content, Email Marketing) 
 (ex: Email marketing to small business owners in the service industry)
 (ex: TikTok UGC to Marketing Decision makers at e-commerce businesses)
 (ex: PPC to founders of technology-enabled companies) 
 Re-negotiation of their payer contracts (any contact over 1 year old)
 Setting up their practice (initial contracts) 
 Credentialling Services 
 For each service, what are your top offers (packages/examples) that you would be willing to pitch them?
 (ex: Guaranteed 30% more email revenue in 90 days for SMB owners)
 (ex: First 5 UGC videos for free for DTC E-Commerce Brands)
 (ex: 30 Days Free Ad Management)
 We have a performance based model (we only get paid if we are able to secure them an increase)

Cost of Services

What is your average order value? What are your “Starting At” costs for your services?
 (ex: Email Marketing: campaign strategy, design, development, automation, personalization, and analytics. Pricing is everything from one-off projects at $10-$50k to yearly agreements up to $1MM/year)
 (ex: 1000 Tik Tok Impressions/month + Content Creation= $5000 order value)
 (ex: tier 1: $2500 CPC Budget + $500 Service Fee, tier 3: $12,500 CPC Budget + $2500 Service Fee)
 $5500 -$7500 for initiation fee on average  
 ⅓ of the increase we are able to secure them upon receiving an offer paid over 3 installments 

Service Differentiation

What makes you different from your competitors? What is your “special sauce”?
 (ex: We implement 8 proprietary flows to maximally engage customers via email. 14 touch-points across a 30 day visit to our customers site has been proven to concert the highest % of site visits to paying and repeat customers)
 Performance Based Guarantee, if we don’t get them an ROI or new contract then we don’t keep any fees.

Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? What do you do to improve their business?
 (ex: My clothing line has stopped reaching new buyers and we want to break into a new niche. Facebook keeps getting more expensive and makes it hard to target new buyers.
 Solution: Organic UGC content is the perfect mechanism to branch out to new customers. We help you find influencers who are exactly like your target audience, work with them to create videos and then use those videos to penetrate your new niche audience.)
 Providers must contract with payers to get paid for procedures. Most providers have never negotiated those rates and many struggle to even obtain contracts with payers .  We help practice negotiate their rates by being the middle person taking on the administrative work, analysis of rates and contracts, acquiring their contracts/fee schedules and a turn key solution during the negotiations themselves.  

Case Studies and Previous Customer Successes

For each service, what are case studies or recent customer successes that you use to highlight your expertise in your field?
 (ex: generated 50k in net new sales in 30 days for a service business with a seasonal email marketing campaign)
 (ex: generated 120k in net new revenue with a GenZ-focused organic TikTok Campaign) 
 (ex: increased CTR by 240% and sign ups by 318% with Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo Campaign)
 We’ve generated millions of dollars in revenue for our clients over the years through our negotiation efforts.  Our average increase is between 10-20% over their current rates which has tens of thousands of dollars in revenue impact for even small practices.

When comparing us to our distinguished competition, here are a few things that set us apart:


We have been in business over 10+ years with a team that brings decades of experience to payer negotiations. We have contract negotiators on our team who used to negotiate on behalf of the payers, but now have come to the ‘light side’


We have sophisticated teams of project managers, medical economics, account managers, contract negotiators working around the clock on your negotiations with a proven track record.


We have secured tens of millions of dollars on behalf of our clients over the years.


We do not charge monthly fees or large consulting fees. Our fees are performance based and guaranteed when we work with at least 5 qualified payers. We only collect fees if we get you contracts and rates that provide you a return on investment.


We only take on a select number of clients per year, not hundreds like some of our competitors who focus on monthly fees rather than guaranteed success.


Our incentives are aligned. If you succeed, we succeed.


We are looking forward to applying our extensive knowledge and experience to your payer negotiation and helping to increase your revenue but more importantly your bottom line and profit.


Please reach out at any time with any questions.
