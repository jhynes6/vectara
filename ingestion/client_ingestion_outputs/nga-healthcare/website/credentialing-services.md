## Credentialing Case Studies

### Otolaryngology (ENT) Group

An Otolaryngology (ENT) group with 10 providers requiring streamlined credentialing with multiple health plans.

**The Challenge:**  Historically, the group faced significant delays in the credentialing process, taking 8 to 12 months to fully credential a provider with all health plans. These prolonged timelines led to delays in revenue generation and operational inefficiencies.

**The Solution:**  NGA Healthcare partnered with the ENT group to expedite their credentialing process. Key actions included:

*   Implementing a structured and efficient approach to manage the credentialing workflow.
*   Coordinating with health plans to address bottlenecks and reduce delays.
*   Providing ongoing support to ensure accurate and timely submission of required documentation.

**The Results:**  NGA Healthcare successfully reduced the credentialing timeline to just 6 months—a significant improvement over the group’s historical average of 8-12 months.

**Financial Impact:**  The practice realized an estimated $230,000 in additional revenue, generated 6 months earlier than their previous credentialing processes allowed.

**Conclusion:**  By optimizing the credentialing process, NGA Healthcare not only accelerated provider enrollment but also unlocked substantial financial benefits for the practice. This case demonstrates how efficient credentialing can drive revenue growth and operational success for healthcare organizations.

### Multi-Specialty Surgery Practice

A multi-specialty surgery practice with 40 providers requiring ongoing credentialing services.

**The Challenge:**  The practice faced inefficiencies in its credentialing process, leading to significant revenue leakage. NGA Healthcare identified that approximately 5% of providers were not enrolled in certain health plans. These enrollment gaps resulted in out-of-network denials amounting to approximately $40,000 per month in accounts receivable—a major financial and operational burden for the practice.

**The Solution:**  NGA Healthcare implemented a proactive credentialing strategy to address these challenges. Key actions included:

*   Conducting regular audits of the provider list to ensure all 40 providers were enrolled and in-network with all applicable health plans.
*   Collaborating closely with the practice to streamline enrollment processes and close any gaps in network participation.

**The Results:**  NGA Healthcare’s diligent efforts yielded transformative outcomes:

*   Reduced the number of providers out of network to zero, eliminating enrollment-related issues.
*   Decreased out-of-network denials, effectively recovering the $40,000 per month previously lost in accounts receivable.
