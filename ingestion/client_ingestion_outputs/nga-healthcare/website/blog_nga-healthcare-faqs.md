# NGA Healthcare FAQs

Frequently asked questions 

## How long has NGA been in business?
NGA Healthcare has been in operation since 2014, and we have decades of Payer Negotiation Experience.

## How do you charge for your services?
NGA Healthcare works with our clients to accommodate their cash flow needs and we can charge flat fees or % of increases based on performance.

## Do you negotiate new contracts?
NGA Healthcare can obtain and negotiate new contracts and renegotiate existing contracts for nearly every speciality all over the U.S.

## How long does it take to negotiate contacts?
On average renegotiations take 7 months, and new contract negotiations average between 4-8 months, but it's highly dependent on the individual payers.

## What specialities have you successfully negotiated?
As long as the specialty isn't strictly hospital based we have likely negotiated payer contracts for it in the past.

## What states do you negotiate in?
We can negotiate in every state, and we've negotiated in over 46 states and counting.

## Can you negotiate and obtain National Contracts?
Yes, we negotiate and obtain National contracts, as long as the practice meets the contracting requirements for each payer.

## Does NGA have references we can speak with?
Yes, we can provide physician/practice references upon request.

## How much does it cost?
We charge an initiation fee (which is guaranteed) that is determined by your practice size/specialty/location, and then performance fees based on the contracts or increases we obtain, but only once we obtain the increase or new contract.

## What kind of guarantee do you offer?
If we are negotiating at least 5 contracts, we guarantee we will obtain an increase and/or new contract, or there is no cost to you.
