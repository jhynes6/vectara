# Pricing

At our core, we’re driven by results: if you don’t get paid more, neither do we. With a bonus structure aligned to boost your bottom line, we’re incentivized to secure the best possible outcome for your practice.

## Contract Negotiation Pricing

Most Practices aren't getting that rates that they deserve. NGA Healthcare has a success rate of 100% in negotiating contracts; we have been able to negotiate at least one major contract for each of our clients. The result is an increase in reimbursement that quickly covers the cost of our services.

### Initial Fee

Our initiation fee covers all work and time for our services. Even if negotiation takes months, dozens of calls, and hundreds of emails, we never charge for additional hours. The fee is dependent on the specialty, size of the practice, and the number of plans to be negotiated.

### Performance Bonuses

We build in a bonus structure based on the percentage increases we are able to obtain per health plan. We are incentivized to get a higher increase that will greatly increase the bottom line for your practice.

## Credentialing Pricing

NGA Healthcare provides unmatched and expert credentialing and credentialing maintenance services including initial credentialing, re-credentialing, Medicare, Medicaid, and assistance with provider disputes related to credentialing.
