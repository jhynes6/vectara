Preferred Methods of Communication

Who will be taking calls from leads?
 | Chris Hill

If necessary, are you comfortable taking calls from leads via phone?
 | Yes

Mode of contact with MintLeads? (Email/Slack/Phone)
 | All are good with us. We use Slack internally, so that would be best for day-to-day communications. 

In the case where either contacts are on vacation, how should we reach out with updates or questions about the campaigns?

Email will be fine if both of us are on vacation. We may also designate a third person if both of us are away. 


Campaign Criteria

Targeting

Describe your top three target personas (clients): 
 We sell to tech startups with 5-100 employees that are interested in Developer Relations (aka DevRel) content and/or content to promote their business. 
 We sell to independent entrepreneurs and business consultants who are interested in growing their personal brands. 
 We sell to businesses that want podcasting to be part of their marketing & communications strategy. 
 Are there industries you won’t sell to? 
 We would like to avoid political & religious podcasts. 

Offerings

What services do you sell to your top 3 target personas? (ex. PPC, Social Content, Email Marketing) 
 Tech Startups - Bi-Weekly Full-Service Video Podcast Production
 Independent Entrepreneurs / Consultants - Weekly & Bi-Weekly Full-Service Video Podcast Production
 Businesses - Weekly & Bi-Weekly Standard Video Podcast Promotion
 Note: It’s all basically the same, I’ve included the most common services we provide to each client. We can provide a pricing sheet with more info on what all these packages mean. 
 For each service, what are your top offers (packages/examples) that you would be willing to pitch them?
 15% on a 1-year Term is our top offer on all packages at the moment. Definitely open to more here. 

Cost of Services

What is your average order value? What are your “Starting At” costs for your services?
 First Month: Anywhere from $2,500 to $8,500.
 Monthly Recurring Services Start at $400 per episode for an audio-only podcast, $750 per episode for a video podcast, and then with our content writing package that goes up to $750 and $1,100 respectively. 
 Our average order value on its own is $1,500/mo. 

Service Differentiation

What makes you different from your competitors? What is your “special sauce”?
 Our goal is to make your podcast production easy, and our services reflect that. We are a done-for-you service outside of the fact that the client needs to record the podcast itself. We help with every aspect of production. 
 Unlike a lot of other podcast production companies, we are using professional editors with years of experience in media production. We also use professional editing software, which is becoming a bigger and bigger contrast between us and clients that just rely on Descript or similar simple AI services for their editing needs. 
 And again, at the end of the day, our clients love how easy we make podcast production. You can view some of the testimonials we have on our services page for more examples: https://www.humblepod.com/our-services/ 

Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? What do you do to improve their business?
 Customers who come to us don’t know the first thing about creating a podcast outside of the fact that they want one. 
 Our team makes the entire process simple to understand and makes it as easy as possible to create a podcast that they can be proud of. 

Case Studies and Previous Customer Successes

For each service, what are case studies or recent customer successes that you use to highlight your expertise in your field?
 We have put multiple clients in the top 100 podcast charts. 
 We have managed multi-million dollar podcast ad campaigns
 Our clients have generated hundreds of thousands of dollars based on leads generated with their podcasts.
