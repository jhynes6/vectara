# Introduction

If you’re in the market for new podcast gear or just looking to find out the quickest and easiest way to start a podcast is, this guide is for you. The Podcast Gear Guide we’ve developed here at HumblePod has one primary goal: **Get you the information you need quickly and efficiently so that you can get back to the art of podcasting.**

The gear provided in this guide consists of microphones, recorders, and headphones that we’ve owned and used extensively. We can vouch for their usefulness and effectiveness, and we hope that, as a result, this guide saves you a lot of time in your gear purchasing process.

## How to use the guide

This guide is broken down into a couple of easy-to-answer questions. Answer these questions, and you’ll be directed to a page containing information on the podcast gear that meets your needs. If you review the gear and decide you want to look at something else, there will be a navigation pane so that you can navigate to other pages and view all options.

If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions on this guide, feel free to reach out to us directly here.
