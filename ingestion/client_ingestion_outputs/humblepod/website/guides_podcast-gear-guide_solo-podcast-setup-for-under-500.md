# Solo Podcast Setup for Under $500

## Microphone: Shure MV7

The Shure MV7 is another great beginning microphone that is perfect for recording into a computer either for solo recordings or online interviews. It’s essentially the baby brother of the Shure SM7B. It comes with a great app that will automatically adjust your mic’s volume and dynamics according to your personal preferences. It’s easy to use and produces a great sound if you’re just starting out. It’s also worth noting that the mic comes with an XLR output as well, so as you grow your collection, you can use this mic in a future setup. This is a great investment if you’re still under quarantine and have a co-host you plan to reconnect with once you can record in person again. Since you’ll be using this at your desk, I recommend finding a good mic arm. You can go super cheap to start or invest in a quality arm like the Rode PSA-1 that will last you a long time.

## Headphones: Audio Technica M20X

These are great basic headphones. They’ve got everything you need to monitor audio and even edit your shows. They’re pretty durable as well. The only downside here is that these cans aren’t as compact as some of Audio Technica’s higher-end headphones. They’ll do great, and if you continue to upgrade your gear, they make great guest headphones. If you’re looking for alternative headphones, just recall what I’ve mentioned in the buyer’s guide. You can find cheaper headphones, and the gear you’re using at this level only requires 1/8″ headphone jacks. The big thing to avoid here is headphones with an inline mic. Inline Mics use TRRS (Tip Ring Ring Sleeve) cables, which phones and laptops read as a stereo cable with a microphone, versus the TRS (Tip Ring Sleeve) cable which is just a stereo cable. That extra ring (and yes, you’ll notice the third ring on TRRS cables) will cause impedance on the line and, in most cases, will mean that you’ll find yourself cranking up the volume to compensate for this. So, sure, you can use them, but in my experience, that impedance can be significant, so be warned.
