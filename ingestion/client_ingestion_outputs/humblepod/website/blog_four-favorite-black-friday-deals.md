# Four Favorite Black Friday Deals

Black Friday is right around the corner, and that means it’s a great time to find deals on podcast gear. Whether you’re searching for new gear for your show, someone looking to help another podcaster who is getting started, or you just need a better setup for Zoom calls and being a guest on podcasts, this post is for you.

Also, just a quick heads up that the links provided are Amazon Affiliate links. That said, the gear you’ll find here is recommended solely on its merits, and purchasing through these links allows us to continue to write posts like this and help keep you up-to-date on great deals.

### Best In-Ear Monitors (a.ka. Ear Buds) for Video Podcasting

#### [Shure SE215 PRO](https://amzn.to/4i52JUX)

If you’re a guest (or host), you want to look your best on camera, and that’s why I recommend these in-ear monitors (IEM) for video podcasting. Thankfully, Shure has the SE215 PROs on sale this year, and you can get them for a great price. I recommend the clear ones as they’re most likely to be rendered invisible when recording.

### Best Professional Microphone Deal

#### [Shure SM7B](https://amzn.to/3OskJLD)

This is a fantastic mic for podcasting, and it’s on sale. Frankly, this is the lowest I’ve seen it in a while, so it’s definitely worth buying if you’re in the market for a new mic. This mic has a deep, rich sound, and if you’re wanting that right out of the box, you’re going to be really pleased.

**Note:** This mic will require a [Cloudlifter CL-1](https://www.amazon.com/Cloudlifter-CL-1), so you might be better off paying more and getting the [SM7dB](https://amzn.to/3CFiguK) which has a built-in pre-amp. This will save you from having to buy that peripheral and extra XLR cable.

### Favorite Podcast Doohickey

#### [Gator Frameworks Quick Release Stand Attachment](https://amzn.to/3CG23VU)

In the odds and ends department, there’s no better addition to your mic setup than the [Gator Frameworks Quick Release Stand Attachment](https://www.amazon.com/Gator-Frameworks-Quick-Release). This little dude has saved me a ton of time when traveling, and it comes highly recommended. My one word of warning is that it does add some height to your setup, so please consider that in getting this. That said, whether you’re a beginning podcaster or a seasoned professional, this thing is just awesome for quick setups.

### Favorite Travel Purchase

#### [tomtoc Travel Backpack 40L](https://amzn.to/3ZkSox1)

Let’s face it: flying solo with gear can suck. You want to pack light, but you also need to be sure you’re bringing the right equipment. This can lead to many challenges, but nothing as bad as figuring out how to pack your clothes along with gear without needing an extra carry-on. This year I decided to get the [tomtoc Travel Backpack](https://www.amazon.com/tomtoc-Travel-Backpack-40L) for my trip to Seattle, and I’m very pleased with its versatility. It has a lot of space for my laptop, iPad, and chargers as well as clothes and some extra space for miscellaneous gear.
