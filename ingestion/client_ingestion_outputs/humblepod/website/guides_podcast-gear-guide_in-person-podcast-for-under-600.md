# In-Person Podcast Setup for Under $600

## Microphone: Shure SM58

This is the most ubiquitous mic in the world. It’s the mic at every karaoke bar. The one at every open mic night… It’s probably even the same mic you’ll see at large arena concerts. It’s everywhere, and it’s everywhere for a reason. It’s a durable microphone. They literally have videos of this mic getting run over by a truck and still being used. At its price point, it’s the same cost as the [Rode Podmic](https://www.rode.com/microphones/podmic), and it delivers a warmer sound while requiring less gain input to drive the mic. Some folks like that crisp, clear sound the Podmic delivers, but personally, I think that’s a minor point when you’re recording.

So why do I like this mic? It’s tough (as noted). It’s also sensitive to gain input, and it has GREAT noise rejection (aka, it doesn’t pick up background noise). It’s just a cardioid patterned mic, but after a few sessions of recording in a noisy space, you can quickly see why this mic is used at so many different music venues. It does a great job of picking up only the performer’s voice with minimal background noise. Also, if you record on the go, these mics can be handheld with way less rustling noise than their competitors (the ATR 2100 and the Samson Q2U).

## Microphone: Shure MV7

The Shure MV7 is another great beginning microphone that is perfect for recording into a computer either for solo recordings or online interviews. It’s essentially the baby brother of the Shure SM7B. It comes with a great app that will automatically adjust your mic’s volume and dynamics according to your personal preferences. It’s easy to use and produces a great sound if you’re just starting out. It’s also worth noting that the mic comes with an XLR output as well, so as you grow your collection, you can use this mic in a future setup. This is a great investment if you plan to do some in-person recordings, but also want to record remotely. Since you’ll be using this at your desk, I recommend finding a good mic arm. You can go super cheap to start or invest in a quality arm like the Rode PSA-1 that will last you a long time.

## Additional Gear

I recommend you pick up the SM58 package with the 10′ XLR cable. Beyond that, you’ll need a mic stand and a foam cover pop filter. This mic will definitely need the pop filter, too. If you want to go crazy, you might consider a shock mount, but I wouldn’t waste your time trying to carry that around if you plan on doing in-person recordings. It’s much easier to just ask people to keep their hands and phones off the table.

## Headphones: Audio Technica M20X

These are great basic headphones. They’ve got everything you need to monitor audio and even edit your shows. They’re pretty durable as well. The only downside here is that these cans aren’t as compact as some of Audio Technica’s higher-end headphones. They’ll do great, and if you continue to upgrade your gear, they make great guest headphones. If you’re looking for alternative headphones, just recall what I’ve mentioned in the buyer’s guide. You can find cheaper headphones, and the gear you’re using at this level only requires 1/8″ headphone jacks. The big thing to avoid here is headphones with an inline mic. Inline Mics use TRRS (Tip Ring Ring Sleeve) cables, which phones and laptops read as a stereo cable with a microphone, versus the TRS (Tip Ring Sleeve) cable which is just a stereo cable. That extra ring (and yes, you’ll notice the third ring on TRRS cables) will cause impedance on the line and, in most cases, will mean that you’ll find yourself cranking up the volume to compensate for this. So, sure, you can use them, but in my experience, that impedance can be significant, so be warned.

## Recorder: Zoom P4

First off, this is Zoom the recording company. It has no affiliation with Zoom the conference calling company’s sub-par audio that everyone seems to think is okay to use for podcast recording sessions. You may be wondering, so I figured I’d set the record straight there. I don’t think I’ve ever been more excited to see a recorder come to market. For only $200, you can have up to four XLR Inputs, a Bluetooth connection (additional hardware required), TRRS inputs, FOUR headphone outputs, AND it doubles as a USB audio interface. If you’re just getting started in podcasting, I couldn’t recommend a better device. Did I mention it has a mini soundboard, too?
