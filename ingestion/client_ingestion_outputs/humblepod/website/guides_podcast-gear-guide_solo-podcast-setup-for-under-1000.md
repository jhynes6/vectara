# Solo Podcast Setup for Under $1,000

## Microphone: ElectroVoice RE320

If you’re looking for a higher-end microphone, but you’re not ready to drop the big bucks just yet, this is the mic I recommend. It’s got a solid, sound, and in some ways, it’s easier to use than most other dynamic mics. Like most every mic in the RE range, it has these special coils on the side of the mic that actively combat what we know as the proximity effect. They call this technology “Variable D,” and you can get a solid [explanation of it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MDxZ2LDANA).

The proximity effect is pretty much exactly what it sounds like. The closer to the mic you are, the louder you are. As noted briefly with the mics above, both of them have “sweet spots” for where you’ll sound the best and prevent the most noise rejection. For vocals in music or voice acting, this is sometimes vital to creating a character or song, but for spoken word podcasts and interview-style shows, this isn’t necessary.

The alternative here is the Shure SM7B or the Rode Procaster. Both of which are great choices. They just don’t have quite the crisp, clear sound that the RE320 does, in my opinion. The Shure is also notoriously gain hungry, which means you’ll be spending another $100+ on a gain booster to even get the thing to work.

## Headphones: Audio Technica M50X

If you’re looking to up your game and get some higher-end headphones, look no further than these babies. They are great and can become really compact for travel. They’ve got great frequency response (up to 28 kHz), and a solid bass, which is great for personal enjoyment. These are my on-site headphones to this day, and I really like them. Aside from the warm fuzzies, again, there are PLENTY of headphones at this price point you could purchase. There’s even one pair that I consider the “pro” set below that is just as good. In all honesty, for podcast production, this is the line where you go from studio-quality gear into the realm of Audiophile. As noted in the buying guide, as long as you avoid heavily colored (think “ENHANCED BASS” marketing callouts on the box) and Bluetooth headphones, you’ll be in a good place here.

### Audio Interface: Focusrite Vocaster One

I’m a big fan of Focusrite interfaces. I used the 2nd gen 2i2 for a long time, and, when I got the chance to test the Vocaster out, I was thrilled by what I discovered. Compared to the 2i2, this is a more powerful unit, and it’s purpose-built for podcasters. Its gain reaches 70dB, and, according to the manufacturer that will enable you to use quieter mics without the need for a Cloudlifter or similar gain booster. If you’re just getting into solo podcasting, I highly recommend getting either this unit or its big brother the Vocaster Two.
