# The Easy Guide to Starting a Podcast

So you wanna start a podcast? Well, this is the guide for you. At **HumblePod**, we’ve helped hundreds of people get started in their podcast journey, and in this guide we’re going to point you in the right direction for all your questions.

This is a free resource for anyone who is interested in starting a podcast. If you enjoy the content and would like to make your podcasting journey even easier, please be sure to sign up for our weekly newsletter and consider reaching out to us directly to find out how we can help you with podcast production.

## Start Your Podcast With A Plan

You might think the first thing you need to start a podcast is a fancy microphone and an 8k camera, but you’d be sorely mistaken. The truth is that some of the best podcasts you know and love today started out super small and on basic equipment. So what made them successful? They all started with a plan and a goal in mind.

## Position Your Podcast for Success

Once you have your concept developed, you need to think about how you’re going to position your show. There are so many great shows already out there, and there’s a high probability that someone is doing a show similar to yours. If not, congrats! You should absolutely be creating that show right now.

For more on this concept, check out Positioning Your Podcast from _The Humble Podcaster_.

## Develop a Framework for Your Podcast Episodes

You’ve got a concept and an angle you can use to position your podcast for success. Now it’s really important that you create a framework for your show that you can use over and over again with each new episode. This will help you avoid creative roadblocks early on and ensure that you visualize what to do with the show from beginning to end.

There’s a lot of details to go over here, so I’ve broken them out into two episodes:

## Record a Podcast

Now that we’ve got all the nebulous stuff out of the way, we can focus on the nuts & bolts of recording our first show. This is the fun part. If you’ve been wanting to buy gear, now is the time to do it! You can follow our podcast gear guide to find the gear that fits best with your budget and your mission.

This episode has a lot of great tips on gear as well as how to use it. So what are you waiting for? Check it out below.

## Edit Your Podcast

Recording your episode is only half the battle. Editing your content is the real challenge, and, quite often, what separates your show from everyone else. The value of a good edit cannot be overstated, and if you record your audio properly, you’ll be set for a great editing experience.

Learn more about the basics of editing a podcast in our “How To Edit A Podcast” episode.

## Launch Your Podcast!

You’ve done all the hard work of starting a podcast, and now it’s time to let the world know about your new show. In this episode, we step through the final steps for getting your podcast launched. We cover everything from how to start an RSS Feed to getting your show on Apple Podcasts and those first few episode releases.

The sooner you get to listening, the sooner you get to launching your podcast. Take a listen here!

## Bonus: Podcast Gear Guide

This guide is unique in that it is the culmination of years of podcast production experience, and I’m only recommending gear that I’ve used. It’s also set up to help you think through your gear at any budget level, so go check it out!

## Want to Start a Podcast the Easy Way?

You might have the best guides, gear, and strategy, but starting a podcast won’t happen if you don’t have time to execute it. That’s where we can help. Our team can help with everything from your initial podcast concept through week-in-week-out production and editing.
