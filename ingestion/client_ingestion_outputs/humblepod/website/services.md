# Services

## We Make Podcast Production Easy

When you partner with HumblePod, you’re partnering with _the company that makes podcast production easy_. Whether you’re just starting out and need full production support, or you have an established podcast and just need a quick, go-to solution, HumblePod has got you covered.

## Podcast Launch

For small businesses and entrepreneurs who are starting a brand-new podcast, we recommend our Podcast Launch Service. The Podcast Launch is a one-time, 6-week service that walks you through everything you need to launch your podcast.

We’ll walk you through brainstorming, market research, best practices, gear recommendations, show concept & development, and more. By the end of this launch, you will have a show concept, episode outline, custom intro and outro, professional show trailer, and your show will be launched to all major podcast streaming platforms.

## Standard Production

You’re ready for a professional podcast, and you’ve got a great team at your company to help with marketing, but none of you have the time or experience to professionally record, edit, and produce a podcast on a regular basis.

With our **Standard Production Service**, all of your audio production needs are covered. Our production team helps you manage your show, guiding you on best practices, editing your show, and managing the upload process for you to ensure episodes are released on time, every time.

## Full-Service Production

You’re ready for a professional podcast, but you have no support. As an entrepreneur, you see the value in creating a podcast to help you connect with other professionals in your area of expertise, develop new sales opportunities, and possibly even monetize your show down the road. But you need a plug-and-play solution.

With the **Full-Service Production Package**, all you have to do is record episodes and send us the files – we’ll do the rest! From professional **editing** to content **writing**, from **transcription** to **social media** promotion, our team does it all.

Our Project Managers will ensure your production stays on track, and will also be available to you as a professional podcast consultant, guiding you on best practices and answering any questions you have.

## Video Podcast Production

You want to go all-out and create a video podcast, or you need help supporting your existing show. We get it. Editing both an audio and video podcast is tough, and we’re here to make it easy!

This is an add-on service for **Standard** or **Full-Service** podcast production. Our team will edit your video podcast in either 1080p or 4k. We can work with single-camera content as well as multi-camera content. All content is uploaded to YouTube as part of this service.

## Additional Services

In addition to our podcast production services, we also offer custom production services that can be tailored to your business needs. These services include narrative podcast production, video editing, livestream/presentation production, animation, and custom social media video content (TikTok, YouTube, etc.).
