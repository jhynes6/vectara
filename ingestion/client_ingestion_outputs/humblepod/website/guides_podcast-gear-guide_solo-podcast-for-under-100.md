# Solo Podcast Setup for Under $100

## Microphone: Samson Q2U

This is about the lowest-budget microphone you can buy and still have some money left over for headphones. I’ve used this microphone on occasion as a backup and as a loaner, and I can tell you that it certainly does the job. However, it’s not a _great_ microphone. It’s prone to having connection issues and tends to be inconsistent on reliability. That said, if you’re getting started and want the MVP (minimum viable product), this is it.

## Alternative Microphone: Audio Technica ATR2100

The alternative here is the ATR2100. Personally, this is my recommended microphone in this range. More than likely, you’ll not go out and buy headphones as you’ll have a pair you’re currently using that will work already anyway. If that’s you, then I definitely recommend this microphone. It’s got the best sound quality for any microphone at this price point, and it’s an all-around reliable mic, too! These also make great guest/loaner microphones if you’re looking to have some gear you ship out to guests when you record.

## Headphones: Sony ZX110

When you’re recording a podcast, you need to isolate your computer’s audio output from your microphone as much as possible. The easiest way to do this is with headphones. If you don’t have a pair of wired headphones laying around, this pair will do the job – and pretty well for the price point. They’re also light and compact, so they’re easy to pack for recording on the road. Please note: when you purchase these, do not buy the pair with the microphone. That microphone adds a whole additional level of complexity to properly plugging it into your laptop or microphone.
