## Want To Take Things Further?

If you’re a business owner in a related industry and you’re interested in a collaboration that goes beyond an occaisional gift card, we’d love to have that conversation with you. Our goal is to build lasting, profitable partnerships with other companies in the marketing, advertising, & media production industry. If that sounds like you, please [contact us here](https://www.humblepod.com/contact/) to start the conversation.

## **How To Refer Someone To HumblePod**

The purpose of this referral program is to generate “Warm Leads,” from folks like you who are big fans of the work we do. We want this process to be as frictionless as possible so you can get rewarded and start sipping your next mochaccino or plain black coffee quickly. There are two steps in this process.

## Step 1: Introduce Your Contact to HumblePod

The first thing you need to do is introduce your contact to HumblePod. If you are familiar with our team, you are welcome to email the person of your choosing or simply email [referral@humblepod.com](mailto:referral@humblepod) to contact the entire sales team. If you would rather introduce them via text or phone, you are welcome to contact them that way as well. All that matters here is that you are the one who introduces them to our team.

Additionally, we know that sending an introduction email may sound straightforward, but often it can be difficult to know what to say. For that reason, here’s a simple fill-in-the-bracket script you can use to connect your referral with HumblePod.

**To:** [referral@humblepod.com,](mailto:referral@humblepod.com,) $referralname@domain.com

**From:** [yourname@domain.com](mailto:yourname@domain.com)

**Subject:** \[Name\] + \[Name\] Introduction

**Body:**

\[Referral Contact\],

I’d like to introduce you to \[HumblePod\]. This is the podcast production company I told you about recently, and I think they will make your podcast production challenges a lot easier. You can [check out their website here](https://www.humblepod.com/our-services/) to learn more about them and the podcast services they offer.

\[HumblePod\],

I’d like to introduce you to \[Referral Contact\]. \[Brief description of how you know them\]. They are interested in \[starting a podcast\] OR \[getting help with their podcast\]. \[Insert any additional supporting information here.\]

I think you two would really benefit from having a virtual call at some point in the near future. Please feel free to use this e-mail thread to make plans or at least exchange information.

Thanks,

## Step 2: Submit Your Referral Here

Once you've finished Step 1, please fill out the form below so that we can track your referral and send you the gift card of your choosing. Please note that we will not use the information provided in this form to reach out to referrals. This is only for verification and tracking purposes. You are responsible for for connecting the referral to the team at HumblePod via email or other means as noted in Step 1.
