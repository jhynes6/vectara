**Abundantly**

**OVERVIEW**

Abundantly is a global, mobile-first R&R platform that achieves tangible improvements in employee engagement, retention, and satisfaction by overcoming the challenges that so often undermine rewards and recognition strategies. Chiefly, they marry a suite of Amazon-backed rewards, experiential offerings, and charitable social giving opportunities with a proprietary AI component that overcomes managerial inertia and streamlines the process. The tool helps managers craft meaningful recognition messages that account for employee preferences, generational differences, and managers’ own busy schedules, automating as much as possible without sacrificing sincerity. Recognitions and point-based rewards are sent to employees via the app’s convenient social media feed, which also gives your staff the ability to recognize their peers directly.

Crucially, Abundantly has the reward catalogue depth and UX you’d expect from a modern R&R solution but provides it at a fraction of the cost. Flat, transparent pricing, absence of item markups, strategic offshore partnerships, and an overall lean operating model all give you the breathing room you need to invest your dollars in changing employee behavior and not the app itself. Speaking of modifying behavior, Abundantly uses the knowledge they’ve accumulated as a global R&R leader to provide extensive consultation and support on what your specific employees want, what’s stifling engagement, and how you can fine-tune your R&R budget to keep your costs low. Clients’ results have regularly come in at more than 80% utilization, a 22% bump in employee satisfaction, and an 11% reduction in avoidable turnover.

We should emphasize more of the personalized service and consultation we use to collabrate with customers to create traction with their R&R program

There are constant improvements to the platform. We will be adding a wellness function in addition to R&R. We have a roadmap to include employee perks, wellness and integrations with other HR functions.
