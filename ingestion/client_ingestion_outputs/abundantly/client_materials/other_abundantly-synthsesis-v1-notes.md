**SYNTHESIS**

**OVERVIEW & CORE VALUE PROPOSITION**

Abundantly elevates employee engagement, retention, satisfaction, and their many related behaviors by marrying nuanced incentive consulting with an AI-assisted rewards and recognition platform. Rather than try to differentiate themselves on the basis of catalogue size, they’ve turned their attention towards the actual root causes of R&R program underperformance: behavioral inertia, absence of sophisticated incentive strategies, and runaway costs. The result is a white-labeled recognition experience that’s cost-efficient, culturally aligned, and achieving tangible results of more than 80% utilization, a 22% bump in employee satisfaction, and an 11% reduction in avoidable turnover.

On the frontend, employees see and engage with a wide spectrum of reward types, including gift cards, Amazon-backed goods, experiential offerings, branded company swag, and charitable donation opportunities. Those rewards are seamlessly blended with realtime peer-to-peer and manager-led recognitions, nominations, service awards, point-based awards, and polls, all coordinated through a convenient social media style feed within the app. On the backend, Abundantly’s AI tools intelligently nudge managers to engage with employees when it matters most; help users craft high-quality, deeply meaningful recognition messages; and identify engagement levels, trends, and feedback to fine-tune the client’s overarching R&R strategy. Abundantly makes it easy and time-efficient for managers and employees alike to engage with their peers no matter their location, generational differences, or communication style preferences.

Perhaps most importantly, Abundantly partners directly with HR leaders to craft a targeted, easily maintained, and budget-conscious engagement strategy. As an internationally recognized leader in rewards and recognition, they understand intimately what employees want, how to incentivize the right behaviors, and how to minimize costs along the way. Their culture strategists and support teams help clients customize and brand the platform, even identifying which cultural elements may be harming program success and how to overcome them. From rollout to reporting, Abundantly ensures that its technology is not just implemented, but adopted, optimized, and effective across the organization.

Abundantly is further differentiated by their transparent, cost-efficient business model. Unlike many R&R solution providers, Abundantly does not profit from reward markups or hidden fees. Rewards are purchased at face value, ensuring the full value of each reward reaches the intended employee. Platform usage costs less than $5 per employee per month and can be brought even lower with discounts from subscription and multi-year contract arrangements. Ultimately, a blend of lean operations, strategic offshore or international? partnerships, and AI-enhanced functionality allow Abundantly to affordably deliver optimal R&R performance without ever sacrificing quality, reward diversity, or the user experience.

Abundantly provides clients with extensive backend reporting and platform management tools, making it easy to monitor and adapt engagement strategies in realtime. Clients can easily highlight specific cultural values for managers to prioritize when recognizing employees; create custom rewards for employees to redeem; add nomination categories and assign designated approvers; and even communicate with their entire organizations through in-app announcements. Beyond Abundantly’s mobile and desktop apps, clients can seamlessly integrate the platform into their existing workflow tools – such as ADP, Workday, SAP, LinkedIn, Slack, Teams (move after Slack) Salesforce, Teams, and many more – making it easy for users to recognize and reward their colleagues on-the-spot. Combined, these elements ensure recognition becomes a natural, embedded part of daily work rather than a siloed, infrequent task.
