Case Study

In today’s fast-paced world of senior living and memory care,
employee engagement is paramount for providing exceptional
care and maintaining high-quality services. However, many
providers struggle to find effective ways to engage their staff
members while also recognizing their contributions and providing
meaningful rewards. Let’s explore how Commonwealth Senior Living
(CSL) addressed their challenges by implementing a
comprehensive engagement and recognition platform and service.

Commonwealth Senior Living (CSL) is on a mission to enhance the
lives of their residents, their families and each other. Located on the
East Coast, CSL offers independent living, assisted living, and
memory care services across over 40 communities in six states.
They emphasize personalized care and support, guided by its core
values of compassion, accountability, passion, communication,
ownership, and respect. In addition to being listed as a “Great Place
to Work” CSL is always on a mission to enhance the lives of their
residents and associates. The CSL HR team of Tommy Comer
(CHRO), Amber Turner (VP of HR), and Marybeth Showalter (VP of
Training Systems) undertook their next project to better engage
CSL’s employees. This is their study that demonstrates the
transformative impact of prioritizing employee recognition in
delivering high-quality care services

the Challenge

For the team at CSL, traditional
recognition methods often fail to capture
real time achievements and foster an
ongoing culture of appreciation. Despite
acknowledging the significance of
employee engagement,
Commonwealth Senior Living faced
several challenges:

Tommy

Amber

Marybeth

Lack of a centralized platform for communication and recognition:
Communication among staff members was fragmented, making it
difficult to foster a sense of community and acknowledge employee
contributions effectively.

Limited resources for employee recognition and rewards: The CSL
lacked a structured system for recognizing and rewarding employees,
leading to an unknown level of motivation and morale among staff.

Difficulty in measuring engagement: Without proper tools and
metrics, the client struggled to assess the level of engagement
among their communities and identify areas for improvement.

the Solution

CSL initiated the creation of Pineapple People Praise to address the need
for a dynamic, inclusive, and engaging recognition platform that aligns
with their core values and enhances overall community well being. To
address their need, CSL sought a comprehensive engagement, rewards
and recognition platform and service that could provide:

Centralized Communication: A platform that would enable
seamless communication among staff members, allowing them to
share updates, celebrate achievements, and connect with each
other regardless of their location. As Marybeth said of their
situation,” there are too many places to go.”

Recognition and Rewards: A system for recognizing employee
contributions in real-time and providing meaningful (simple and
substantive) rewards to incentivize continued engagement and
performance.

Engagement Analytics: Tools to measure employee engagement
levels, identify trends, and gather feedback to continuously improve
the work environment. The need to track and adjust was a core
belief in how CSL approached the program.

After extensive research and evaluation, the client partnered with
Abundantly, a leading provider of employee engagement and recognition
solutions.

When employees feel recognized
and appreciated for their hard work
and contributions, they are more
likely to feel valued and invested in
their job. This can lead to increased
job satisfaction, improved
productivity, and decreased turnover
rates.
