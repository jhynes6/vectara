Abundanty Case Study

Transcosmos Boosted Engagement and Retention in Months

Transcosmos, a customer relationship company, faced rising attrition,
low employee recognition, and KPIs that rewarded speed over quality.
Only one in three service representatives felt appreciated, and annual
voluntary turnover exceeded 25%. HR set out to design a scalable, fair,
and impactful recognition program that would celebrate quality,
empathy, and proactive problem‑solving—ultimately improving
engagement, retention, and customer satisfaction.

The “Resolve & Shine” program was
launched for all CSRs. It featured
real‑time appreciation messages from
peers and managers, automated
badges tied to performance data,
customer feedback moments, and
quarterly “Customer Hero” awards with
client participation. Rewards included
experiences, learning opportunities, and
charitable giving options, making
recognition meaningful and personal.

Within a year, attrition dropped from 25.8% to 17.4%, early‑tenure
attrition declined sharply, and employee Net Promoter Score
(eNPS) rose from +7 to +24. Customer outcomes also improved
significantly, with First Contact Resolution climbing to 83.4% and
Net Promoter Score (NPS) increasing to +38. For HR leaders, the
return on investment was clear: reduced turnover costs, higher
engagement, and a stronger link between recognition and
customer success.

By aligning recognition with meaningful outcomes and
embedding it into the daily flow of work, HR created a system
that was fair, motivating, and sustainable. Employees felt
celebrated not just for speed, but for quality and empathy—
behaviors that matter most to both customers and the business.
The program also freed managers to focus on coaching rather
than administrative recognition tasks.
