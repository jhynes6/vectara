Completely White Labeled Platform

Abundantly lets your company create a fully branded experience within the

platform, including logos, images, titles, naming conventions, colors, fonts, and

custom recognition and reward options. Together, this makes it feel like software

coming that is yours. And that helps increase usage and

engagement from employees.

Printable & In-Person Recognition

80% of workers in the US are deskless - meaning their work doesn't require them

to sit behind a computer. We provide easy-to-create and print thank-yous and

certificates so you can recognize these team members in person. And get the

rest of your employees involved too!

Corporate Philanthropy

Don’t let your company’s philanthropic goals take away from letting your

employees feel rewarded. With Abundantly, we create win-win solutions,

like reward matching. When they cash in their reward points, you match a

percentage of that monetary value as a gift to a cause of their choice. This

means they feel recognized, engaged, and good about helping someone

in their local area.
