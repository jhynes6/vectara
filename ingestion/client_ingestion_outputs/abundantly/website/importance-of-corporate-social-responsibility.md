# Importance of Corporate Social Responsibility

![social responsibility](https://abundantly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Importance-of-Corporate-Social-Responsibility-300x204.png)

Everyone has a duty to the well-being of their community and society as a whole. But while most tips like recycling and being engaged in local politics are focused on the individual, there is also an element of corporate social responsibility. By focusing on corporate social responsibility (CSR) and improving their corporate culture, companies can work toward creating better workplaces and better communities as a whole.

## **What Is Corporate Social Responsibility?**

Corporate social responsibility, or CSR, refers to a company’s commitment to bettering their workplace, their community, and our world, usually through environmental or social initiatives. This may mean giving back to the community or changing the company culture to be more sustainable and green, reducing waste. These are implemented and regulated by the company itself, often by HR Directors interested in boosting CSR.

However, it’s not just for executives. Employee engagement is also a key part of corporate social responsibility. With helpful apps like [Abundantly](https://www.benefitoneusa.com/), HR Directors can easily involve employees in CSR initiatives and offer rewards to those who take part, even through remote work.

## **Examples of Corporate Social Responsibility**

Corporate social responsibility can look different from company to company. It depends on the capacity of the corporation, as well as the areas where the company is passionate. However, some examples of CSR that are commonly seen include:

*   Reducing carbon footprint or reducing waste
*   Taking part in charities or local fundraisers for a good cause
*   Opting for more ethical sourcing
*   Making an effort for more diversity and inclusion in the workplace
*   Making products or working with vendors that are cruelty-free

Plans to reduce the company’s carbon footprint or create a more diverse workplace can easily be tracked and rewarded through Abundantly. Allow employees to track certain steps, such as recycling or attending training seminars, and reward them for achievements easily. Employees can even suggest CSR ideas themselves.

## **Benefits of Corporate Social Responsibility**

Corporate social responsibility has a number of benefits, not just for the community but for the company itself. A few common benefits of corporate social responsibility are:

*   **Brand recognition and reputation.** A socially conscious company is a company that stands out. When a business makes a name for itself by bettering its community, it boosts its brand.
*   **Customer loyalty.** Customers often look for companies with values that line up with their own. When they see a company taking steps to make the world a better place, they are more likely to come back to that company…perhaps even exclusively.
*   **Workplace morale and hiring.** Can corporate social responsibility impact work? Often, involving the whole workplace in these efforts to improve the environment and community can make employees feel happier and more fulfilled at work. It also gives an edge when searching for new talent.
*   **Social betterment.** Sometimes it feels as though every step towards environmental and social progress is simply a drop in the ocean. However, the more companies engage in corporate social responsibility, the more they can set an example for others, and little by little, their community improves.
