# Food and Bev jobs can be draining. Let your team know they’re valued.

Your staff are the ones who ultimately define the customer’s experience! Abundantly makes it easy to reward employees who go the extra mile to make sure your customers are happy. Actions, both big and small, can make a difference, and we have ways to show your appreciation for every type of action and role.

## How Does Abundantly Work?

## 01
### You notice your chef remaking a dish for a customer before they even ask.
Sometimes a simple gesture from one of your team members can create an unexpectedly amazing experience for your customers. Recognize that hard work.

## 02
### The next day, you give them a thank you card for their hard work in your daily pre-service meeting.
The thank you card also has a reward code attached they can cash in when they log back in to the Abundantly App.

## 03
### In this case, they chose an Amazon Echo product provided by Amazon.
Our platform is powered by Amazon for Business, giving employees millions of reward options, even Amazon specific products.

## 04
### Their reward is delivered directly to their door.
Because of our Amazon integration, your employees can get their rewards anywhere Amazon delivers (which is basically everywhere).

## 05
### Employees can celebrate their wins with friends, family, and team members.
When employees feel valued, it leads to 31% less voluntary turnover. Plus, that feeling spreads to the people around them.

## Give your employees another reason to come to work
From the cooking line to the front register, good employees can be tough to find. When your employees feel appreciated, they’re 31% less likely to voluntarily leave and 30% more productive (according to Gartner research). That means a more efficient workplace, which in turn, leads to an even better employee and customer experience.

## Hey! We’re Abundantly
You may not have heard of us (we’re pretty new), but we know employee recognition. Our leaders come from companies like OC Tanner, Limeade, and Thanks.com. We created Abundantly because we saw a need for a modern recognition product that meets the needs of evolving companies and their employees, no matter where or how they work.
At the end of the day, we just want to help companies create meaningful connections, and create positive change across people, teams, and communities through what we call the _recognition ripple effect._
