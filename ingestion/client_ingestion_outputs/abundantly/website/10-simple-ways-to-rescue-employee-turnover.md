# 10 Simple Ways to Rescue Employee Turnover

The lessons of the “Great Resignation” continues to reinforce that employee engagement is more important than ever before. Employers across industries are finding that old strategies, like bonuses and meager annual raises, aren’t enough. There needs to be a shift in corporate culture for team members to stick around.

## 1. Focus on Onboarding

An employee’s first few days set the tone for their entire tenure with a company. From day one, every team member should receive the tools they need to succeed and have a support system they can tap into.

## 2. Make Dialogue the Norm

Employee engagement is highest when the line of communication is open. Managers can improve their retention rates by regularly offering feedback and keeping employees in the loop. Employees should also feel like they can ask for and receive honest feedback.

## 3. Offer Growth Opportunities

If employees don’t see a future where they work, they’ll start looking somewhere else. Companies that want to retain their top talent need to find ways to offer upward mobility and help employees realize their potential.

## 4. Offer Remote Work Solutions

Now that people have enjoyed a taste of the work-from-home lifestyle, flexibility is more popular than ever before. Whenever possible, companies should provide employees with options for their work location and even their schedule.

## 5. Commit to Transparency

Managers should keep the line of communication open with employees. This includes updating them on developments within the company, even if it’s not always good news.

## 6. Have an Open-Door Policy

People appreciate feeling that their contributions are valuable. When managers invite team members to share their thoughts and ideas openly, without fear of judgment, employee engagement increases.

## 7. Care About Employees as People

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the difference between companies that care about people and those that focus only on their bottom lines. If an organization falls into the former category, it’s much more likely that the company will retain conscientious employees.

The best strategy is a corporate policy that encourages wellness, but managers can make a difference, too. This can be as simple as extending a deadline when someone is particularly stressed.

## 8. Build a Community

People who like their jobs often talk about having good friends at work — people they enjoy talking to and seeing every day. Managers can’t force friendships, but they can create a supportive and sociable company culture.

## 9. Highlight Meaning and Purpose

Humans are naturally inclined to seek out work that matters. They’re less likely to leave their jobs if they know that what they do makes a difference.

Managers can improve retention by highlighting the impact work has on:

* The team as a whole and individual coworkers
* The organization’s goals
* The client

Employees need to know they don’t have to change organizations or careers to make a difference.

## 10. Offer Relevant Rewards

Appreciation is the path to creating better workplaces. Instead of relying on outdated employee-of-the-month programs, managers and executives should look for ways to recognize specific accomplishments and efforts.

Rewards should be meaningful to the individual being recognized. Some people prefer public recognition, whereas others prefer private rewards. Listening to people is the best way to learn what works.
