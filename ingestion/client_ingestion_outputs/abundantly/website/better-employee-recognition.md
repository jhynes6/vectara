# Finally, Recognition And Rewards Built For Every Employee.

Only 20% of workers sit behind a computer. We built a platform to enhance the work experience for the other 80%. Abundantly goes beyond rewards, offering sincere recognition and a genuine connection with your organization and its people.

## How Abundantly Works

## 01
### Provide Employees With In-Person And On-The-Spot Recognition
Empower your team with real-time recognition. Whether it’s a printed thank you note, a heartfelt card, or a personalized certificate, Abundantly ensures every achievement is celebrated right where it happens – at stand-ups, team meetings, or on the floor.

## 02
### Let Them Cash In Their Reward Points Within The App
Make rewards personal and convenient. Employees can now redeem their points instantly, choosing from millions of options from Amazon. It’s flexibility that boosts engagement.

## 03
### Employees Earn Towards The Rewards They Want - Provided And Delivered By Amazon
Our platform is powered by Amazon for Business, giving employees millions of reward options. Plus you can also have gift cards, custom in house rewards, and experiences – all without any markup, ever.

## 04
### Employees Can Celebrate Their Wins With Friends, Family, And Team Members
Recognizing success isn’t just about rewards – it’s about fostering a culture of appreciation that reduces turnover by 31%. With Abundantly, celebrate achievements together and watch your team thrive.

## Abundantly Isn't Just About Rewards, It's About Unlocking The Full Potential Of Your People
Our platform goes beyond just rewards. It lets you recognize **everyone**, anywhere – with an online platform, mobile app, and even printed thank you notes. **Employees choose** how they want to be recognized, making it real and meaningful for everyone.

## Hey! We’re Abundantly
You may not have heard of us (we’re pretty new), but we know employee recognition. Our leaders come from companies like OC Tanner, Limeade, and Thanks.com. We created Abundantly because we saw a need for a modern recognition product that meets the needs of evolving companies and their employees, no matter where or how they work.

At the end of the day, we just want to help companies create meaningful connections, and create positive change across people, teams, and communities through what we call the _recognition ripple effect._
