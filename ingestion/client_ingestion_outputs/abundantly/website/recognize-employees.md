# Empower Your Team with Better Recognition Tools

Give your team a new way to engage and recognize one another with Abundantly’s easy to use platform. Plus, employees have more reward options with our Amazon powered reward experience.

## Team engagement with corporate culture impacts.

You may be jaded by an outdated platform that made promises of increased productivity and high ROI. We understand that the recognition and rewards industry has needed a change, and Abundantly is here to do just that.

### Peer to peer recognition that reinforces your company values.

Abundantly is designed to be simple to use and encourage team members to come back and engage regularly with one another. Plus, when they provide any type of praise, recognition, or reward, they can tie it to one of your company’s core values, helping HR organically build this into your team’s process.

### Are you still bringing in the monthly cake to celebrate milestones?

Flash back to the early 2000s. Someone in your office had an outdated excel spreadsheet of birthdays and start dates. A cake showed up in the breakroom several times a month with lackluster singing. Yes, it’s time to change the way you recognize milestones at work. Abundantly not only automates these announcements, it puts the control in your employees hands and lets them get gifts they want…not a vanilla cake.

### Personalized Recognition for Wins Big and Small

It’s easy to email the whole company to congratulate them. It’s harder to send everyone an individualized message, but not with Abundantly. Our interface lets you quickly craft notes, make each message unique from the last, and reward points for a job well done – whether that’s finishing a major milestone or just coming in early to ensure today’s kick off meeting kicks a$$.

### A reward system with options, that's also easy to manage.

Abundantly not only gives your company the tools to better connect with one another, but our platform is powered by Amazon’s fulfillment, providing you with millions of choices in the countries where your employees live. Looking for other options? We also integrate with gift card providers, experiential rewards, and custom company perk/swag offerings.

### Are you still bringing in the monthly cake to celebrate milestones?

Everyone loves the idea of giving to charitable causes, but it can be hard to implement into your recognition program. Abundantly simplifies this process. Let employees claim rewards AND provide a percentage to a charity of their choice. You choose how much you give on top of an employee’s reward so everyone wins.

### Pricing that’s as simple to understand as our software.

Most recognition platforms make their money on complex and convoluted pricing. Monthly subscriptions and extra fees can add up quickly. Abundantly provides you with a straightforward pricing plan without any markups or hidden fees, ever. See how much you’ll actually spend with our estimator.

## Hey! We’re Abundantly

You may not have heard of us (we’re pretty new), but we know employee recognition. Our leaders come from companies like OC Tanner, Limeade, and Thanks.com. We created Abundantly because we saw a need for a modern recognition product that meets the needs of evolving companies and their employees, no matter where or how they work.

At the end of the day, we just want to help companies create meaningful connections, and create positive change across people, teams, and communities through what we call the _recognition ripple effect._
