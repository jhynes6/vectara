# We are Abundantly

Our recognition solution provides companies cultivate meaningful connections and create positive change across people, teams, and communities thru what we call the **recognition ripple effect**.

### People

When people are lifted up and are told they are valued, they not only thrive on that sentiment – it becomes a potential catalyst.

### Company

When employees thrive, your organization thrives too. Each time you acknowledge an employee, it spreads positivity and real benefits throughout your company.

### Community

By paying recognition forward, your organization is making a difference in your community, and in turn the world at large.

**Engage**

When employees feel recognized and appreciated for their hard work, they are more likely to continue to exhibit positive behaviors and work hard. Abundantly provides positive reinforcement and can help employees feel valued and appreciated.

**Elevate**

Let’s build on the culture of your company. We can help create a sense of community and encourage employees to support and appreciate one another. This will create a positive feedback loop that fosters a culture of appreciation and engagement.

**Empower**

When Abundantly is built into the culture of a company, your employees will feel recognized and appreciated, they are more likely to stay with their employer. Employee recognition can help reduce turnover and retain top talent.

## The best fit for every organization

One powerful case study that demonstrates the impact of employee recognition on company culture is the example of KFC. The program, called “Fired with Pride,” is designed to recognize employees who demonstrate exceptional performance and behavior that aligns with the company’s core values. In a challenging working environment, the program has also had a positive impact on employee engagement and motivation, with employees reporting higher levels of job satisfaction and loyalty to the company.
