# At the intersection of technology and humanity is Abundantly

## So many way to say it

## Empowering Deskless

We make recognition for deskless  
workers a priority – because everyone  
deserves to be appreciated.

*We make it easy to stay engaged with every employee, whether they are remote, deskless, or in-person.*

## Hey! We’re Abundantly

You may not have heard of us (we’re pretty new), but we know employee recognition. Our leaders come from companies like OC Tanner, Limeade, and Thanks.com. We created Abundantly because we saw a need for a modern recognition product that meets the needs of evolving companies and their employees, no matter where or how they work.

At the end of the day, we just want to help companies create meaningful connections, and create positive change across people, teams, and communities through what we call the _recognition ripple effect._ [Learn more about us.](https://abundantly.com/about-us/)
