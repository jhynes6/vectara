# Finally, recognition built for the deskless worker

80% of the workforce is considered “deskless,” so we built a platform that improves their work experience. And it’s not just about rewards. It’s about sincere recognition and a place to connect with the company and the people in it in a real way.

## How Abundantly Works

### 01

### Provide employees with in person and on-the-spot recognition via printable thank yous, cards, and certificates.

This means people get recognized in front of their peers on the floor and can celebrate their victories as a team.

### 02

### Let them cash in their reward points within the app at their convenience.

You don’t have to rely on the digital experience all of the time, which means more engaged employees. 

### 03

### Employees earn towards the rewards they want, provided and delivered by Amazon.

Our platform is powered by Amazon for Business, giving employees millions of reward options. Plus you can also have gift cards, custom in house rewards, and experiences – all without any markup, ever.

### 04

### Employees can celebrate their wins with friends, family, and team members.

When employees feel valued, it leads to 31% less voluntary turnover. Plus, that feeling spreads to the people around them.

### People are your most valuable asset…so start acting like it.

We’ve built a system that creates opportunities to reward all of your workers, including an online platform, mobile app, printed thank yous, and physical cards. Plus, we put the control of how and when they want to be recognized in the employees hands, so every interaction is sincere.

## Hey! We’re Abundantly

You may not have heard of us (we’re pretty new), but we know employee recognition. Our leaders come from companies like OC Tanner, Limeade, and Thanks.com. We created Abundantly because we saw a need for a modern recognition product that meets the needs of evolving companies and their employees, no matter where or how they work.

At the end of the day, we just want to help companies create meaningful connections, and create positive change across people, teams, and communities through what we call the _recognition ripple effect._
