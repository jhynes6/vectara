# Comprehensive Guide To Company Benefits: What Employees Really Want

The workforce landscape has shifted dramatically, and so too have the expectations of employees.

Gone are the days when employees were content with a basic salary and the occasional pat on the back. Today, employees seek meaningful connections, purpose, and benefits that reflect their evolving needs. This shift calls for a fresh approach to employee benefits—a comprehensive strategy that aligns with both organizational goals and the genuine desires of our workforce.

To retain current staff and attract new talent, organizations must understand and address key retention and recruitment challenges, as highlighted in [a recent SHRM Research report](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/report-hr-pros-rank-top-reasons-turnover). This is not just about ticking boxes; it’s about fostering an environment where your team feels valued, motivated, and invested in the company’s success.

## The Importance Of A Well-Crafted Benefits Package

According to research by [the Society of Human Resource Management (SHRM)](https://www.shrm.org/home), 92% of employees consider employment benefits as important to their job satisfaction.

But the implications go further. Burnout and turnover are two of the most significant challenges we face. When employees feel undervalued, they are more likely to burn out and, consequently, seek opportunities elsewhere.

On the flip side, a thoughtfully designed benefits package can mitigate these risks by showing employees that their well-being is a priority. In fact, 71% of employees would be less likely to leave their organization if they were recognized more frequently.

## What Employees Really Want

The answer varies, but there are several core benefits that consistently top the list across industries. Here’s a closer look at these, along with insights on how to tailor them to meet your team’s specific needs.

### 1. Health And Wellness Benefits

* **Medical, Dental, & Vision Insurance**. These are the cornerstones of any benefits package. However, the expectation now is for these offerings to be comprehensive and easily accessible. Employees appreciate plans that cover a wide range of services and include options for both in-person and virtual consultations.
* **Mental Health Support**. Companies that offer mental health resources, such as counseling services, mental health days, and stress management programs, are seen as more empathetic and supportive.
* **Wellness Programs**. Beyond traditional health insurance, employees are looking for programs that promote a healthy lifestyle. This includes gym memberships, wellness apps, nutrition counseling, and even meditation classes. These benefits signal that the company cares about the holistic well-being of its employees.

### 2. Retirement And Financial Planning

* **Retirement Plans (401k, Pension Plans)**. Employees are increasingly concerned about their financial futures, and retirement plans are a critical part of this. A well-structured 401k plan with company matching contributions is a powerful tool for attracting and retaining talent.
* **Financial Wellness Programs**. In addition to retirement plans, financial wellness programs that offer advice on budgeting, saving, and investing are becoming more popular. Employees want to feel secure in their financial decisions, both now and in the future.

### 3. Work-Life Balance

* **Flexible Working Arrangements**. Flexibility in where and when they work is no longer a perk; it’s a necessity. Companies that offer [remote work options](https://abundantly.com/remote-working/), flexible hours, and compressed workweeks are more attractive to top talent.
* **Paid Time Off (PTO)**. Adequate vacation time, sick leave, and personal days are crucial for maintaining work-life balance. Some companies are even adopting unlimited PTO policies, trusting employees to manage their time effectively.
* **Parental Leave**. Parental leave policies that go beyond the minimum requirements show a commitment to supporting employees during significant life changes. This includes not just maternity leave, but paternity leave and options for extended family leave as well.

### 4. Career Development Opportunities

* **Training & Development**. Employees want to grow in their roles, and they seek employers who invest in their development. Offering professional development opportunities, whether through formal education programs, certifications, or on-the-job training, is essential.
* **Mentorship Programs**. Pairing employees with mentors can be a powerful way to foster growth and development. These relationships help employees navigate their careers and feel supported in their professional journey.

## Implementing And Managing Employee Benefits

Let’s talk about how to implement these benefits effectively. This process involves several key steps: understanding your workforce, budgeting, communication, and ongoing management.

### 1. Understanding Your Workforce

* **Employee Surveys**. The best way to know what benefits your employees want is to ask them. [Regular surveys can provide valuable insights](https://abundantly.com/lifting-company-culture-through-employee-surveys/) into their preferences and pain points. This data should guide your benefits strategy.
* **Demographic Analysis**. Consider the demographics of your workforce. Younger employees might prioritize student loan assistance and career development, while older employees might value retirement planning and healthcare.

### 2. Budgeting

* **Cost Analysis**. Benefits are an investment, but they need to be balanced with financial realities. Conduct a cost-benefit analysis to determine which benefits offer the most value for both the company and the employees.
* **Prioritization**. Not all benefits need to be offered at once. Start with the most impactful benefits and expand as the company grows.

### 3. Communication

* **Clear Messaging**. One of the biggest challenges with benefits is that employees often don’t fully understand what’s available to them. Clear, consistent communication is key. Use multiple channels—emails, intranet, meetings—to ensure everyone is aware of their options.
* **Customization**. Different employees value different benefits. Personalized communication that highlights the benefits most relevant to each individual can increase engagement and utilization.

### 4. Ongoing Management

* **Regular Reviews**. The effectiveness of your benefits package should be reviewed regularly. This includes analyzing utilization rates, employee feedback, and staying updated on industry trends.
* **Adaptation**. The workforce is constantly evolving, and so too should your benefits package. Be prepared to adapt and introduce new benefits as the needs of your employees change.

## Employee Benefit Insights For Business Leaders

Every employer must tailor their benefits decisions to their unique circumstances, data, and principles. However, [the 2024 SHRM Employee Benefits Survey](https://www.shrm.org/enterprise-solutions/insights/2024-shrm-employee-benefits-survey-takeaways) provides valuable insights that can guide your choices and enhance employee engagement, productivity, and retention.

Here are some important takeaways:

### Prioritize Compliance

With increasing scrutiny on benefits like paid leave and retirement savings, it’s essential to stay updated on federal, state, and local regulations. Ensure your benefits policies comply with current laws and anticipate upcoming regulations to avoid any legal pitfalls.

### Standardize Paid-Leave Policies

Paid leave now goes beyond just vacation and sick leave, with various states implementing different laws. Consider a standardized policy that meets or exceeds the most stringent laws applicable to your organization. This approach can simplify administration, prevent errors, and ensure fairness in leave policies.

### Communicate Financial & Retirement Benefits Clearly

Many employers offer retirement savings plans like 401(k)s and employer matches, but it’s crucial to communicate these benefits effectively. Ensure your employees understand how to enroll and the long-term importance of these benefits. Regularly highlight other financial perks, such as nonretirement financial advice, credit unions, and payroll advances, to boost employee loyalty.

### Align Professional Development With Future Skill Needs

Assess your organization’s current skills and compare them to the skills needed in the future. This analysis will help you shape professional development programs to upskill or reskill employees effectively. By identifying necessary skills for each role, you can also refine your recruitment strategy, potentially reducing the need for extensive training later on.
