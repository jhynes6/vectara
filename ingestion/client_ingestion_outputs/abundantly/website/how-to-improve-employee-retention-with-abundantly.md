# How To Improve Employee Retention With Abundantly

![Reduce Turnover](https://abundantly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/How-To-Improve-Employee-Retention-With-Abundantly-300x204.png)

Retaining top talent starts with understanding why employees leave. It’s not just about bigger paychecks—though compensation is crucial—many employees seek more meaningful opportunities for career growth, alignment with company culture, feeling valued, and a sense of belonging.

Since the pandemic, the reasons people choose to leave have become more complicated. Workers are burned out. Many now prioritize a better life for themselves and their families over traditional job security. Flexibility, purpose, and a strong connection to their work culture are now non-negotiables.

Recent research from [the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov/) highlights the urgency of addressing employee retention. 

According to [a Gartner study from late 2021](https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/great-resignation-or-not-money-won-t-fix-all-your-talent-problems), employee turnover rates are expected to be 50-75% higher than what companies have previously experienced. Additionally, 65% of employees are reassessing the role work plays in their lives, with only one-third seeing opportunities within their current organization that support their work-life balance. 

[The MIT Sloan Management Review (SMR)](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/five-ways-to-strengthen-the-employee-employer-relationship-in-2023/) echoes these concerns, noting that employee dissatisfaction often stems from a lack of engagement, trust, and recognition, especially in remote work environments. CEOs, middle managers, and individual contributors all feel the pressure. Leaders face mass resignations, middle managers are increasingly overburdened, and employees struggle with the lack of trust to perform their jobs remotely.  

Beyond the financial costs of turnover, the impact on morale and customer relationships is significant. Losing your best people—those who drive innovation and solve problems—can ripple through your entire organization.
