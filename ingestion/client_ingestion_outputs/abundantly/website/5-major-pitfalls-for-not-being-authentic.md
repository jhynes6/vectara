# 5 Major Pitfalls for not Being Authentic

![build culture](https://abundantly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/blog-498407922-1-300x204.png)

Since being authentic means being your true self, when offering up recognition and appreciation at the workplace, the reward should come from the heart and be of real value. As many know, reward programs greatly influence employee experience and engagement, with [85% of companies](https://abundantly.com/) that invest in reward programs seeing a positive RIO on their investment. But when perks and benefits given as a reward program are seen as not being authentic, the best efforts put into the program can become counterproductive and sometimes damaging.

**Ways to be Perceived as Not Authentic**

All best intentions are not the same. Some forms of saying thank you can be seen as self-serving and not genuine. Such as:

*   Giving out swag with promo company logos
*   Donating to a company charity instead of a charity valued by the employee
*   Offering marked-up merchandise

**The Effect of Not Being Authentic to Employees**

Employees who feel you are not being authentic will act differently at the workplace vs. those that believe the recognition is genuine. The many pitfalls come from:

**Seen as Lacking Integrity**

When a person is not being authentic, they are viewed as someone willing to lie for self-benefit or ready to act against their own moral belief. People who lack integrity will repel people or employees from wanting to work for them. Also, there is the potential that those viewed to possess no integrity attract others with no integrity and become prime targets for criminal acts, such as theft.

**Lose the Trust of Others**

[Though 77% of employees trust their employers](https://storiesincorporated.com/who-do-people-trust-most-employees/#:~:text=Employees%20trust%20their%20employers%20the%20most&text=77%20percent%20of%20employees%20trust,the%20media%20\(51%20percent\).), that trust can be lost when people see you as not being authentic. They begin to believe that you are not genuine if you are willing to lie to get what you want. If you say things you don’t mean or give away rewards simply to get something back in return, how can anyone buy into judgments you make or follow your lead?

**Watch How Being Your Authentic Self Brings Success**

**Gain No One’s Respect**

Many view people who are not authentic as shallow and without honesty. And employees are the same. They perceive an action as forced or done with ulterior motives only, as disrespectful. Once this happens, it is harder for employees to engage with the company and act 100% on your decisions.

**Build Poor Relationships**

Since most careers and businesses are built on relationships, if others perceive your actions as selfish or insincere, they are less likely to work with you. And if they must work with you, they are less inclined to communicate and share information or spend time with you and collaborate on projects.

**Loss of Self-Respect**

When you have lost the trust and respect of colleagues and employees, it becomes harder to perform your job, advance in your career, or build your business. You can potentially lose self-confidence, which helps drive your decisions, actions, and beliefs.

**Key Takeaway**

Any action you take when interacting with an employee is better received when it is authentic and comes from the heart. Earning the trust and respect of employees guarantees they are more engaged with the organization and are working harder to meet your goals. If you are worried that you might appear as not being authentic, contact us today to learn more about how to make your employees feel appreciated from the heart.
