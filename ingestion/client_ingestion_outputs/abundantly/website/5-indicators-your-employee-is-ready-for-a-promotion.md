# 5 Indicators Your Employee Is Ready for a Promotion

Clear career paths dramatically increase employee engagement and motivation. In fact, one of the best ways employers can reduce employee turnover is by creating a better workplace that builds a supportive environment and promotes growth. Evaluating and rewarding strong worker performance is essential to improve corporate culture. Read on to learn the top five telltale signs that reveal when someone might be ready for a promotion.

## **1. They’re Actively Asking for One (Or They Have in the Past)**

If an employee asks for a promotion, it doesn’t necessarily guarantee they’ll be able to take on new responsibilities. Some employees who ask for promotions end up biting off more than they can chew. However, an employee who shows initiative and drive is one worth rewarding. Plus, when a person wants a new position, they’re more likely to feel motivated to embrace any new challenges that come their way.

## **2. They Know How To Deal With Failure**

Failing is a vital part of growth, yet not everybody can handle the frustration that often comes with making mistakes or falling short of a goal. A worker that approaches failure with a “what can I learn from this?” mindset is a great role model that could potentially lead a team to grow and thrive. Yes, failure can be difficult to overcome, but it’s also an opportunity for improvement. If an employee is able to see this, they might be ready for a greater role.

## **3. They Know Their Worth**

An employee that can understand their own value within a team or organization is worth their weight in gold. They require less micromanagement and are able to work themselves into higher-value positions by producing consistent and scalable results. Motivated individuals who know where they want to go in the corporate world can positively impact work when in a leadership role.

## **4. They Identify Critical Issues**

No company is flawless. Successful businesses rely on their management and personnel to identify and resolve organizational problems that could be costing unnecessary time, effort, and resources. An employee who’s not satisfied with the status quo could be great at a higher-value position. After all, who wouldn’t want highly-engaged individuals that actively seek to transform and streamline processes within the company taking on leadership roles?

## **5. They’ve Mastered Their Role**

Having employees understand duties and masterfully perform them could sound ideal. But no company should be wasting employee talent by getting people stuck in the same position indefinitely just because it’s comfortable. If a worker has nothing else to learn from their current role, this could be a sign it’s time to move on. Otherwise, a person may quickly lose interest and motivation.

## **Final Remarks**

Demonstrating career advancement possibilities is a great way to improve company culture because it shows that growth opportunities are available. This is essential to attract and retain top-level talent. By constantly monitoring employee performance and listening to their needs regarding promotions and mobility, you’ll show your workers you care about them and their professional growth.
