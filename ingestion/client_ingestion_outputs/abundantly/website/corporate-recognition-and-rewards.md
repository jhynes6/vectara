# Recognition and rewards your employees will actually like.

There is recognition and then there is good recognition. We’ve built Abundantly to make it easy to implement better recognition programs, with more authentic connections, and backed with rewards that employees really want.

# Next Generation of Employee Engagement and Recognition

Give everyone in your organization a new and innovative way to engage, recognize, and lift each other with Abundantly. Our AI-powered platform is customizable to fit every organization at a single, low price. We’re all about healthy engagement, our team is always an email or phone call away to make implementation, management, and maintenance of Abundantly a breeze.

## More authentic recognition with the help of AI.

One of the biggest challenges with recognition platforms is getting users to write authentic notes when showing their appreciation or providing a point reward. Our system leverages AI to help managers write those _thank you_ notes more quickly and with real intention, so every interaction is more genuine.

## Multiple reward categories and millions of reward options

With Abundantly, you can provide physical rewards, gift cards, and company-specific rewards, so everyone can find something that satisfies them. Our reward system is powered by Amazon, with millions of options delivered directly to your employees’ doors. Plus, your company can create custom rewards like an extra day off, cafeteria credits, or preferred parking for people who want something memorable.

## Recognize your employees in person with printed Thank Yous

Sometimes, a digital note isn’t possible or doesn’t quite show your gratitude. Abundantly gives you the ability to print custom thank yous and certificates to show your appreciation in a real way. Plus, attach a points code to the note, so your employees can cash in their rewards at their convenience.
