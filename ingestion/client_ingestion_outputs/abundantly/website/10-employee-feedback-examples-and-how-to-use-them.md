# 10 Employee Feedback Examples and How to Use Them

Consistent feedback in an organization can help employees identify their strengths and weaknesses and improve their overall careers. By giving employees constructive feedback regarding their skills, behaviors, and performances, managers can set their employees up to succeed in their careers.

Here are employee feedback examples and how companies can use them to build a good company culture.

## **10 Ways To Give Constructive Employee Feedback**

Whether it’s positive or constructive feedback, leaders should find ways to give constructive feedback.

### **1. Rate Employees’ Performance**

If a worker has good skills, determination, and a strong work ethic, ensure that they feel noticed. According to a [TINYpulse report](https://www.tinypulse.com/blog/sk-employee-recognition-stats), 69% of employees would work harder if they felt that their efforts were recognized.

### **2. Track Employees’ Failures to Achieve a Specific Goal**

If an employee doesn’t meet certain goals, send feedback immediately. If possible, have a one-on-one conversation with the worker to understand the reasons behind the failure and let them know the importance of achieving the company’s goal.

### **3. Avoid Using Feedback to Micromanage Employees**

While frequent feedback is good, too much feedback may make employees feel micromanaged. The number one priority for managers is to empower employees to do their job. When an employee makes a mistake, try to coach them by asking why they did it and what they should have done in a constructive way.

### **4. Show Your Employees Respect When Providing Feedback**

Respect is a two-way street, especially in the workplace. How managers give employee feedback reflects how much respect they have for them. For example, when giving an employee negative feedback, it’s best to do it in private rather than call them out in front of the team. You can do this by scheduling a one-on-one to provide constructive feedback.

### **5. Explain the Reasoning Behind The Feedback**

When employees under-perform, leaders should tell them why. Instead of focusing on their mistakes, managers should show them what should have been done. Be specific about why things need to be done a certain way so that the employee can clearly understand that following a certain procedure is paramount.

### **6. Focus on Behavior Rather Than Personalities When Giving Feedback**

How managers say something can impact the quality of the feedback they give. To ensure that feedback is constructive, they should focus on behavior rather than personalities. For instance, instead of saying _“you’re dishonest,”_ focus on the dishonesty that occurred in the situation.

### **7. Solve Unwanted Behaviors**

Disrespectful behaviors in the workplace, such as gossiping, discriminating, and disrespecting others may affect employees’ performances. Addressing these issues immediately will help avoid problematic behaviors among workers. Feedback should be clear, stating what behaviors are acceptable within the workplace.

### **8. Give Praise Where It’s Due**

Giving employees positive feedback is equally important too. This will go a long way in boosting the morale and productivity of the employee at work. For example, you could say, _“I think you did a great this quarter, company sales went up by 4%.”_

### **9. Address Changes in Performance**

The success of every business is in the hands of the managers. When managers notice a change in performance, they should give feedback as soon as possible. This way, managers can understand the cause of the change and offer support to get the performance back on track.

### **10. Listen to Your Employees After Providing Constructive Feedback**

Giving employees feedback isn’t about appreciating and telling them what they need to improve. It’s also all about making them feel heard. The top management should listen to understand what the employees feel about a specific situation. After knowing their challenges, managers can help them overcome them.

## **Conclusion**

Giving constructive feedback can be challenging, but it can be extremely rewarding and result in highly engaged and productive employees. Whether positive or constructive, giving employees feedback shows that you appreciate them and care about their future.
