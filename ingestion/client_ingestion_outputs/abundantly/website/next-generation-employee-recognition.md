### Millions of Rewards. No Markups.

Abundantly and Amazon Business have teamed up to offer your employees **millions of reward options with no price markups**. Plus, items can be delivered anywhere Amazon delivers in two days, which means more choices for your employees and less management falling on HR’s shoulders.

### 1. Personalized Recognition for Every Moment

Our interface and innovative [AI](https://abundantly.com/ai/) lets you quickly craft unique, personalized notes and reward points for a job well done – whether that’s reaching a major milestone or simply coming in early to ensure a kick off meeting rocks. Abundantly also automates recurring milestone celebrations and lets team members pick memorable rewards they want.

### 2. In-Person Recognition with Impact

Use Abundantly’s pre-built eCards and certificates to create tangible recognition your employees can display and celebrate with other team members.

### 3. Expansive Reward System with Options

Abundantly gives your company access to Amazon’s vast catalog, and we also integrate with gift card providers, experiential rewards, and custom company swag offerings. With us, everyone gets something they find truly rewarding.

### 1. Boost engagement. Not your workload.

Abundantly is simple to use and designed to encourage team members to engage regularly with one another. And once things are running, they run on their own. No system babysitter required.

### 2. Increasing usage by reducing friction

Gone are the days of multi-platform engagement and underutilized recognition programs. Abundantly lets peers connect, send spot rewards, and recognize team contributions (amongst other options) all in one place. _Amplify_, our proprietary AI engine, helps managers and users create impactful, personalized messages to elevate everyone in your organization.

### 3. Give back to your employees and community.

As popular as charitable giving is it can also be difficult to incorporate into your recognition program. With Abundantly, employees can claim their rewards and seamlessly provide a percentage of that reward to a charity of their choice. You, in turn, can choose how much you give on top of an employee’s reward, so everyone wins.

## A force of change in the industry

It’s understandable if you’ve become jaded by an outdated platform that was sold to you with unkept promises of increased productivity and high ROI. The recognition and rewards industry was long overdue for a change, and Abundantly’s next generation platform is just that.
