# Build a Culture & Recognize Employees No Matter Where They Are

Just because your team is remote, doesn’t mean recognition can’t be a part of your corporate culture. Improve team engagement and loyalty with a better recognition solution.

## Tap into the recognition ripple effect.

While employee recognition may start with one person, we know the effects can be felt far beyond that one act. When people feel good about themselves, they pass that feeling of value on to the people around them, and subsequently the larger community. When you have a remote team, that means magnifying impact through a simple reward platform.

### Create a corporate community that’s engaged.

Abundantly is designed to be simple to use and encourage team members to come back and engage regularly with one another. They can either provide praise, recognition, or point based rewards as a way to show your appreciation.

### Recognize employees near and far for their contributions.

When your employees work around the country or around the globe, organic recognition can be tough to foster. Abundantly’s easy to use platform makes it feel natural for managers and employees to engage with each other and feel rewarded for their work.

### Let them choose how they want to be rewarded.

Abundantly not only gives your company the right tools to better connect with one another, but our platform, in partnership with Amazon, provides them with millions of reward choices all fulfilled anywhere around the globe.

### Pricing that’s as simple to understand as our software.

Most recognition platforms make their money on complex and convoluted pricing. Monthly subscriptions and extra fees can add up quickly. Abundantly provides you with a straightforward pricing plan without any markups or hidden fees, ever. See how much you’ll actually spend with our estimator.

## Hey! We’re Abundantly

You may not have heard of us (we’re pretty new), but we know employee recognition. Our leaders come from companies like OC Tanner, Limeade, and Thanks.com. We created Abundantly because we saw a need for a modern recognition product that meets the needs of evolving companies and their employees, no matter where or how they work.

At the end of the day, we just want to help companies create meaningful connections, and create positive change across people, teams, and communities through what we call the _recognition ripple effect._
