# Designing Rewards Programs That Honor Multicultural Festivities And Traditions

Creating a workplace where everyone feels valued starts with recognizing what makes each person unique. Around the world, festivals are rich in tradition and meaning, celebrating themes like togetherness, gratitude, and renewal.
