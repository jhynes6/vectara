![Benefits that help employees](https://abundantly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/10-benefits-300x204.png)

Let’s face it: the job market is a highly competitive field. Every company is fighting tooth and nail to attract and retain top talent. In 2021, [the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/) reported [47.8 million people quit their jobs](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2022/article/job-openings-and-quits-reach-record-highs-in-2021.htm), marking a 33% increase from the previous year. Employers are under intense pressure to find the right employee benefits that not only attract but also engage and retain top talent—all while staying within budget.

It’s no longer enough to offer a decent salary and some standard benefits. Today’s employees crave more. They want to feel valued, challenged, and cared for.

So, how do you win this competition for talent? The answer is in [creating an irresistible employee experience](https://abundantly.com/). And at the heart of this experience is a benefits package that goes above and beyond.

Abundantly understands that traditional benefits often fall short. Our platform offers not only advanced technology but also comprehensive support to enhance your [employee engagement](https://abundantly.com/employee-communication/) and recognition efforts. 

Here’s our top ten employee benefits that can make a real difference in retaining your best people.

### 1. Health Insurance

Comprehensive health insurance that covers medical, dental, and vision care is fundamental to ensuring employee well-being. Offering extensive coverage demonstrates a commitment to your employees’ health, which in turn can reduce absenteeism and increase job satisfaction.

### 2. Retirement Plans (401(k) & Pension Plans)

Providing retirement savings plans, such as 401(k) options with employer matching or pension plans, gives employees a sense of financial security. These benefits not only help employees plan for the future but also encourage long-term commitment to the company, as they see a clear path to a stable retirement.

### 3. Paid Time Off (PTO)

Offering generous PTO policies, including vacation days, sick leave, and holidays, plays a vital role in promoting work-life balance. Employees who can take time off to recharge are more productive and engaged when they return to work, making PTO a key factor in employee retention.

### 4. Flexible Work Arrangements

Flexibility in the workplace, such as telecommuting options and flexible hours, has become increasingly important in today’s work environment. These arrangements allow employees to balance their professional and personal lives more effectively, leading to higher job satisfaction and loyalty.

### 5. Mental Health Benefits

Providing access to mental health services, including counseling and therapy, is crucial in today’s high-pressure work environments. By supporting your employees’ mental well-being, you can enhance their productivity, reduce burnout, and create a more supportive and inclusive workplace culture.

### 6. Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs)

EAPs offer confidential counseling and support for a wide range of personal and work-related issues, from stress management to financial counseling. These programs help employees navigate challenges more effectively, leading to improved morale and reduced turnover.

### 7. Child & Dependent Care Benefits

Childcare and dependent care benefits have become increasingly critical, with [56% of companies identifying them as their most important issue in 2024](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-05/us-companies-push-child-care-benefits-for-staff-to-better-work-life-balance?utm_source=newsshowcase&utm_medium=gnews&utm_campaign=CDAqEAgAKgcICjDi7PAKMIXduwIw0fH0AQ&utm_content=bullets&gaa_at=la&gaa_n=AZsHK_mfm6fMRjiGCv9nsGq6RrKSffXbd68fAhZQkH6Ggg_9B7ejLq1-uhpwe_JF_Y_Y_rT06IHTTRiY5zOQzmzbtH-t&gaa_ts=65e8aaae&gaa_sig=P8YKM_dGP323irB3MyEdKzJix9RKZzsaoExWsBNGS_3GuKyDu9f4MWSdIsF9iR7q2wSBh_NVTflrPNmWGQgKzQ%3D%3D&sref=db2f3qgr)—up from 46% last year. This rise in importance surpasses even paid family leave and mental health benefits, reflecting the growing need to support employees with family responsibilities. 

Offering benefits like on-site childcare or subsidies for daycare services can significantly ease the burden on working parents and caregivers, enabling them to focus better on their work and remain loyal to the company.

### 8. Fertility Benefits

Fertility treatments, such as IVF, are becoming a sought-after benefit as more employees prioritize starting or expanding their families. Providing coverage for these services not only supports employees in their personal lives but also helps attract and retain top talent who value this support.

### 9. Telemedicine

Telemedicine services offer employees convenient access to healthcare without the need to visit a doctor’s office. This benefit can reduce absenteeism, as employees can address health concerns quickly and efficiently, keeping them healthier and more productive.

### 10. Life & Disability Insurance

Offering life and disability insurance provides financial protection for employees and their families in case of unforeseen events. This benefit demonstrates that you care about your employees’ long-term security, making them more likely to stay with a company that looks out for their well-being.

## How Employee Benefits Can Reduce Turnover

Employee benefits play a significant role in reducing turnover by addressing key aspects of job satisfaction and loyalty. Here’s how:

### Creating A Sense Of Value & Security

Comprehensive benefits such as health insurance, retirement plans, and paid time off make employees feel valued and secure. When employees know their well-being is a priority, they’re less likely to look for opportunities elsewhere. A strong benefits package signals that a company is invested in their employees’ long-term happiness and stability.

### Enhancing Work-Life Balance

Benefits like flexible work arrangements and child care support help employees manage their personal and professional lives more effectively. This balance reduces stress and burnout, leading to higher job satisfaction and retention. Employees who can balance work with their personal responsibilities are more likely to stay with a company that supports their lifestyle needs.

### Supporting Personal & Professional Growth

Offering benefits such as professional development opportunities and wellness programs helps employees grow both personally and professionally. When employees see that a company is committed to their growth and well-being, they are more likely to feel engaged and loyal. Investing in employees’ growth creates a positive work environment that encourages long-term commitment.

### Building A Positive Workplace Culture

Perks that promote team-building and a supportive culture contribute to a positive work environment. Regular team activities and recognition programs foster camaraderie and loyalty, making employees feel more connected to their organization. A positive culture reduces turnover by creating an environment where employees feel appreciated and included.

## Best Practices For Your Employee Benefits Package

When creating your employee benefits package, keep these best practices in mind:

* **Offer Relevant Benefits**. Ensure the benefits you provide are valuable and useful to your employees. There’s no point in offering perks that go unused.
* **Understand Employee Needs**. Tailor your benefits to meet the specific needs of your workforce. Benefits that resonate with your team are more likely to be utilized.
* **Stay Within Budget**. Balance the benefits you offer with your business’s financial capabilities. Overextending on costly perks can limit your ability to provide other incentives or salary increases.
* **Clear Communication**. Make sure employees are well-informed about the benefits available to them and how to access these perks.
* **Compliance with Laws**. Ensure your benefits package includes all legally required offerings for your business size and location.
