## How Abundantly As A Simple Employee Engagement Platform Creates A Meaningful Impact…

### 1. Boost engagement. Not your workload.

Abundantly is user-friendly and designed to foster regular team engagement. Once set up, the system operates independently, minimizing administrative effort and maximizing engagement.

### 2. Increasing usage by reducing friction

No more juggling multiple platforms! Abundantly centralizes peer-to-peer connections, spot rewards, and recognition tools. Our AI assistant, Amplify, helps craft impactful messages, so every recognition moment resonates.

### 3. Give back to your employees and community.

As popular as charitable giving is, it can also be difficult to incorporate into your recognition program. With Abundantly, employees can claim their rewards and seamlessly provide a percentage of that reward to a charity of their choice. You, in turn, can choose how much you give on top of an employee’s reward, so everyone wins.

## A force of change in the industry

It’s understandable if you’ve become jaded by an outdated platform that was sold to you with unkept promises of increased productivity and high ROI. The recognition and rewards industry was long overdue for a change, and Abundantly’s next generation platform is just that.
