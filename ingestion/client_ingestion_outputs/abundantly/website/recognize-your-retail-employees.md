# Service-based jobs can be draining. Let your team know they’re valued.

Your front-line staff are the ones who ultimately define the customer’s experience! Abundantly makes it easy to reward employees who go the extra mile to make sure your customers are happy. Actions, both big and small, can make a difference, and we have ways to show your appreciation for every type of action and role.

## How Does Abundantly Work?

## 01

### One of your floor employees decides to help their co-worker finish folding clothes.

When someone on the floor goes above and beyond their job without even being asked, it’s worth recognizing that effort so they’ll do it again.

## 02

### You can thank them for helping by sending them a reward on the Abundantly app or giving them a printed thank-you card.

Your employees can easily download our Android or iOS app to send and receive recognition and communicate with their coworkers. Plus, they can cash in points from physical certificates here too.

## 03

### With their reward points, they decide to buy kitchen utensils they've wanted.

Our platform is powered by Amazon for Business, giving employees millions of reward options.

## 04

### Their reward is delivered directly to their door.

Because of our Amazon integration, your employees can get their rewards anywhere Amazon delivers (which is basically everywhere).

## 05

### Your employee celebrates their win by cooking with their family.

When employees feel valued, that feeling spreads to the people around them in what we call the _recognition ripple effect._

## Give your employees another reason to come to work

From the cooking line to the front register, good employees can be tough to find. When your employees feel appreciated, they’re 31% less likely to voluntarily leave and 30% more productive (according to Gartner research). That means a more efficient workplace, which in turn, leads to an even better employee and customer experience.

## Hey! We’re Abundantly

You may not have heard of us (we’re pretty new), but we know employee recognition. Our leaders come from companies like OC Tanner, Limeade, and Thanks.com. We created Abundantly because we saw a need for a modern recognition product that meets the needs of evolving companies and their employees, no matter where or how they work.

At the end of the day, we just want to help companies create meaningful connections, and create positive change across people, teams, and communities through what we call the _recognition ripple effect._
