CHALLENGES

Gomez Trial Attorneys is a leading personal injury law firm in Southern

California. Founded in 2005, the firm has won over $750M for its clients from its

7 physical locations in the San Diego and Riverside areas. The Covid 19

pandemic caused a major decline in client and case volume and a threat to the

firm’s viability. The team enlisted the help of TenStrat to reexamine their

marketing investments and develop and innovative, performance based digital

marketing approach to return to growth.

TenStrat began by creating an analytical view of the Gomez client acquisition

funnel. Working closely with the Gomez team to identify opportunities for

efficient scaling, TenStrat restructured the marketing investments to capture

the demand already generated by this needs based market. In addition, a new

website was created and optimized leading to an increase in conversion rate.
