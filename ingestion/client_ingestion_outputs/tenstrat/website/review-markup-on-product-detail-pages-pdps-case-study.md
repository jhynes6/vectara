## Client:

Ecommerce Website in the Toys Industry

## Situation:

Our client, an ecommerce website in the toys industry, displayed product reviews from Bazaarvoice on their Product Detail Pages (PDPs). However, the product aggregateRating review markup was not being utilized, which meant that product star ratings and the total number of reviews were not appearing in Google search results.

## Challenge:

To fully leverage the product reviews, we needed to work with both the client’s development team and Bazaarvoice to implement aggregateRating structured data on the PDPs, ensuring that review rich snippets could be displayed in search results.

## Solution:

We used Bazaarvoice’s JavaScript to incorporate aggregateRating structured data on the client’s PDPs. This structured data enabled Google to understand and display the product reviews in the form of rich results.

## Implementation:

The client’s development team implemented the aggregateRating structured data using Bazaarvoice’s JS integration, ensuring that all PDPs were enhanced with accurate product review markup.

## Results:

Shortly after implementing the aggregateRating structured data, our client’s PDPs began to display review-rich results in Google search, which significantly boosted their SEO performance:

*   **Clicks (Year-over-Year):** Increased by 36%
*   **Click-Through Rate (CTR Year-over-Year):** Increased by 34%

## Conclusion:

This was an effective quick-win for our client, as they already had the product reviews in place but were missing the corresponding aggregateRating structured data that Google needed to show rich results. Implementing this markup led to a significant improvement in their SEO visibility, driving more traffic and clicks to their PDPs.
