# Starting a Google Ads Account: To DIY or Not to DIY?

Google Ads has emerged as one of the top tools for digital marketers due to its extensive reach and precise targeting capabilities. However, if you’re considering opening a Google Ads account, you may feel a little daunted by the process. From defining the most valuable conversions to identifying the right placements for your content, there are a ton of factors to consider.

This often begs the question: should you set up your account for yourself or seek help navigating the ever-evolving complexities of digital advertising? The short answer is that it depends on your budget, knowledge, time, and resources. In this article, we delve into both cases to help you confidently decide.

## The Case for Google Ads DIY

Several considerations may factor into your decision. For some, starting your account independently and managing it yourself makes sense. Here’s why:

### Cost Savings Can Go Toward Additional Ad Spend

One of the main reasons you might opt to manage your Google Ads account is to save on the costs of hiring a professional agency or consultant. Unlike traditional advertising methods that often require a significant upfront investment, Google Ads has created a platform allowing agile ad investments. These can be managed without much existing knowledge of media buying.

Setting up a Google Ads account is free, and you only pay when users click on your ads, so you can allocate all of your budget to ad spend. This is often the most desirable approach for those starting a new business or managing a tight budget.

### There Are Ample Resources Available to Novice Google Ads Marketers

For marketers just getting started with Google Ads, many tools and learning resources are available to guide the process. Google Ads Academy, for example, provides free educational resources, tutorials, and certification programs designed to help marketers get proficient in Google Ads.

A DIY approach to Google Ads allows marketers to gain firsthand experience in keyword research, ad creation, bid management, and performance analysis. Through trial and error, you’ll see what works best for your target audience and refine your advertising strategies accordingly. This will ultimately lead to a deeper understanding of your target audience.

### You Can Retain Control Over Your Campaigns

Opening your own Google Ads account gives you control and insight into your campaigns. You can set up your ad budget, define your target audience, and choose the keywords and formats you want to prioritize. Google Ads’ real-time performance data allows you to monitor campaign effectiveness and adjust as needed for better results.

Ultimately, you have more visibility into the campaign and can, in turn, gain expertise about your customers and business that can enhance performance.

## The Case for Getting Google Ads Help

Bringing on an outside agency can be just as valuable. Below, we explore why.

### You Have Valuable Expertise at Your Disposal

Google Ads is a sophisticated, complex advertising platform with various features, settings, and optimization techniques. Navigating the platform effectively as a novice brings a learning curve and requires learning that not all marketers have time for.

Professional agencies or consultants specializing in Google Ads bring industry knowledge to navigate the intricacies of campaign management and optimization. Outside experts often spend time learning about your business and unique goals so that they can develop a customized strategy tailored to your business objectives.

### You’ll Save Time for Other Strategic Investments

Managing Google Ads campaigns requires a significant time investment and an agile approach. You need to monitor, analyze, and optimize data to continuously improve your strategy and maximize ROI. Most business owners don’t necessarily have the time and resources available to oversee the day-to-day management of campaigns.

Outsourcing Google Ads management allows you to focus your time and energy on strategic business initiatives while entrusting the details to experts who can work independently.

### Experts Eliminate the Risk of Wasted Resources

Poorly optimized campaigns have never been so costly. Wasted ad spend and minimal ROI can significantly detract from your strategic initiatives. Experienced professionals bring the knowledge and skills needed to ensure your advertising budget is spent on the right placements and audience, impacting your goals. They may even have access to tools you wouldn’t otherwise have the money to invest in.

Additionally, agencies must stay abreast of market dynamics for their clients. They can ultimately bring those insights to your account to ensure campaign strategies remain relevant in a rapidly changing environment and maintain a competitive edge.

## Grow Your Business With Confidence

By carefully weighing the pros and cons of your decision based on budget, knowledge, and time constraints, you can align your decision with specific needs and goals, maximizing your advertising ROI and growing your business.
