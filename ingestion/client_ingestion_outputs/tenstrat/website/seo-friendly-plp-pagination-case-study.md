# SEO Friendly PLP Pagination Case Study

#### By TenStrat

## Client:

Ecommerce Website in the Toys Industry

## Situation:

Our client, an ecommerce website in the toys industry, had Product Listing Page (PLP) pagination that relied solely on JavaScript. While this provided a functional user experience, it resulted in a completely inaccessible crawl pathway for search engines.

## Challenge:

The client’s PLP pagination used JavaScript without providing any **href** links that crawlers could follow. This meant search engines were unable to crawl their paginated PLP URLs, limiting the discoverability of Product Detail Pages (PDPs) and restricting internal linking opportunities.

## Solution:

We collaborated with the client’s product and development teams to design an SEO-friendly pagination solution that would maintain the current user experience while ensuring crawl accessibility for search engines.

## Implementation:

The client’s development team implemented the proposed SEO-friendly pagination solution, and we validated the changes in a lower environment before deploying them to the production environment.

## Results:

After the implementation, we observed significant improvements in PDP discoverability and internal linking. Shortly after the release, the client’s overall SEO performance showed notable gains:

*   **Growth in Keywords Ranked on Page #1:** Increased by **6%**

## Conclusion:

Ensuring that search engines can crawl your pagination sequence is crucial for improving PDP discoverability, internal linking, and overall SEO performance for ecommerce websites. By providing a crawlable pagination structure, our client saw significant gains in search visibility and keyword rankings.
