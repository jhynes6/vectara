# A Guide to Google Analytics 4 (GA4)

#### By TenStrat

Reporting on SEO value and its impact on ROI has become increasingly important to the modern marketer. Many now rely on Google Analytics 4 (GA4) to monitor website traffic and measure engagement, gaining visibility into cross-platform activity and pathing analysis. Whether you’re a longtime Google Analytics user getting used to GA4 or just getting started, there is much to learn about Google’s latest features.

In this article, we delve into everything you need to know about GA4 to raise the bar on your SEO reporting and drive greater website performance.

## **What Makes Google Analytics 4 Different From Universal Analytics?**

Several key features of GA4 differ from previous iterations. Understanding these nuances will help you make the most of their web analytics.

### **The Shift From Sessions to Events**

GA4 is built around user events. This is a significant shift from previous iterations, which were focused on user sessions. An events-based model tracks each user interaction as a standalone event, as opposed to grouping user interactions within a given time frame. This unlocks a more complete view of the customer journey with cross-device and cross-platform tracking to reveal every user interaction with your website or app.

### **Machine Learning & Predictive Analytics**

Google has introduced extensive machine learning capabilities in GA4. Predictive metrics like purchase probability, churn probability, and potential revenue offer businesses insight into areas of opportunity and a better understanding of their customers and prospects. Identifying data trends and future outcomes will help marketers fill in the gaps in the user journey to deliver more impactful experiences.

### **Metrics & Reporting**

Since GA4 collects data differently than Universal Analytics, the available metrics and reporting also differ slightly. Below, we outline several key differences:

*   **Sessions:** GA4 encourages users to think about meaningful engagement on the site. For example, “engaged sessions” is a count of sessions where the user does something. It must last longer than 10 seconds, have one or more conversion events, or have two or more page/screen views.
*   **Views/Data Streams:** GA4 no longer has views; instead, it has data streams. This could be a website or an app.
*   **Events:** Where UA lets you give “events” a label, GA4 automatically includes events for several categories, including page view, scroll tracking, outbound click tracking, site search, form interactions, video engagement, and more.
*   **Engagement Rates:** Bounce rate is no longer a standalone metric. The engagement rate shows you the percentage of quality site visits.

Additionally, the reporting tabs have new customization options, allowing you to better tailor reports to their unique needs.

### **Compliance With Data Privacy Regulations**

GA4 moves away from cookie-based tracking, providing greater user data protection and ensuring businesses comply with global regulations. For example, GA4 does not log IP addresses. Additionally, features like Consent Mode allow website and mobile app owners to adjust Google tags based on the user’s consent.

### **Integrations With Google Properties**

GA4 is better integrated with Google Marketing Platform and Google Ads, allowing GA4 data to improve campaign management. This provides insight into the full customer cycle, from how users interact with your ads to how these same ads lead to website or app conversions.

## **Key Google Analytics 4 Analyses**

GA4’s Exploration introduced new data visualization options to help you better understand and digest your data. Below, we outline several key insights available through GA4.

*   **Funnel Analysis:** Visualize what steps shoppers take to complete an event and see what’s working or not.
*   **Path Analysis:** Understand the series of events users trigger along their path, uncovering looping behavior that may indicate where users become stuck.
*   **Segment Overlap:** Group user events or sessions containing conditions, like users who visited a specific page, and see key differences among segments.
*   **Cohort Analysis:** Examine groups of users with a common characteristic to understand what motivates them to take action.
*   **User Lifetime:** Uncover which source drives users with the highest lifetime revenue, including highest purchase probability and lowest churn probability.
