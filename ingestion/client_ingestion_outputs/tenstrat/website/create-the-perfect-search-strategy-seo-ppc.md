# How to Combine SEO & PPC Efforts to Create the Perfect Search Strategy

#### By TenStrat

Does the perfect search strategy exist? Nothing is ever perfect. But you can get pretty close. Search engine rankings are weird; the lower, the better. Achieving top search engine rankings depends on developing a strategy to account for how the search engine will grade a website. Combined methods of search engine optimization (SEO), search engine marketing (SEM), and pay-per-click (PPC) can drive better results than relying on a single search method or no search method at all.

## **What Is Search Engine Optimization (SEO)?**

[Search engine optimization](https://www.oed.com/dictionary/search-engine-optimization_n?tab=factsheet#99288508369), otherwise known as SEO, is the process of increasing website visibility by strategically managing search engine rankings through keyword analysis and other means.

Several key elements have to exist to apply SEO to a successful search strategy.

### **Website Accessibility, Readability, and Functionality Through User Experience (UX)**

Poorly drafted websites hurt SEO strategy. Best practices for website design and functionality include:

*   Keeping up with industry trends in website design.
*   Only utilizing clear and concise imagery and videos.
*   Monitoring website load time speeds.
*   Being direct in website mapping.

### **Linked Content From Internal and External Relevant Sources**

An essential component of SEO rankings is website credibility. The website’s credibility relies on linked content from one website to another and vice versa. Tips to add to linked content are:

*   Make the anchor text for links a keyword.
*   Make use of pillar and cluster pages for website mapping.
*   Increase shared content.

### **Inclusion of Industry Specific Keywords Throughout the Website**

Keywords may be the most important element of SEO. The keywords chosen to add to website copy and content should embrace the industry. Relevant terms should be included as much as possible.

However, it is important to monitor how each keyword ranks. Difficult keywords can have a high domain authority with another site. Using this type of keyword often has little to no effect on increasing your SEO ranking.

### **Content That Responds Well to Search Queries and Keywords**

Most keywords ask questions. Keywords should be industry-specific and answer the question or provide in-depth knowledge of the topic. Incorporating an industry keyword without giving insight into the keyword can negatively impact website credibility and, eventually, SEO rankings overall.

## **What Is Search Engine Marketing (SEM)?**

Search engine marketing (SEM) is a digital marketing strategy that amplifies search rankings for a specific website. SEM strategy includes tactics for both organic rankings and paid.

SEM can add substantial benefits to SEO. SEO encompasses organic traffic, maximizing the ability of a website to compete with others in the industry. Because a function of SEM is paid ads, SEM can add website integrity, which is a crucial influence in SEO rankings, along with increased visibility.

SEM is broad and includes several different strategy methods. One such paid method of SEM is pay-per-click (PPC).

### **What Is Pay-Per-Click (PPC)?**

Pay-per-click (PPC) involves bidding for lower search engine rankings based on specific keywords and ad placements. PPC aims to influence potential patrons to visit the website and engage with online content. A successful click triggers a fee which the advertiser pays for.

## **Combining SEO and PPC for a Better Keyword Strategy**

SEO, SEM, and PCC are each effective individually. Combining the strategy methods ensures that search engine rankings are lower in the future.

Best practices for joining the strategies together include:

*   Finding the SEO keywords with the highest traction to the website and creating a PPC campaign utilizing one or more of the targeted keywords.
*   Building a PPC campaign around a specific keyword and linking the ad to a central page (pillar page) where other relevant content that is similar to the keyword can be found. This strategy helps increase the site’s time and adds the website as an authority on other niche content.
*   Creating A/B PPC ad tests to determine the best headline and/or keywords to implement.
*   Bidding for more difficult keywords with PPC to increase visibility and brand awareness.

Discovering which combined strategy or strategies are right for a business requires an analytic review and understanding of SEO, SEM, and PPC. Websites hold a ton of data and consumer behavior, not to mention other analysis tools like Google Analytics.
