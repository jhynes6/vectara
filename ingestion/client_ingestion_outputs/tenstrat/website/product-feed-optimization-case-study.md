# Product Feed Optimization Case Study

#### By TenStrat

## Client:

Ecommerce Company in the Home Goods Industry

## Situation:

The client, an ecommerce company in the home goods industry, faced several issues with their product feed that impacted their visibility in Search. Key product attribute details were either missing or poorly defined:

*   The “color” attribute for all products was set to “multi” instead of a specific color like “ivory.”
*   The “description” attribute for all products was identical to their “title” attribute.
*   Attributes such as “material”, “pattern”, and “dimensions” were missing entirely.
*   The product feed lacked product variants (e.g., different colors, sizes, materials for a lamp available in nickel, brass, and blackened bronze).

## Challenge:

The main challenge was to ensure that all key product details and variants were accurately imported into Google Merchant Center via supplemental feeds and product feed updates. This required sourcing accurate data points to enhance the product feed and address gaps in information.

## Implementation:

We collaborated closely with the client’s feed management provider and item operations teams to gather the appropriate product data points and updated the product feed accordingly. Where necessary, we used supplemental feeds to complement the available data and ensure a more complete feed.

## Key updates included:

*   **Description Update:** Provided detailed and unique product information.
*   **Material Update:** Added product materials to enhance product attributes and provide better filtering options.
*   **Color Mapping:** Updated color attributes across products to their correct, specific values.
*   **Unit Pricing, Dimensions, and Weight Updates:** Added pricing per unit and dimensions (height, width, length, weight) to make the product listings more comprehensive.
*   **Pattern and Loyalty Program Updates:** Added missing pattern details and loyalty program information.
*   **Product Variants:** Ensured product variants (such as colors and sizes) were properly imported into the feed.

## Results:

The impact of these updates was significant, resulting in notable improvements across both SEO and paid product listings:

*   **SEO revenue:** Increased by **26%**
*   **SEO orders:** Increased by **24%**
*   **SEO BOPIS (Buy Online Pickup In-Store) Orders:** Increased by **23%**
*   **SEO product listing clicks:** Increased by **23%**
*   **SEO product listing impressions:** Increased by **29%**
*   **Paid product listing clicks:** Increased by **24%**
*   **Paid product listing impressions:** Increased by **16%**
*   **Paid product listing click-through rate (CTR):** Increased by **6.4%**

## Conclusion:

Optimizing product feeds with detailed attributes and variants can drive **substantial** performance gains in both **organic and paid product listings**. By ensuring that all key product details were accurately represented, we were able to boost visibility, relevancy, and customer engagement, ultimately driving higher sales and improving the overall shopping experience.
