# Copy Blocks on Product Listing Pages (PLPs) Case Study

#### By John Caiozzo

## Client:

Ecommerce Website in the Toys Industry

## Situation:

The client operated in a highly competitive online market for toys and related products. Their Product Listing Pages (PLPs) were visually appealing and well-organized, but lacked depth in category-specific content. As a result, these pages were not fully optimized for search engines, limiting their ability to rank for a wider range of category-relevant queries.

## Challenge:

Our task was to improve the SEO performance of the PLPs without violating the client’s stringent brand guidelines. Additionally, any new on-page content needed to pass legal review, ensuring that the tone, language, and claims aligned with both brand standards and industry regulations.

## Solution:

We proposed adding strategic, keyword-optimized copy blocks at the bottom of selected PLPs. These copy blocks would provide informative, category-focused content that answered common user questions and highlighted the product assortment in more depth. By doing so, we aimed to boost the page’s semantic richness and relevance to target keywords, thereby improving its cosine similarity scores for search engines. This optimization was intended to help the pages rank for new searches and expand organic reach without compromising brand standards.

## Implementation:

Our team developed a series of concise, authoritative copy blocks that focused on the toys category’s features, benefits, and variety. Each copy block underwent multiple rounds of internal SEO review to ensure keyword alignment. We then collaborated closely with the client’s legal and brand review teams to refine the tone and ensure compliance with their guidelines. Once approved, the site authoring team seamlessly integrated these copy blocks into a set of test PLPs, ensuring they were visually consistent and user-friendly.

## Results:

Shortly after the new content went live, the client experienced significant improvements in key SEO metrics. The test PLPs saw:

*   **Organic Traffic:** +13% increase, indicating enhanced findability and relevance.
*   **Click-Through Rate (CTR):** +17% uplift, reflecting stronger SERP presence and improved user engagement.
*   **Rankings:** Noticeable improvements in rankings for several high-priority search queries, broadening visibility in competitive search landscapes.

## Conclusion:

By adding well-researched, strategically placed copy blocks to the bottom of key PLPs, the client was able to improve page relevance, earn higher search engine rankings, and drive more organic traffic. The careful collaboration with brand and legal teams ensured that the new content aligned with the company’s strict guidelines. Ultimately, this measured content addition served as a sustainable, SEO-driven solution to enhance the client’s online visibility and overall search performance in a competitive ecommerce environment.
