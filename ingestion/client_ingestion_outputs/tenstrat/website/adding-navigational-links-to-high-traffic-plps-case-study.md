# Adding Navigational Links to High-Traffic PLPs Case Study

#### By John Caiozzo

## Client:

Ecommerce Website in the Toys Industry

## Situation:

Our client, a notable ecommerce retailer in the toy category, recognized a significant missed opportunity on many of their parent category pages. Despite attracting a substantial volume of visitors, parent category pages did not include any internal navigational links leading to subcategories. As a result, search engines had limited signals on how product collections were structured, and users lacked direct pathways to discover a broader range of specific toy categories.

## Challenge:

As an example, the absence of navigational links meant the subcategories under the “Kids Toys” umbrella—each representing a popular and distinct segment of the product line—weren’t benefiting from the existing page’s link equity. Users who landed on the main PLP had to rely on site search or multiple clicks to find categories like “Action Figures” or “Dolls.” This navigational gap could lead to missed SEO opportunities and lower user engagement and conversions.

## Solution:

We recommended adding a concise, visually appealing row of navigational links at the top of parent categories. Instead of just showing a broad category (ex. “Kid Toys), parent categories would now offer direct pathways to high-priority subcategories, such as:

*   “Action Figures”
*   “Dolls”
*   “Board Games”
*   “Dress-Up & Role Play”
*   “Vehicles & Playsets”
*   “New Arrivals”

By surfacing these links, both search engines and users would gain a clearer understanding of the site’s internal hierarchy, thereby improving visibility and discoverability of each subcategory.

## Implementation:

Our team partnered with the client’s developers to implement navigational pill links that fit seamlessly into the page’s existing aesthetic. Each link was selected based on internal data and keyword research, ensuring optimal relevance and user interest. Following the launch, we closely monitored changes in organic traffic, CTR, and conversion rates for the linked subcategories.

## Results:

The impact of adding these navigational links was immediate and substantial. The subcategories linked from the main PLP observed:

*   **SEO Clicks:** Increased by +38%, indicating improved visibility and user engagement.
*   **Click-Through Rate (CTR):** Rose by +52.7%, reflecting stronger SERP relevancy and user intent alignment.
*   **Conversions:** Surged by +183%, demonstrating that more intuitive navigation not only drew visitors in but also encouraged them to complete purchases.

## Conclusion:

By integrating navigational links into the high-level category pages, we effectively channeled link equity to critical child categories and enhanced user flow throughout the site. The marked improvements in visibility, engagement, and conversions underscore how even a relatively small structural adjustment can yield substantial gains in SEO performance and overall user satisfaction.
