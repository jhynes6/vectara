# What Should I Look for in a Marketing Agency?

#### By TenStrat

## **Performance Marketing Partnership: Here’s What You Really Need in a Digital Marketing Agency**

A strong digital marketing agency can do all of the work for you so that you can spend more time on important tasks in your business. If you’re beginning to shop around for a powerful marketing agency, then you may want to know where to start. What should you be looking for in a marketing partnership? This guide will help you look through crucial factors and help you make a decision.

## **Define Your Digital Marketing Goals**

Your number one priority is to define your goals. What results do you want to achieve from hiring a digital marketing agency? Once you figure out what matters to you, your choices become easier to navigate. Simply align your purchase choice with your set of goals to set your company on the path to success. Let’s take a look at two types of goals below:

### **Long-Term Goals**

Long-term goals might be easier to create because they can be very broad and have no time limit or specific metrics. These goals can steer your company in a particular direction to reach its full potential or to accommodate certain markets.

**Example long-term goals**: To reach every mobile user with a specific interest, expose your brand to two million people, or reach 100,000 email subscribers.

### **Short-Term Goals**

Short-term goals are easier to measure but more challenging to set up correctly. This is because so many factors influence your desired results, with many of them in subjective arenas. Which short-term goals are best to focus on? This is up to you and is worth the time it takes to decide.

**Example short-term goals**: To obtain 100,000 unique pageviews per month, optimize four digital ads per month to get a 15% CTR, or obtain 100 likes per post on social media.

## **Experience in Your Industry**

Specific industry experience should pique your interest because a specialist can leverage hidden knowledge and utilize niche secrets to your advantage. In the hands of a focused professional, your campaigns can reach even the most secluded corners of the world.

An experienced digital marketing agency can offer substantial benefits by:

*   Using niche-specific jargon.
*   Creating laser-focused ads.
*   Understanding the target audience.
*   Knowing the buyers’ pain points.
*   Easily developing sales funnels and upsells.
*   Delivering unparalleled customer service.

In short, a digital marketing agency specializing in your vertical is worth the investment.

That said, a jack-of-all-trades marketing agency can fit the bill nicely. Certain agencies will offer services to industries across the board because their services can apply to every business. Additionally, the in-house staff will be trained to handle each situation separately and be capable of creating custom packages that make good use of each service they offer.

Such agencies will also have inside knowledge about commercial and industrial trends that can bolster your advertising efforts.

## **Knowledge of the Latest Marketing Trends**

Decades ago, companies spent money on weekly circulars and direct mailers to reach customers. As advertising evolved, businesses began posting on outdoor billboards, LED displays, and special events. These days, digital advertising is the norm on platforms like Google Search Network, social media, and DSPs.

A powerful marketing agency will be able to extract information from the latest trends to find exactly where the target customers are most likely to visit. In addition, they can craft dedicated ads that capture attention and ultimately drive more business your way.

## **Dedicated Account Manager**

A dedicated account manager will be your liaison in the company and is important for efficacy. At any point in time, you can reach out to your account manager to ask questions, for reports, or to pivot when necessary. Should any complications arise, the manager may also notify you and leave the communication channels open for your response.

## **Reporting Activities**

In the marketing world, data makes the world go ’round. However, it’s also quite confusing to traverse. A robust reporting system will crunch numbers, filter out unnecessary information, and compile everything into a presentable package full of colorful visual representations. The marketing agency should do this for you monthly, but certain ones can generate them weekly for a premium.

After a few months of marketing work, you can piece together the reports to get a bird’s eye view of the landscape and see exactly what’s going on with your branding efforts.

## **Marketing Agency Fair Prices**

The gold standard for marketing services is a monthly subscription that includes all the necessary activities your brand needs to bring in consumers. Expect to pay hundreds for a small set of marketing services or upwards of tens of thousands for more comprehensive services. It really depends on your needs and budget, so choose an agency that seems reasonable for the advertising work that you request. When in doubt, shop around at multiple agencies until you find something suitable.

Note: Lower pricing does not mean it’s a better deal. It is typically better to pay the market price for services or a higher amount for a more reputable agency. You will meet your needs while avoiding unnecessary headaches and loss of time.

## **Customization — Tailored Packages**

Although it is a good idea to look through a marketing agency’s core services, it is even better to be able to tailor the packages into campaigns that give you even more value for your investment. A veteran agency often discounts you for ordering in bulk or bundling services together. It is a win-win situation because you can reach every customer possible while they get to do what they do best.

If an agency does not yet have a service available, feel free to suggest it in their feedback form so they can develop something for your specific needs. You will get to work closely with them to create something worthwhile that other clients may wish to use, too.
