# What is the Google Core Update and How Does It Impact Your Business?

Google is the biggest search engine in the world. According to search engine management platform [Semrush](https://www.semrush.com/blog/google-search-statistics/), in 2023 alone, 5.9 million Google searches happened every minute, and Google comprises almost 92% of the total global search engine market. With so many websites to comb through, Google has a massive responsibility to ensure that its search results are reliable and credible through its Search algorithm. As such, every year, Google rolls out [core updates to its search systems](https://developers.google.com/search/updates/core-updates) to ensure its results remain accurate and relevant to its users. Let’s dive into what Google core updates are and what they mean for your business.

## **How Does Google’s Search Algorithm Work?**

When you consider how many websites exist on the Internet, it’s not feasible for Google’s employees to analyze each website and manually rank search results. Instead, Google uses a [Search algorithm](https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/how-search-works/ranking-results/) that automatically combs through website content and then displays search results in their order of usefulness. Its Search algorithm looks at a variety of factors when selecting which results to show, but the five most important factors are:

*   **Meaning:** The intent behind a user’s query based on language models (i.e., understanding that changing a tire is different than changing the thermostat temperature)
*   **Relevance:** The relevance of a web page to what the user is looking for based on the type of site (such as a government site or an online store) and the site’s keywords
*   **Quality:** The trustworthiness or credibility of a site
*   **Usability:** How quickly a site loads and whether it’s mobile-friendly
*   **Context:** A user’s search history, location, and other contextual information affect search intent. For example, someone in the United States searching for “football” may see the Super Bowl ranked higher in search results than the FIFA World Cup due to localization.

This is where search engine optimization (SEO) comes in. By using best practices based on Google’s Search algorithm, organizations can improve their site traffic, credibility, and overall business goals through enhancements to their web pages. Unsurprisingly, many SEO managers rely on [Google Analytics](https://analytics.withgoogle.com/) to accurately assess current standings and areas for advancement.

## **What is the Google Core Update to Its Algorithm?**

Because of the massive volume of websites created daily, Google consistently updates its search algorithms and systems, or “core updates.” As stated on its [core updates site](https://developers.google.com/search/updates/core-updates), this helps ensure that search results remain credible and reliable and evolve as new sites improve their SEO. These changes reflect the constant evolution of technology, how people interact with it, and their online behaviors. Its [most recent core update](https://status.search.google.com/incidents/WtY1CQgfqrr2cjxKbyUk) occurred in November 2023. Typically, these updates take a couple of weeks to roll out from when they’re announced to when they’re complete.

## **How Often Does Google Update Their Core Search?**

Google doesn’t have a set schedule when making core updates, but as the biggest search engine in the world, we can assume that it will make updates multiple times throughout the year. Last year, for example, there were [four significant updates to the core](https://status.search.google.com/products/rGHU1u87FJnkP6W2GwMi/history), while in 2022, there were only two. On [Google’s Core Updates](https://developers.google.com/search/updates/core-updates) page, it simply states that “several times a year, Google makes significant, broad changes.” However, the company shared that it’s also continuously making more minor updates that it doesn’t announce due to their low impact.

## **How Will the Core Update Affect Your Site?**

Google has stated that the [core update](https://developers.google.com/search/updates/core-updates) is focused on “improving” how its systems analyze content. These changes may negatively affect pages that perform well while improving the rankings of “under-rewarded” pages. Conversely, if your site suddenly has a higher ranking than previously, the new update has deemed your page more deserving of a higher ranking than others.

If yours is one of the sites that’s negatively impacted, you still have the opportunity to restore your ranking. Because Google is constantly making changes, including minor updates that may not receive widespread announcements, a site can recover if the next update improves. However, Google cautions that just because those improvements are made, this is not a guarantee of recovering any loss in rankings. It’s all about the quality of your SEO and content.

## **What Can Your Business Do With the Core Update?**

The SEO practice is constantly evolving, and just because your business has performed well doesn’t mean it will continue to do so. Your ranking can change whether there’s more competition in your industry or you haven’t updated your website’s content in a while. At the same time, this means there’s hope for sites that underperform to increase their traffic and visibility. Keeping the five factors that Google bases its Search algorithm on, you can set up a game plan for how your site’s content can improve and beat your competition.
