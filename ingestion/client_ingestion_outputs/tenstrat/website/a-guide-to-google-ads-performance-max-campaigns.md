# A Guide to Google Ads Performance Max Campaigns

Brands embrace omnichannel marketing for two main reasons: to meet customers wherever they are in the digital landscape and to drive valuable outcomes for their business. According to Google, omnichannel strategies drive [an 80% higher rate of incremental store visits](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/consumer-trends/meeting-shoppers-needs-omnichannel-drives-instore/). This finding consequently accelerated the need for agile campaign management, including performance monitoring and in-flight optimizations. This is no easy feat for today’s time-constrained marketers. Whether you’re a seasoned Google Ads manager or just getting started, Google Ads’ Performance Max (PMax) has emerged as a valuable tool for digital marketers. PMax is a new goal-based campaign type that allows performance advertisers to access all of Google Ads inventory for a single campaign. PMax optimizes performance in real-time using Smart Bidding, powered by AI, to deliver more conversions for your business. Here, we outline everything you need to know to start with PMax.
