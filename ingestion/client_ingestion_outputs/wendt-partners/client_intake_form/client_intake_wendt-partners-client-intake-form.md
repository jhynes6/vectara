Target Clientele
 2 scenarios: growth vs. hubspot
 Hubspot: B2B exclusive, 3 segments within that market (tech, indust, prof serv) Cultural reluctance in prof services. Industrial (coming from nothing, no use, big learning curve) ERP integration. Teech (don’t focus on start ups and saas. Enterprise software msps, business applications, etc. hardware)
 Hubspot (focus on reaching out to MM) Usually 1-2 people involved. Budget only for software, not much other spend. Very young, no power. Can still sell them something.
 Would rather sell $5k hubspot software to 2 diff customers. Looking to have add on services.
 CRM driven use case, focusing on sales, increasingly focus on services. Middle market and up.
 COO, CTO, VP level (critical decision makers)
 ERP integration. Could tie it to revenue generation. Can run a test for that transition.
 Strong play in the salesforce replacement category.
 Evie (SDR) great experience
 Market differentiators
 Experience level of team (7-12 years), full service (4 lines of business cover all) (hubspot solutions, tech solutions, digital solutions team, growth solutions team).
 Came from ERP software, understand electronic content management. Not just here to make mechanics make sense.
 Are they competent, understand industry, are we going to forget business objective?)
 Risk based sale. (don’t want to take the risk)
 (will be sending more information to us with case studies)
 Conversation based selling
 Phase 2 goes to evie and pat
 Phase 1 going to doug (how will we staff the process?)
 Most leads working on salesforce, major competitor, warm leads, inquired about hubspot, cold leads not interested.
 #1 pain with salesforce: complicated to use, test at least one sentence of education
 Losing deals being mr. nice guy
 10,000 layoffs (salesforce)
 Growing organically vs. acquisition
 slack

Who do you sell to? Who is your target customer? (ex. Location (what country/countries will you work with), demographics, interests, goals... the more information the better) Can you market products for 21+? (alcohol, CBD, Cannabis, etc.)

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words?

What CRM do you currently use?

What is your main goal of working with us? (Expand to a new sales vertical, scale existing product revenue, others)

If MintLeads and you are opening a bottle of champagne a year from now, what would we be celebrating?
