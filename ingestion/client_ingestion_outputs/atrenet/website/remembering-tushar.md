# Remembering Tushar Atre

We are saddened and shocked by the untimely passing of our friend, founder, and CEO, Tushar Atre.

Tushar was clever, creative, and hardworking in every area of his life, both professionally and personally. He was an avid surfer, mountain biker, guitarist, and craftsman. Tushar appreciated art and expression, supporting local artists and integrating their work into his style. He loved his family and friends, and found joy and passion in every facet of life. Most importantly, Tushar pushed others to think and act differently – to do better, and to always strive for more.

Tushar founded AtreNet in 1996 with a single client, Mercury Interactive. Over 23 years, he guided the company to become the premiere web services agency for B2B technology companies. His dedicated team delivered hundreds of successful and influential projects, setting the benchmark for web design, optimization, and user experience. He loved working with his customers and forging relationships with them. Many of those customers became close friends.

Tushar’s focus never wavered from AtreNet’s guiding mission: delivering more impact and success for our valued customers. He spearheaded the creation of innovative service programs including Rapid Relaunch and Agile Evolution. Recently, he was proud to lead the development of AtreNet’s EPIC scoring system, a one-of-a-kind method for benchmarking corporate web sites.

Tushar was an indispensable presence, both at AtreNet and in the industry at large. He will be missed, and we extend our deepest condolences to his friends, family, and loved ones.

As a postscript to the message above, on behalf of the AtreNet team, I wanted to express our deep appreciation to the clients and friends who have reached out to express their sympathies. Like many members of the team, I worked closely with Tushar for many years. In fact, I joined AtreNet in 1996. Tushar guided us successfully through a dot-com bubble, many challenging technological shifts, and a global recession. Through it all, he kept us focused on customer satisfaction, innovation, and deliberate, measured growth. In that spirit, and with the blessing and support of Tushar’s network of friends and family, we are committed and proud to carry his vision forward.
