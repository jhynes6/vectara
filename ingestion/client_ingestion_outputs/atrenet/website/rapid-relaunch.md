# ATRENET RAPID RELAUNCH

AtreNet’s Rapid Relaunch program is a proven approach for revitalizing your website in only 12 weeks. We’ve refined this customer-centric methodology over 24+ years of mission-critical projects for B2B technology companies.

_Here’s what our 12 weeks together looks like._

## WEEK 1

### KICK-OFF MEETING

#### HOW WE GOT HERE

You give us the scoop: Your backstory, goals, requirements, brand vision, audience, and competitive space.

### WHERE WE GO FROM HERE

We detail the plan: process, timeline, major milestones, and next steps. Let’s go!

## WEEK 2-3

### INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE:  BUILDING A FOUNDATION

This phase is all about rapid prototyping. We work with you to architect your new site through visual site maps and high fidelity wire frames.

Wire frames are a **crucial bridge** between strategy and design.

## WEEK 4

### IT’S TIME FOR DESIGN CONCEPTS!

We present multiple homepage concepts. You pick a winner.

## WEEKS 5-8

### COMPLETE DESIGN SET

We create a gorgeous set of purpose-built designs for key pages, components, and user experiences.

_It’s your entire site. Visualized._

## WEEKS 8-11

### BRINGING IT TO LIFE

Our development team transforms the approved strategy and designs into a world-class website.

**Implement / Test / Review / Approve**

Our weapon of choice? The **EPIC CMS**. A WordPress-powered platform developed specifically for the needs of our clients.

EPIC is performant, easy-to-use, and flexible.

## WEEK 12

### LAUNCH

The time is here. We’ll work closely with your team to ensure a smooth, stress-free roll out.
