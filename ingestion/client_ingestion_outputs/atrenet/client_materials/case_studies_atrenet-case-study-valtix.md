CUSTOMER SUCCESS CASE STUDY WITH VALTIX

“From the design process, the speed of delivery, and the model
of ongoing maintenance, Atrenet was a perfect fit for our fast
moving cybersecurity company.”

Erik Kristiansen
Vice President of Marketing at Valtix

What does Valtix do? What category are you defining?

Valtix delivers multicloud security to protect workloads
and data in the public cloud. We uniquely address this
challenge through a cloud network security platform
delivered as a service. We’re defining the nascent
‘secure cloud networking’ category and compete with
some of the largest companies in the world (including
the cloud providers), alternative approaches to
protecting workloads (EDR), and other startups.

What is your role at Valtix?

As VP of Marketing I lead marketing for Valtix including
communications, brand, content, growth marketing,
product marketing, and our SDR team.

What were the goals of the new website?

There were three big goals: (1) Tell the brand story
(why, what, how) in a impactful way that also drives the
category message and positions us as an innovator in
the space (2) Provide a platform for self-discovery and
research as buyers do their research outside of the sales
process (3) Impact demand generation and capture with
SEO that drives users through the buyer’s journey.

Did AtreNet achieve or exceed these expectations? If yes,
how did AtreNet specifically help you improve your web
presence?

Atrenet does a stellar job of creating websites that
make early and mid stage companies look and play
bigger. From the design process, the speed of delivery,
and the model of ongoing maintenance, Atrenet was a
perfect fit for our fast moving cybersecurity company.

Our design was incredibly differentiated and imparted
our key multicloud value proposition nicely. After the
initial website was released, we had a solid foundation,
but you’re not done. Atrenet does an excellent job of
ongoing support as your needs evolve and change.
They helped us to evolve our SEO strategy, add new
solutions pages, and demand generation tools including
a competitive pricing calculator.  At every stage, Atrenet
moves quickly and is very responsive.

How did you hear about AtreNet?

I previously worked with Atrenet at a different
company. I’d certainly look to use Atrenet again.

What do you think is AtreNet’s advantage or best skillset/
experience over other web agencies?

Atrenet has a great feel for how to make tech
companies standout within a crowded market.
They are excellent at using design to emphasize
messaging. Atrenet’s support model works very well for
organizations who don’t have the in house expertise.
The website is never done and Atrenet is there at every
stage.

Would you recommend AtreNet to other B2B technology
companies?

Yes, 100%. Through our website we’ve driven 80% of
our pipeline and in one year grew ARR 6X. Atrenet was
a critical part of our success.
