PRESENTATION: YOUR BRAND
VISION MADE REAL

For more than two decades, AtreNet has worked with our B2B technology clients to design and

develop websites that function as a pure expression of their brand vision. For emerging

companies, the initial visual identity is often a product of the website relaunch. For established

companies, we are experienced with working with third-party brand agencies and brand

guidelines to effectively translate those standards to the specific needs of the web environment.

Our web strategists, designers, and technical experts work in close collaboration to ensure that

every page embodies your brand promise and fulfills the potential of your website as your most

important messaging and engagement platform.

From vision....

... to reality.

A BEST-OF-BREED PLATFORM
FOR PERFORMANCE AND SECURITY

For hosting, we recommed Pantheon.io

for their security, performance, backup

capabilities, and workflow features.

We can also work effectively within WP

Engine or the WordPress hosting

environment of your choice.

The WordPress instance will contain

only the marketing site, including

resources, blog and any related

content. WordPress provides industry-

leading ease-of-use and content

management tools. On top of the core

CMS functionality, AtreNet will install

and configure a host of security and

publishing enhancements as part of

our EPIC Builder platform.

To simplify security requirements,

alleviate GDPR obligations, and reduce

internal maintenance efforts, AtreNet

recommends utilizing specialized

services to store and manage customer

data. Contact forms (such as demo,

gated assets and sales inquiries) will be

managed through a marketing solution

such as HubSpot or Marketo, tightly

integrated with the marketing site.

A PASSION FOR PERFORMANCE

Google looks at your site with a

clear and inescapable point-of-

view: a slow-loading site equals a

poor user experience. If your site

is not up-to-speed, your search

engine ranking suffers.

And it's not just how high you'll

place on a Google search. Studies

show that faster sites deliver

average session lengths that are

70% longer and bounce rates that

are 35% lower. For mobile users,

performance is even more

critical: 53% of mobile users

abandon sites that take longer

than 3 seconds to load.

That's why, throughout the

development process, AtreNet is

rigorously optimizing and testing

for performance.

AtreNet implements a battery of
techniques and technologies to ensure
your website is a sleek, high-performing
machine.

Optimized code for streamlined delivery

Vigorous image production methodologies to
ensure a balance of quality and size

Exhaustive compression workflows for all assets

Reduction in page size through aggregation

Dynamic display of rich content dependent on
connection speed

Error checking to ensure the browser is never
left waiting

Reduction of round trips through intelligent
caching

Management of redirects to avoid multiple
browser calls

Overall balance of scripts, images, CSS, HTML
and media to ensure efficient page delivery

MAKING SECURITY TOP OF MIND

As we develop and launch your new site, we'll implement

best-practice security measures, including:

• Security headers

• Database and code backups

• Two-factor authentication

• Forcing SSL

• Brute force protection

• Obfuscating admin login

• Strong password enforcement

• Security logs and digest emails

• File change detection

• Malware scanning

• 404 detection

•

IP blacklisting

• Plugin vulnerability monitoring.

PRODUCTION AND QA:
WHERE THE RUBBER
HITS THE ROAD

AtreNet's comprehensive methodology ensures that we'll hit the pavement at speed once the

site is ready for production. With finalized designs and the EPIC Builder infrastructure in

place, our team will begin the work of transitioning your existing, edited and new content

into the updated site. As with all phases of the project, we reinforce a collaborative process

across teams and provide you with full visibility and regular reporting.

We also test early and test often. We employ a battery of testing procedures to ensure

consistency, performance, accessibility, proper functionality, link integrity, and fit-and-finish.

Under an aggressive timeline, you can count on AtreNet to
deliver a proven process of rapid development without
sacrificing quality.

PUTTING THE
PIECES IN
PLACE:
PROJECT
MANAGEMENT

Talent and technology will only get you so far.

The guiding hand of a senior project manager

is necessary to maintain momentum, manage

communication, and generally keep your

relaunch on the rails. AtreNet's proven Rapid

Relaunch methodology, overseen by one of our

senior project managers, ensures a worry-free

launch that happens on time and with the

quality you'd expect.

Our senior team leaders will also participate in

regular meetings to ensure that creative and

functional requirements do not get lost in

translation. Plus, you'll receive regular

reporting and multiple meetings each week for

status checks and deliverable reviews. You'll

have constant visibility into the current state of

your relaunch, dependencies, blockers, and

pending deliverables.

At AtreNet, proactive project
management is never an
afterthought.

ABOUT ATRENET

In May 1996, our founder Tushar Atre drove

from New York City to Silicon Valley to make

a meeting with Mercury Interactive. Since

then, we’ve worked with thousands of

corporate marketers for B2B technology

com, delivering hundreds of successful and

influential projects.

Tushar pushed others to think and act

differently – to do better, and to always

strive for more. His focus never wavered

from AtreNet’s touchstone: delivering more

impact and success for our valued

customers.

After Tushar's untimely death in 2019, the

AtreNet team stayed committed to serving

our customers and honoring his legacy.

YOUR TEAM

AtreNet's core leadership team will help guide this project to a successful result.

They include:

Brent Brookler, CEO and Account Executive

David Butcher, Client Services Director

Shawn Click, VP Creative and Project Lead

Adam Schlabach, Lead Engineer

THE DROP IN
COALITION

After the tragic passing of our friend and

founder, Tushar Atre, we created the Drop In

Coalition to honor his legacy.

The Drop In Coalition empowers marginalized

and disadvantaged youth by teaching self-

reliance and healing through surfing. The

Drop in Coalition will offer STEAM and STOKE

field trips starting in September 2020.

Through math, science, gardening, and even

Maker Faire activities, the Drop In Coalition

creates a combined problem-solving and

positive flow state while also exposing young

people to STEAM activities, including robotics

and light wave inventions. Then of course, we

go surfing, followed by another problem-

solving session to illustrate how mindful

activities like surfing help spur creativity and

focus.

A portion of AtreNet’s earnings funded the

creation of this non-profit, and AtreNet will

continue to earmark funds to build further

Drop In Coalition programs and initiatives in

the future.
