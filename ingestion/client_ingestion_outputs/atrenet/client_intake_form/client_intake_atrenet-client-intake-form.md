Cost of Services

What is your average order value? What are your “Starting At” costs for your services?
 Rapid Relaunch pricing depends on size of site, but $50k is at the low end up to $135k or more. Average order would be $80k (about).
 Smart Maintenance also depends on scope and size, but $2k on the low end to $40k on the high end, average would be about $10kFrom client 4/23/24: Our hourly rate is $170/hour. To make an estimate on the cost to relaunch your website, if that’s what you would require, we would need to complete some due diligence on your existing site, your requirements for new site and perhaps sites that inspire you.
