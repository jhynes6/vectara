## The X Way Story

#### DRIVE TRANSFORMATIONAL  
REVENUE GROWTH

X Agency was founded by Darwin Liu in 2017 after he spent over a decade cracking the digital marketing code. Darwin developed the X Way when he saw a clear need in the ever-evolving digital marketing landscape to zig when others zagged in order to truly focus on clients' bottom line and overall business objectives.

At the heart of the X Way is an understanding that building a team with deep digital marketing expertise combined with a highly personalized understanding and communication with clients is the key to developing a trusted advisor relationship and ensure the delivery of exceptional results across all KPIs.
