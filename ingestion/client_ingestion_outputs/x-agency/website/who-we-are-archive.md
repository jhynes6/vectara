# THE X WAY STORY

X Agency was founded by Darwin Liu in 2017 after he spent over a decade cracking the digital marketing code. Darwin developed the X Way when he saw a clear need in the ever-evolving digital marketing landscape to zig when others zagged in order to truly focus on clients' bottom line and overall business objectives.  

At the heart of the X Way is an understanding that building a team with deep digital marketing expertise combined with a highly personalized understanding and communication with clients is the key to developing a trusted advisor relationship and ensure the delivery of exceptional results across all KPIs.

# Promoting Economic Diversity and Social Equality

As a proud member of GNEMSDC, X Agency is uniquely positioned to serve as both a tier 1 and tier 2 supplier for many of our larger clients.
