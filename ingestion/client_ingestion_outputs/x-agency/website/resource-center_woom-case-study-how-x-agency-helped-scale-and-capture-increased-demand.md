# Woom Case Study: How X Agency Helped Scale and Capture Increased Demand

## **Overview**

Woom, a leading brand in children's bicycles, faced a pivotal moment in their growth journey. After overcoming an inventory shortage, they needed to quickly scale their marketing efforts to meet increasing demand and grow their market share in the U.S. X Agency partnered with Woom to create a strategic and scalable marketing plan that delivered remarkable results.

## **Mission**

Woom’s mission was to capture increased demand, scale their accounts, and grow topline revenue while ensuring efficient marketing spend. They sought to expand their market share and strengthen their position as a key player in the children’s bicycle industry.

## **Challenge**

Following an inventory shortage, Woom’s marketing efforts had been focused on lean retention and list-building strategies. However, with inventory replenished, they needed to quickly pivot to a full-funnel scalable marketing program. The main challenges included:

*   Scaling topline revenue rapidly while balancing ROAS.
*   Navigating a lengthy purchase cycle (10+ days), which delayed campaign performance insights.
*   Managing the complexities of high AOV products with varying margins across their product lines.

## **XA Solution**

X Agency worked closely with Woom’s team to create a robust, data-driven marketing strategy. By establishing clear short- and long-term goals, XA focused on granular targeting and campaign segmentation to achieve scalable and efficient growth. Key actions included:

### **Granular Targeting and Campaign Segmentation**

*   Segmented campaigns by bike models and product categories, enabling more precise control over scale and CPCs.
*   Established goals across all paid marketing channels, balancing short term inefficiencies with long term growth.
*   Layered audience targeting at the most granular level to maximize relevance and minimize wasted spend.

### **Collaborative Strategy and Continuous Feedback**

*   Held ongoing discussions with Woom’s global product and marketing teams to align on goals and refine strategies.
*   Incorporated real-time feedback on sales pacing, customer insights, and seasonality into campaign adjustments.

### **Key Growth Objectives**

1.  Reviewed top-converting products and planned for upcoming launches.
2.  Developed paid campaigns across Google, Bing, and Meta to balance topline revenue and ROAS.
3.  Created separate goals for key areas:
    *   Bikes
    *   Accessories
    *   Brand
    *   Non-brand and broad expansion
    *   Bundles and seasonal products
4.  Optimized product titles with concise, descriptive details (e.g., bike color and tire size) to stand out in search results.
5.  Added audience exclusions for clean targeting at each stage of the purchase funnel.
6.  Scaled successful campaigns while pulling back ineffective ones, focusing on higher-margin products like bikes over apparel.

*   **Conversions:** Grew by 159%.
