# Isle Case Study: X Agency Drives Remarkable Growth

### **Overview**

ISLE, a leading provider of premium stand up paddleboards, partnered with X Agency to navigate a challenging but promising market environment. By implementing strategic digital marketing tactics, X Agency drove an additional 235% in conversions and a 162% increase in revenue from Google Shopping, all while improving ISLE's profit margins by 70%. Overall revenue from marketing efforts grew by an impressive 99% year-over-year (YoY).

### **Mission**

ISLE wanted to maximize its sales potential during its busiest months of the year while maintaining a strong marketing presence. The goal was to stay ahead of competitors, remain top-of-mind for eager buyers, and capture additional market share—all while overcoming challenges posed by limited inventory.

### **Challenge**

**Increased Demand and Targeted Marketing Led to High Inventory Turnover**  
ISLE’s successful marketing campaigns improved conversion rates and doubled sales, which was fantastic news. However, this success came with a major challenge: managing inventory levels during their peak season. Heading into their busiest months, inventory was running low. To stay competitive and continue driving sales, ISLE needed a marketing strategy that balanced supply and demand while maintaining efficiency.

### **XA Solution**

**Feed Management & Product Communication**  
X Agency worked closely with ISLE to address inventory challenges head-on. This collaboration centered around constant communication and precise inventory management, ensuring marketing dollars were spent wisely. Here’s how the team tackled the challenge:

*   **Pre-Order Strategy:** To keep sales flowing during low-inventory periods, ISLE began offering pre-orders. This allowed ads to continue driving demand and sales, even when products weren’t immediately available.
*   **Daily Inventory Monitoring:** ISLE’s team tracked inventory levels daily, providing updates to X Agency. This ensured marketing efforts aligned with stock availability.
*   **Proactive Communication:** Weekly check-ins between ISLE and X Agency kept both teams informed. By pinpointing best-selling board types and relaying this information to ISLE’s product team, the strategy remained agile and effective.
*   **Scalable Marketing Plans:** X Agency developed projections based on inventory counts provided 2-3 months in advance. This allowed for precise scaling of campaigns depending on stock availability.

Through strategic collaboration and a clear pulse on inventory levels, X Agency ensured that ISLE maintained a strong marketing presence and prevented competitors from gaining ground during peak seasonal months.

*   **Increased Market Share:** Impression share grew from 35% to over 50%, solidifying ISLE’s position as a market leader.
*   **Boosted Traffic:** Click traffic increased by 50%, driving more potential customers to ISLE’s site.
*   **Sustained Growth:** Overall revenue from marketing efforts grew by 99% YoY.
