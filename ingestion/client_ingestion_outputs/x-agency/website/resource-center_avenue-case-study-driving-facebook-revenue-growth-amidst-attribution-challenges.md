# Avenue Case Study: Driving Facebook Revenue Growth Amidst Attribution Challenges

### **Overview**

X Agency partnered with Avenue to overcome significant challenges in their Facebook advertising strategy following changes brought about by Apple’s iOS14.5 update. Despite these hurdles, X Agency’s strategic solutions resulted in impressive results, including 327.20% year-over-year (YoY) revenue growth and 1,503 leads generated.

### **Mission**

The mission was clear: help Avenue navigate the new landscape of Facebook’s advertising attribution challenges while driving meaningful growth in revenue and lead generation. X Agency aimed to rebuild an effective advertising strategy that could thrive under these new conditions.

### **Challenge**

#### **Tackling Facebook’s Attribution Issues**

After Apple’s iOS14.5 update, Facebook’s ability to track and attribute user behavior became much more limited. Avenue struggled to retarget customers effectively, which impacted their ability to generate revenue and maintain marketing momentum. X Agency faced the challenge of adapting to these limitations while keeping Avenue’s Facebook advertising efforts profitable.

### **XA Solution**

#### **Improved Targeting**

To address Avenue’s challenges, X Agency implemented the following strategies:

*   **Broadening Prospecting Campaigns**: X Agency restructured Avenue’s Facebook campaigns to target a broader audience of women aged 40 to 60. By casting a wider net, they reached potential customers who had not previously engaged with Avenue’s brand.
*   **Updated Customer Lists**: Using updated customer data, X Agency prioritized high-spending customers and created lookalike audiences. These audiences shared key characteristics with Avenue’s most valuable customers, making them more likely to convert.
*   **Lead Generation Campaign**: X Agency launched a multi-channel lead generation campaign to retarget Avenue’s audience through email and text. This approach ensured they reached customers who were harder to track on Facebook due to attribution issues.

### **Results**

X Agency’s solutions delivered exceptional results. During the Memorial Day weekend in 2023, the campaign achieved the following outcomes:

*   **1,503 Leads Generated**: Showcasing the effectiveness of the multi-channel approach.
*   **$2.01 Cost per Lead**: Demonstrating careful budget management and optimization.
*   **327.20% YoY Revenue Growth**: Compared to the same period the previous year, underscoring the impact of X Agency’s strategy.
