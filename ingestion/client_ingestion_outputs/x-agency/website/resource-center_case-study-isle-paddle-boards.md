## Problem Statement

ISLE Paddle Boards faced a significant challenge in managing increased demand and inventory levels while aiming to maximize profitability. The company's conversion rates improved, and sales doubled, but inventory levels were low as they approached their busiest months. This required strategic marketing efforts to stay ahead of competitors and remain top-of-mind for eager buyers.

## Strategic Approach

**1. Pre-Order Strategy:**

* ISLE adopted a pre-order sales strategy to manage inventory shortages effectively. This approach allowed the company to continue marketing efforts and drive sales even when inventory was low. By selling boards on a pre-order basis, ISLE ensured that marketing campaigns could proceed without interruption.

**2. Inventory and Demand Monitoring:**

* The ISLE team, in collaboration with X Agency, implemented a system for daily inventory monitoring and regular communication. This enabled them to maintain a balance between inventory levels and marketing expenditures. Weekly communications ensured that both parties had a clear understanding of inventory status and demand forecasts.

**3. Data-Driven Marketing:**

* ISLE and X Agency focused on identifying the best-selling board types and relaying this information to the product team. This data-driven approach allowed for more targeted marketing efforts and informed decision-making regarding inventory replenishment.

## Results

* **Increased Market Presence:**
    * ISLE maintained a strong marketing presence during peak months, preventing competitors from capturing market share. The strategic use of pre-orders and continuous marketing allowed ISLE to leverage increased demand effectively.
    
* **Traffic and Market Share Growth:**
    * X Agency's efforts resulted in a 50% increase in click traffic and a significant rise in market share, moving from a 35% impression share to over 50%. This growth underscored the effectiveness of their collaborative strategy.

## Conclusion

ISLE Paddle Boards successfully navigated the challenges of increased demand and low inventory by implementing a pre-order strategy and maintaining robust communication with X Agency. This approach not only maximized profitability but also strengthened ISLE's market position during critical sales periods.
