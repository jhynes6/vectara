# Huang Acrylic Case Study: Driving Growth with X Agency

## **Overview**

Huang Acrylic, a trusted brand in custom acrylic products, partnered with X Agency to address account inefficiencies and improve both paid advertising and organic performance. Through strategic optimization and data-driven solutions, X Agency helped Huang Acrylic significantly boost revenue and profitability in just one year.

## **Mission**

The primary goal of the partnership was to capture increased demand for Huang Acrylic’s products while improving account profitability. By implementing targeted strategies, X Agency aimed to grow both paid and organic revenue streams.

## **Challenge**

Huang Acrylic faced several challenges:

*   **Lack of Account Optimizations**: The paid campaign structure was poorly organized, with campaigns broken out by ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number) using automatic targeting and minimal adjustments after launch. While these campaigns generated revenue, the return on ad spend (ROAS) was not profitable.
*   **Inadequate Organic ASIN Content**: Key product listings were missing crucial details such as optimized titles, descriptions, and specifications. This lack of information negatively affected both paid advertising and organic search performance.

## **X Agency Solution**

X Agency implemented a two-pronged approach to address these issues:

### **Campaign Breakout Testing and ASIN Updates**

**Paid Efforts:**

1.  **Product Analysis:** Identified top revenue-driving products to prioritize.
2.  **Campaign Launch:** Created three Sponsored Products campaigns for each ASIN+variation using the following targeting methods:
    *   Automatic targeting
    *   Keyword targeting
    *   Product targeting
3.  **Gradual Rollout:** Launched 5-6 ASIN+variations every two weeks to carefully analyze results and control spending.
4.  **Optimization:** Continuously monitored performance and adjusted bids weekly to achieve the lowest cost-per-click (CPC).
5.  **Targeting Adjustments:** Used data from automatic campaigns to identify high-performing keywords and products, then added these to targeted campaigns for greater control and efficiency.
6.  **Category Grouping:** For low-performing ASINs, grouped them into category campaigns to let Amazon’s algorithm optimize product presentation in auctions, conserving budget and maintaining ROAS.
7.  **Scaling:** Once a positive ROAS was achieved, ad spend was scaled to maximize profitability.

**Organic Efforts:**

1.  **ASIN Updates:** Optimized 10 ASIN listings bi-weekly, starting with top revenue performers with low page visits.
2.  **Keyword Integration:** Incorporated high-performing keywords from paid campaigns and competitor research into titles, descriptions, and specifications.
3.  **Enhanced Content:** Added A+ content, high-quality photos, and detailed specifications to improve listing appeal.
4.  **Variations and Bundles:** Created ASIN variations (e.g., size, color, style) and bundled products to increase average order value (AOV).
5.  **Coupon Testing:** Implemented coupons during high-traffic shopping seasons to drive conversions.
6.  **Organic Feed Updates:** Posted weekly to the Organic Feed to increase brand awareness and clicks.

## **Results**

X Agency’s efforts delivered impressive results:

*   **Paid Revenue Growth:** Annual advertising revenue increased by 29%, from $135.8k in 2022 to $192k in 2023. Despite higher ad spend, account profitability improved from a 2x to a 3.5x margin.
*   **Organic Revenue Growth:** Enhancements to ASIN content led to a 15% increase in organic revenue, growing from $277.6k in 2022 to $326.6k in 2023.
*   **Optimized Campaigns:** Targeted strategies reduced wasted spend while driving meaningful traffic and conversions.
