THE CHALLENGE.
Need to scale quickly following an inventory shortage.

Paid Search. Paid Social. Feed Optimization.

The performance marketing strategy had been focused on lean retention +
list-building efforts and the team had to quickly pivot and scale to a
full-funnel scalable marketing program focused on driving top line growth
while not sacriﬁcing proﬁtability.

THE SOLUTION.

XA developed a scalable campaign plan by segmenting campaigns by
speciﬁc bike models and product categories, while also implementing
granular audience targeting.

The team broke out paid campaigns across Google, Bing, and Meta based
on bike model and parent demographics to have better control over scale
and cost per click (CPC), with separate goals for each campaign to balance
revenue growth and return on ad spend (ROAS).

Product titles were optimized to be descriptive yet concise, aligning with
key consumer searches such as bike color and tire size. Audience exclu-
sions were also added to target speciﬁc stages of the purchase funnel.

Revenue and ROAS were balanced by scaling successful strategies and
reducing investment in areas with lower proﬁtability, considering the differ-
ent margins of various product types.

Paid Search. Paid Social.
Localized Campaign Strategy.

THE SOLUTION.

Tasked with increasing event registrations and donations,
XA developed a channel speciﬁc strategy, incorporating a
nationwide focus on Google search based on broad
demand, and a localized campaign structure on Meta to
target speciﬁc metro areas to increase awareness and
consideration to key markets.

XA tested tactics and budgets across key event locations,
utilizing location radius targeting, impactful dynamic ad
creative, and sales-optimized campaign goals. After initial
testing periods, XA made recommendations for both media
mix optimization, budget allocation, and geotargeting
based on best results.

The addition of Discovery and Youtube campaigns led to a
30% increase in new users, and sales-focused campaigns
drove a 50% increase in event registrations year over year
(2023 vs 2022).

THE CHALLENGE.

Following COVID-19, the American Lung Association needed
to revamp and relaunch their digital presence to increase
participation in their in-person Fight for Air Climb events
after consecutive years of event cancellations in an effort to
acquire new donors and increase donation revenue.
