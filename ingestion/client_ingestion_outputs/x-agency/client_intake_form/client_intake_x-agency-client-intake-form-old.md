Service Differentiation

What makes you different from your competitors? What is your “special sauce”?
 (ex: We implement 8 proprietary flows to maximally engage customers via email. 14 touch-points across a 30 day visit to our customers site has been proven to concert the highest % of site visits to paying and repeat customers)

Client Pain Points

How would your customer describe their problem in their own words? What do you do to improve their business?
 (ex: My clothing line has stopped reaching new buyers and we want to break into a new niche. Facebook keeps getting more expensive and makes it hard to target new buyers.
 Solution: Organic UGC content is the perfect mechanism to branch out to new customers. We help you find influencers who are exactly like your target audience, work with them to create videos and then use those videos to penetrate your new niche audience.)
