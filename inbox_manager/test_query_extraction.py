Hello,

We're currently evaluating marketing agencies and I have a few questions:

1. Do you have experience with demand generation campaigns?
2. What are your pricing models?
3. Can you help with both paid ads and SEO?
4. What results have you achieved for similar B2B clients?

Looking forward to hearing from you.
