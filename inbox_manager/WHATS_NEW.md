# üéâ What's New in Inbox Manager

## Latest Updates

### üéØ Sales-Oriented Response Tone (Just Added!)

The inbox manager now responds like a friendly sales rep instead of a robotic customer support bot.

**Key Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Personal greetings with first names ("Hey Sarah,")
- ‚úÖ Conversational language ("Yes --" not "Yes.")
- ‚úÖ Case studies formatted as scannable bullets
- ‚úÖ Genuine curiosity about prospect's needs
- ‚úÖ Clear calls-to-action ("Have 15-20 minutes to chat?")
- ‚úÖ **Still fully grounded** with citations - no hallucinations!

**Example Response:**
```
Hey Sarah,

Yes -- we have plenty of experience in B2B tech including Fintech, 
Healthtech, Retailtech, and logistics/ops tech. [Doc 1]

Here are some highlights from a few of our case studies in the space: 

- Clutch (retention marketing platform): 63:1 ROAS, 41% lower CPC, 
  104% more ad clicks. [Doc 5]
- "Insuretech X" (insurance software): 750% increase in site traffic, 
  510% lift in social engagement, 313% increase in inbound revenue. [Doc 2], [Doc 4]

I'm curious to hear what you're looking at for FinTech Innovations Inc. 

Have 15-20 minutes in the next week or so to chat?
